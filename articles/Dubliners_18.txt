First I used to go with girls, you know, said Corley, unbosoming;
girls off the South Circular. I used to take them out, man, on the
tram somewhere and pay the tram or take them to a band or a play at the
theatre or buy them chocolate and sweets or something that way. I used
to spend money on them right enough, he added, in a convincing tone, as
if he was conscious of being disbelieved.
But Lenehan could well believe it; he nodded gravely.
I know that game, he said, and its a mugs game.
And damn the thing I ever got out of it, said Corley.
Ditto here, said Lenehan.
Only off of one of them, said Corley.
He moistened his upper lip by running his tongue along it. The
recollection brightened his eyes. He too gazed at the pale disc of the
moon, now nearly veiled, and seemed to meditate.
She was ... a bit of all right, he said regretfully.
He was silent again. Then he added:
Shes on the turf now. I saw her driving down Earl Street one night
with two fellows with her on a car.
I suppose thats your doing, said Lenehan.
There was others at her before me, said Corley philosophically.
This time Lenehan was inclined to disbelieve. He shook his head to and
fro and smiled.
You know you cant kid me, Corley, he said.
Honest to God! said Corley. Didnt she tell me herself?
Lenehan made a tragic gesture.
Base betrayer! he said.
As they passed along the railings of Trinity College, Lenehan skipped
out into the road and peered up at the clock.
Twenty after, he said.
Time enough, said Corley. Shell be there all right. I always let her
wait a bit.
Lenehan laughed quietly.
Ecod! Corley, you know how to take them, he said.
Im up to all their little tricks, Corley confessed.
But tell me, said Lenehan again, are you sure you can bring it off
all right? You know its a ticklish job. Theyre damn close on that
point. Eh?... What?
His bright, small eyes searched his companions face for reassurance.
Corley swung his head to and fro as if to toss aside an insistent
insect, and his brows gathered.
Ill pull it off, he said. Leave it to me, cant you?
Lenehan said no more. He did not wish to ruffle his friends temper, to
be sent to the devil and told that his advice was not wanted. A little
tact was necessary. But Corleys brow was soon smooth again. His
thoughts were running another way.
Shes a fine decent tart, he said, with appreciation; thats what she
is.
They walked along Nassau Street and then turned into Kildare Street. Not
far from the porch of the club a harpist stood in the roadway, playing
to a little ring of listeners. He plucked at the wires heedlessly,
glancing quickly from time to time at the face of each new-comer and
from time to time, wearily also, at the sky. His harp, too, heedless
that her coverings had fallen about her knees, seemed weary alike of the
eyes of strangers and of her masters hands. One hand played in the bass
the melody of _Silent, O Moyle_, while the other hand careered in the
treble after each group of notes. The notes of the air sounded deep and
full.
