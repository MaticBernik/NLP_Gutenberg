_Ner_. Your father was ever virtuous; and holy men at their death have
good inspirations; therefore, the lottery that he hath devised in these
three chests, of gold, silver, and lead (whereof who chooses his meaning
chooses you), will, no doubt, never be chosen by any rightly, but one
who you shall rightly love. But what warmth is there in your affection
towards any of these princely suitors that are already come?
_Por_. I pray thee, over-name them; and as thou namest them I will
describe them; and according to my description level at my affection.
_Ner_. First, there is the Neapolitan prince.[18]
_Por_. Ay, that's a colt, indeed, for he doth nothing but talk of his
horse,[19] and he makes it a great approbation of his own good parts
that he can shoe him himself.
_Ner_. Then, is there the county Palatine.[20]
_Por_. He doth nothing but frown; as who should say, '_An you will not
have me, choose;_' he hears merry tales, and smiles not: I fear he will
prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old, being so full of
unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather to be married to a death's
head with a bone in his mouth, than to either of these. Heaven defend me
from these two!
_Ner_. How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?
_Por_. Heaven made him, and therefore let him pass for a man.
_Ner_. How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's nephew?[21]
_Por_. Very vilely in the morning, when he is sober; and most vilely in
the afternoon, when he is drunk: when he is best he is a little worse
than a man; and when he is worst he is little better than a beast: an
the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall make shift to go without
him.
_Ner_. If he should offer to choose, and choose the right casket, you
should refuse to perform your father's will if you should refuse to
accept him.
_Por_. Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee set a deep glass of
Rhenish wine on the contrary casket; for, if the devil be within, and
that temptation without, I know he will choose it.
_Ner_. You need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords; they have
acquainted me with their determinations: which is, indeed, to return to
their home and to trouble you with no more suit; unless you may be won
by some other sort than your father's imposition, depending on the
caskets.
_Por_. I am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable; for there is
not one among them but I dote on his very absence, and I wish them a
fair departure.
_Ner_. Do you not remember, lady, in your father's time, a Venetian, a
scholar, and a soldier, that came hither in company of the Marquis of
Montferrat?
_Por_. Yes, yes, it was Bassanio; as I think so was he called.
_Ner_. True, madam; he, of all the men that ever my foolish eyes looked
upon was the best deserving a fair lady.
