_Nurse_. Good heavens!--went away altogether?
_Nora_. Nurse, I want you to tell me something I have often wondered
about--how could you have the heart to put your own child out among
strangers?
_Nurse_. I was obliged to, if I wanted to be little Nora's nurse.
_Nora_. Yes, but how could you be willing to do it?
_Nurse_. What, when I was going to get such a good place by it? A poor
girl who has got into trouble should be glad to. Besides, that wicked
man didn't do a single thing for me.
_Nora_. But I suppose your daughter has quite forgotten you.
_Nurse_. No, indeed she hasn't. She wrote to me when she was confirmed,
and when she was married.
_Nora_ (_putting her arms round her neck_). Dear old Anne, you were a
good mother to me when I was little.
_Nurse_. Little Nora, poor dear, had no other mother but me.
_Nora_. And if my little ones had no other mother, I am sure you
would--What nonsense I am talking! (_Opens the box._) Go in to them. Now
I must--. You will see tomorrow how charming I shall look.
_Nurse_. I am sure there will be no one at the ball so charming as you,
ma'am. (_Goes into the room on the left._)
_Nora_ (_begins to unpack the box, but soon pushes it away from her_).
If only I dared go out. If only no one would come. If only I could be
sure nothing would happen here in the meantime. Stuff and nonsense! No
one will come. Only I mustn't think about it. I will brush my muff. What
lovely, lovely gloves! Out of my thoughts, out of my thoughts! One, two,
three, four, five, six--(_Screams._) Ah! there is someone coming--.
(_Makes a movement towards the door, but stands irresolute_.)
(_Enter_ MRS. LINDE _from the hall, where she has taken off her cloak
and hat_.)
_Nora_. Oh, it's you, Christine. There is no one else out there, is
there? How good of you to come!
_Mrs. Linde_. I heard you were up asking for me.
_Nora_. Yes, I was passing by. As a matter of fact, it is something you
could help me with. Let us sit down here on the sofa. Look here.
Tomorrow evening there is to be a fancy-dress ball at the Stenborgs',
who live above us; and Torvald wants me to go as a Neapolitan
fisher-girl, and dance the Tarantella that I learnt at Capri.
_Mrs. Linde_. I see; you are going to keep up the character.
_Nora_. Yes, Torvald wants me to. Look, here is the dress; Torvald had
it made for me there, but now it is all so torn, and I haven't any
idea--
_Mrs. Linde_. We will easily put that right. It is only some of the
trimming come unsewn here and there. Needle and thread? Now then, that's
all we want.
_Nora_. It _is_ nice of you.
_Mrs. Linde_ (_sewing_). So you are going to be dressed up tomorrow,
Nora. I will tell you what--I shall come in for a moment and see you in
your fine feathers. But I have completely forgotten to thank you for a
delightful evening yesterday.
