    _Luc._ Tranio, be so, because Lucentio loves:
    And let me be a slave, to achieve that maid
    Whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye.                 215
    Here comes the rogue.
_Enter_ BIONDELLO.
                          Sirrah, where have you been?
    _Bion._ Where have I been! Nay, how now! where are
    you? Master, has my fellow Tranio stolen your clothes?
    Or you stolen his? or both? pray, what's the news?
    _Luc._ Sirrah, come hither: 'tis no time to jest,                220
    And therefore frame your manners to the time.
    Your fellow Tranio here, to save my life,
    Puts my apparel and my countenance on,
    And I for my escape have put on his;
    For in a quarrel since I came ashore                             225
    I kill'd a man and fear I was descried:
    Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,
    While I make way from hence to save my life:
    You understand me?
    _Bion._            I, sir! ne'er a whit.
    _Luc._ And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth:                    230
    Tranio is changed into Lucentio.
    _Bion._ The better for him: would I were so too!
    _Tra._ So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after,
    That Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest daughter.
    But, sirrah, not for my sake, but your master's, I advise        235
    You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies:
    When I am alone, why, then I am Tranio;
    But in all places else your master Lucentio.
    _Luc._ Tranio, let's go: one thing more rests, that thyself
    execute, to make one among these wooers: if thou ask             240
    me why, sufficeth, my reasons are both good and weighty.
                                                      [_Exeunt._
                    _The presenters above speak._
    _First Serv._ My lord, you nod; you do not mind the play.
    _Sly._ Yes, by Saint Anne, do I. A good matter, surely:
    comes there any more of it?
    _Page._ My lord, 'tis but begun.                                 245
    _Sly._ 'Tis a very excellent piece of work, madam lady:
    would 'twere done!                     [_They sit and mark._
