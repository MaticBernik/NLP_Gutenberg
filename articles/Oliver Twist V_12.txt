Its a hard matter to get to see you, lady. If I had taken offence,
and gone away, as many would have done, youd have been sorry for it
one day, and not without reason, either.
I am very sorry if any one has behaved harshly to you, replied Rose.
Do not think of it; but tell me why you wished to see me. I am the
person you inquired for.
The kind tone of this answer, the sweet voice, the gentle manner, the
absence of any accent of haughtiness or displeasure, took the girl
completely by surprise, and she burst into tears.
Oh, lady, lady! she said, clasping her hands passionately before
her face, if there was more like you, there would be fewer like
me,there wouldthere would!
Sit down, said Rose earnestly; you distress me. If you are in
poverty or affliction I shall be truly happy to relieve you if I
can,I shall indeed. Sit down.
Let me stand, lady, said the girl, still weeping, and do not
speak to me so kindly till you know me better. It is growing late.
Isisthat door shut?
Yes, said Rose, recoiling a few steps, as if to be nearer assistance
in case she should require it. Why?
Because, said the girl, I am about to put my life and the lives of
others in your hands. I am the girl that dragged little Oliver back
to old Fagins, the Jews, on the night he went out from the house in
Pentonville.
You! said Rose Maylie.
I, lady, replied the girl. I am the infamous creature you have heard
of, that lives among the thieves, and that never from the first moment
I can recollect my eyes and senses opening on London streets have known
any better life, or kinder words than they have given me, so help me
God! Do not mind shrinking openly from me, lady. I am younger than you
would think, to look at me, but I am well used to it; the poorest women
fall back as I make my way along the crowded pavement.
What dreadful things are these! said Rose, involuntarily falling from
her strange companion.
Thank Heaven upon your knees, dear lady, cried the girl, that you
had friends to care for and keep you in your childhood, and that you
were never in the midst of cold and hunger, and riot and drunkenness,
andand something worse than allas I have been from my cradle; I may
use the word, for the alley and the gutter were mine, as they will be
my deathbed.
I pity you! said Rose in a broken voice. It wrings my heart to hear
you!
God bless you for your goodness! rejoined the girl. If you knew what
I am sometimes you would pity me, indeed. But I have stolen away from
those who would surely murder me if they knew I had been here to tell
you what I have overheard. Do you know a man named Monks?
