_Nora_. What do you want? Today it is absolutely impossible for me--
_Krogstad_. We won't talk about that till later on. This is something
different. I presume you can give me a moment?
_Nora_. Yes--yes, I can--although--
_Krogstad_. Good. I was in Olsen's Restaurant and saw your husband going
down the street--
_Nora_. Yes?
_Krogstad_. With a lady.
_Nora_. What then?
_Krogstad_. May I make so bold as to ask if it was a Mrs. Linde?
_Nora_. It was.
_Krogstad_. Just arrived in town?
_Nora_. Yes, today.
_Krogstad_. She is a great friend of yours, isn't she?
_Nora_: She is. But I don't see--
_Krogstad_. I knew her too, once upon a time.
_Nora_. I am aware of that.
_Krogstad_. Are you? So you know all about it; I thought as much. Then I
can ask you, without beating about the bush--is Mrs. Linde to have an
appointment in the Bank?
_Nora_. What right have you to question me, Mr. Krogstad?--You, one of
my husband's subordinates! But since you ask, you shall know. Yes, Mrs.
Linde _is_ to have an appointment. And it was I who pleaded her cause,
Mr. Krogstad, let me tell you that.
_Krogstad_. I was right in what I thought, then.
_Nora_ (_walking up and down the stage_). Sometimes one has a tiny
little bit of influence, I should hope. Because one is a woman, it does
not necessarily follow that--. When anyone is in a subordinate position,
Mr. Krogstad, they should really be careful to avoid offending anyone
who--who--
_Krogstad_. Who has influence?
_Nora_. Exactly.
_Krogstad_ (_changing his tone_). Mrs. Helmer, you will be so good as to
use your influence on my behalf.
_Nora_. What? What do you mean?
_Krogstad_. You will be so kind as to see that I am allowed to keep my
subordinate position in the Bank.
_Nora_. What do you mean by that? Who proposes to take your post away
from you?
_Krogstad_. Oh, there is no necessity to keep up the pretence of
ignorance. I can quite understand that your friend is not very anxious
to expose herself to the chance of rubbing shoulders with me; and I
quite understand, too, whom I have to thank for being turned off.
_Nora_. But I assure you--
_Krogstad_. Very likely; but, to come to the point, the time has come
when I should advise you to use your influence to prevent that.
_Nora_. But, Mr. Krogstad, I _have_ no influence.
_Krogstad_. Haven't you? I thought you said yourself just now--
_Nora_. Naturally I did not mean you to put that construction on it. I!
What should make you think I have any influence of that kind with my
husband?
_Krogstad_. Oh, I have known your husband from our student days. I don't
suppose he is any more unassailable than other husbands.
_Nora_. If you speak slightly of my husband, I shall turn you out of the
house.
_Krogstad_. You are bold, Mrs. Helmer.
_Nora_. I am not afraid of you any longer, As soon as the New Year
comes, I shall in a very short time be free of the whole thing.
