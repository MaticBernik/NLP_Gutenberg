_Jul._ I must, where is no remedy.
_Pro._ When possibly I can, I will return.
_Jul._ If you turn not, you will return the sooner.
Keep this remembrance for thy Julia's sake.                          5
                                            [_Giving a ring._
_Pro._ Why, then, we'll make exchange; here, take you this.
_Jul._ And seal the bargain with a holy kiss.
_Pro._ Here is my hand for my true constancy;
And when that hour o'erslips me in the day
Wherein I sigh not, Julia, for thy sake,                            10
The next ensuing hour some foul mischance
Torment me for my love's forgetfulness!
My father stays my coming; answer not;
The tide is now:--nay, not thy tide of tears;
That tide will stay me longer than I should.                        15
Julia, farewell!    [_Exit Julia._
                  What, gone without a word?
Ay, so true love should do: it cannot speak;
For truth hath better deeds than words to grace it.
  _Enter PANTHINO._
_Pan._ Sir Proteus, you are stay'd for.
_Pro._ Go; I come, I come.                                          20
Alas! this parting strikes poor lovers dumb.    [_Exeunt._

SCENE III. _The same. A street._
  _Enter LAUNCE, leading a dog._
_Launce._ Nay, 'twill be this hour ere I have done weeping;
all the kind of the Launces have this very fault. I have
received my proportion, like the prodigious son, and am
going with Sir Proteus to the Imperial's court. I think Crab
my dog be the sourest-natured dog that lives: my mother              5
weeping, my father wailing, my sister crying, our maid
howling, our cat wringing her hands, and all our house in a
great perplexity, yet did not this cruel-hearted cur shed one
tear: he is a stone, a very pebble stone, and has no more
pity in him than a dog: a Jew would have wept to have               10
seen our parting; why, my grandam, having no eyes, look
you, wept herself blind at my parting. Nay, I'll shew you
the manner of it. This shoe is my father: no, this left shoe
is my father: no, no, this left shoe is my mother: nay, that
cannot be so neither: yes, it is so, it is so, it hath the worser   15
sole. This shoe, with the hole in it, is my mother, and this
my father; a vengeance on't! there 'tis: now, sir, this staff is
my sister, for, look you, she is as white as a lily, and as
small as a wand: this hat is Nan, our maid: I am the dog:
no, the dog is himself, and I am the dog,--Oh! the dog is           20
me, and I am myself; ay, so, so. Now come I to my
father; Father, your blessing: now should not the shoe
speak a word for weeping: now should I kiss my father;
well, he weeps on. Now come I to my mother: O, that
she could speak now like a wood woman! Well, I kiss her;            25
why, there 'tis; here's my mother's breath up and down.
Now come I to my sister; mark the moan she makes. Now
the dog all this while sheds not a tear, nor speaks a word;
but see how I lay the dust with my tears.
