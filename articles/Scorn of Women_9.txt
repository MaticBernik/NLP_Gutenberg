_(Mrs. Eppingwell and Capt. Eppingwell walk over to left rear to
Loraine Lisznayi and Prince.)_
_(Mail Carrier tries to get to stove, but is blocked by miners, who are
demanding: "What's the news?" "How's the trail?" "Any letters for me?"
"And me?" "And me?" "Where did you meet O'Brien? He left ten days ago."
"How's the ice on Thirty Mile River?" etc.y etc. To all of which Mail
Carrier replies by waving his arms and thrusting through the crowd till
he gets to stove, over which he holds his Face.)_
_(Dave Harney enters from left, still in towering rage, but his jace
lights up, as though struck by a sudden thought when he catches sight
oj Mail Carrier. He strides over, clutches Mail Carrier by the arm and
draws him to one side.)_
DAVE HARNEY
_(In a whisper.)_
Got a noospaper?
MAIL CARRIER
_(Nods head.)_
DAVE HARNEY
How many?
MAIL CARRIER
_(Holds up one finger.)_
DAVE HARNEY
I'll give you twenty dollars for it.
MAIL CARRIER
_(Shakes head.)_
DAVE HARNEY
_(Bidding rapidly, each bid being met by a shake of Mail Carrier's
head.)_ Twenty-five. Thirty. Thirty-five. Forty. Fifty.
MAIL CARRIER
_(Nods head and goes back to stove.)_
_(Freda walks forward toward stove and beckons to Sitka Charley, who
leaves group about stove and comes to her.)_
FREDA
Tell the Mail Carrier I want to speak to him, Charley.
SITKA CHARLEY
_(Obediently.)_
Urn.
_(Sitka Charley crosses to stove, where Mail Carrier is pulling the
ice from his mouth.)_
Freda want talk some with you.
MAIL CARRIER
_(Turning to look at Freda, nods head and mumbles incoherently, at
same time starting to go to Freda and still pulling ice jrom mouth. He
shakes hands with Freda and speaks thickly at first.)_
How do do, Freda.
FREDA
How do you do, Joe. What kind of a trip did you have?
MAIL CARRIER
Pretty rough, but I made good time just the same. Passed everything in
sight.
FREDA
That is what I wanted to ask you about. Did you pass the outfit of a
girl, or, rather, of a young woman?
MAIL CARRIER
Coming in by herself, with a dog-puncher and an Indian?
FREDA
Yes. Where did you pass her?
MAIL CARRIER
Yesterday afternoon, about three o'clock. They were making camp early.
She was pretty tired from the looks of her.
FREDA
When should she get in?
MAIL CARRIER
I talked with the dog-puncher. He said they'd camp to-night at
Mooseback and come in tomorrow. That's twenty-five miles, and if they
don't start too late, they'll make Dawson by the middle of the day.
FREDA
What kind of a girl is she?
MAIL CARRIER
Good. How do you mean?
FREDA
I mean what kind of a looking girl is she? How did she strike you?
MAIL CARRIER
Oh, one of the soft and clingy kind, I guess I'd call her. You know,
the kind that needs lots of cuddling and petting. Pretty, yes, danged
pretty. Blue eyes, wavy hair, and all the rest--trembly lips and teary
eyes--smily and weepy, you know, all in the same moment. But, gee!
Freda, I can't stand here gassin' all day. I got about a thousand
dollars' worth of letters to deliver--a dollar apiece and cheap at the
price. I'll see you later. So long.
