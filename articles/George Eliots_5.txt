Mr. Lewes sends his best regards. He is in high spirits about the
poem.
[Sidenote: Journal, 1867.]
_Nov. 22._--Began an "Address to the Working Men, by Felix Holt," at
Blackwood's repeated request.
[Sidenote: Letter to Miss Sara Hennell, 22d Nov. 1867.]
Yes, indeed--when I do _not_ reciprocate "chaos is come again." I was
quite sure your letter would come, and was grateful beforehand.
There is a scheme on foot for a Woman's College, or, rather,
University, to be built between London and Cambridge, and to be in
connection with the Cambridge University, sharing its professors,
examinations, and degrees! _Si muove._
[Sidenote: Letter to Madame Bodichon, 1st Dec. (?) 1867.]
I have written to Miss Davies to ask her to come to see me on Tuesday.
I am much occupied just now, but the better education of women is one
of the objects about which I have _no doubt_, and shall rejoice if
this idea of a college can be carried out.
I see Miss Julia Smith's beautiful handwriting, and am glad to think
of her as your guardian angel.
The author of the glorious article on the Talmud _is_ "that bright
little man" Mr. Deutsch--a very dear, delightful creature.
[Sidenote: Journal, 1867.]
_Dec. 4._--Sent off the MS. of the "Address" to Edinburgh.
[Sidenote: Letter to John Blackwood, 7th Dec. 1867.]
I agree with you about the phrase "Masters of the country."[3] I wrote
that part twice, and originally I distinctly said that the epithet was
false. Afterwards I left that out, preferring to make a stronger
_argumentum ad hominem_, in case any workman believed himself a future
master.
I think it will be better for you to write a preliminary note, washing
your hands of any over-trenchant statements on the part of the
well-meaning Radical. I much prefer that you should do so.
Whatever you agree with will have the advantage of not coming from one
who can be suspected of being a special pleader.
What you say about Fedalma is very cheering. But I am chiefly anxious
about the road still untravelled--the road I have still _zurueck zu
legen_.
Mr. Lewes has to request several proofs of Fedalma, to facilitate
revision. But I will leave him to say how many. We shall keep them
strictly to ourselves, you may be sure, so that three or four will be
enough--one for him, one for me, and one for the resolution of our
differences.
[Sidenote: Letter to John Blackwood 12th Dec. 1867.]
I am very grateful to you for your generous words about my work. That
you not only feel so much sympathy, but are moved to express it so
fully, is a real help to me.
I am very glad to have had the revise of the "Address." I feel the
danger of not being understood. Perhaps, by a good deal longer
consideration and gradual shaping, I might have put the ideas into a
more concrete, easy form.
Mr. Lewes read the proof of the poem all through to himself for the
first time last night, and expressed great satisfaction in the
impression it produced. Your suggestion of having it put into type is
a benefit for which we have reason to be obliged to you.
