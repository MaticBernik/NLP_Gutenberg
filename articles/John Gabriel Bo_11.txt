ERHART.
  [Involuntarily.]  Oh, that!  [Collecting himself.]  Well, you
wouldn't have me sit here and keep Aunt Ella up half the night?
Remember, she's an invalid, mother.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  You are going to the Hinkels', Erhart!
ERHART.
  [Impatiently.]  Well, really, mother, I don't think I can well
get out of it.  What do you say, Aunt?
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  I should like you to feel quite free, Erhart.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Goes up to her menacingly.]  You want to take him away from me!
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Rising.]  Yes, if only I could, Gunhild!
    [Music is heard from above.
ERHART.
  [Writhing as if in pain.]  Oh, I can't endure this!  [Looking
round.]  What have I done with my hat?  [To ELLA RENTHEIM.]  Do
you know the air that she is playing up there?
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  No.  What is it?
ERHART.
  It's the _Danse Macabre_--the Dance of Death!  Don't you know
the Dance of Death, Aunt?
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Smiling sadly.]  Not yet, Erhart.
ERHART.
  [To MRS. BORKMAN.]  Mother--I beg and implore you--let me go!
MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Looks hardly at him.]  Away from your mother?  So that is what
you want to do?
ERHART.
  Of course I'll come out again--to-morrow perhaps.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  [With passionate emotion.]  You want to go away from me!  To be
with those strange people!  With--with--no, I will not even think
of it!
ERHART.
  There are bright lights down there, and young, happy faces; and
there's music there, mother!
MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Pointing upwards.]  There is music here, too, Erhart.
ERHART.
  Yes, it's just that music that drives me out of the house.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Do you grudge your father a moment of self-forgetfulness?
ERHART.
  No, I don't.  I'm very, very glad that he should have it--if
only _I_ don't have to listen.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Looking solemnly at him.]  Be strong, Erhart!  Be strong, my
son!  Do not forget that you have your great mission.
ERHART.
  Oh, mother--do spare me these phrases!  I wasn't born to be
a "missionary."--Good-night, aunt dear!  Good-night, mother.
    [He goes hastily out through the hall.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  [After a short silence.]  It has not taken you long to recapture
him, Ella, after all.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  I wish I could believe it.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  But you shall see you won't be allowed to keep him long.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Allowed?  By you, do you mean?
MRS. BORKMAN.
  By me or--by her, the other one----
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Then rather she than you.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Nodding slowly.]  That I understand.  I say the same.  Rather
she than you.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Whatever should become of him in the end----
MRS. BORKMAN.
  It wouldn't greatly matter, I should say.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Taking her outdoor things upon her arm.]  For the first time in
our lives, we twin sisters are of one mind.  Good-night, Gunhild.
    [She goes out by the hall.  The music sounds louder from above.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Stands still for a moment, starts, shrinks together, and
whispers involuntarily.]  The wolf is whining again--the sick wolf.
[She stands still for a moment, then flings herself down on the
floor, writhing in agony and whispering:]  Erhart! Erhart!--be
true to me!  Oh, come home and help your mother!  For I can bear
this life no longer!
