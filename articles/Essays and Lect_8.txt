Now, in entire opposition to this modern inductive principle of research
stands the philosophic Plato, whose account of primitive man is entirely
speculative and deductive.
The origin of society he ascribes to necessity, the mother of all
inventions, and imagines that individual man began deliberately to herd
together on account of the advantages of the principle of division of
labour and the rendering of mutual need.
It must, however, be borne in mind that Platos object in this whole
passage in the _Republic_ was, perhaps, not so much to analyse the
conditions of early society as to illustrate the importance of the
division of labour, the shibboleth of his political economy, by showing
what a powerful factor it must have been in the most primitive as well as
in the most complex states of society; just as in the _Laws_ he almost
rewrites entirely the history of the Peloponnesus in order to prove the
necessity of a balance of power.  He surely, I mean, must have recognised
himself how essentially incomplete his theory was in taking no account of
the origin of family life, the position and influence of women, and other
social questions, as well as in disregarding those deeper motives of
religion, which are such important factors in early civilisation, and
whose influence Aristotle seems to have clearly apprehended, when he says
that the aim of primitive society was not merely life but the higher
life, and that in the origin of society utility is not the sole motive,
but that there is something spiritual in it if, at least, spiritual
will bring out the meaning of that complex expression _<U+03C4><U+1F78> <U+03BA><U+03B1><U+03BB><U+03CC><U+03BD>_.
Otherwise, the whole account in the _Republic_ of primitive man will
always remain as a warning against the intrusion of _a priori_
speculations in the domain appropriate to induction.
Now, Aristotles theory of the origin of society, like his philosophy of
ethics, rests ultimately on the principle of final causes, not in the
theological meaning of an aim or tendency imposed from without, but in
the scientific sense of function corresponding to organ.  Nature maketh
no thing in vain is the text of Aristotle in this as in other inquiries.
Man being the only animal possessed of the power of rational speech is,
he asserts, by nature intended to be social, more so than the bee or any
other gregarious animal.
He is _<U+03C6><U+03CD><U+03C3><U+03B5><U+03B9> <U+03C0><U+03BF><U+03BB><U+03B9><U+03C4><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03CC><U+03C2>_, and the national tendency towards higher forms
of perfection brings the armed savage who used to sell his wife to the
free independence of a free state, and to the _<U+1F30><U+03C3><U+03CC><U+03C4><U+03B7><U+03C2> <U+03C4><U+03BF><U+1FE6> <U+1F04><U+03C1><U+03C7><U+03B5><U+03B9><U+03BD> <U+03BA><U+03B1><U+1F76> <U+03C4><U+03BF><U+1FE6>
<U+1F04><U+03C1><U+03C7><U+03B5><U+03C3><U+03B8><U+03B1><U+03B9>_, which was the test of true citizenship.  The stages passed
through by humanity start with the family first as the ultimate unit.
The conglomeration of families forms a village ruled by that patriarchal
sway which is the oldest form of government in the world, as is shown by
the fact that all men count it to be the constitution of heaven, and the
villages are merged into the state, and here the progression stops.
