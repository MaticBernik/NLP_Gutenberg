_Lau_. I will go before, Sir.--
Mistress, look out at window, for all this;
     There will come a Christian by,
     Will be worth a Jewess' eye.[67]
[_Exit_ LAUNCELOT.
_Shy_. What says that fool of Hagar's offspring, ha?
_Jes_. His words were, Farewell, mistress; nothing else.
_Shy_. The patch is kind enough;[68] but a huge feeder,
Snail-slow in profit, and he sleeps by day
More than the wild cat: drones hive not with me,
Therefore I part with him; and part with him
To one that I would have him help to waste
His borrow'd purse.--Well, Jessica, go in;
Perhaps, I will return immediately;
Do as I bid you,
Shut doors after you: Fast bind, fast find;
A proverb never stale in thrifty mind.
[_Exit_.
_Jes_. Farewell; and if my fortune be not crost,
I have a father, you a daughter, lost.
[_Exit into house_.
_Enter_ GRATIANO _and_ SALARINO, _masqued_.
_Gra_. This is the pent-house, under which Lorenzo
Desir'd us to make stand.
_Sal_. His hour is almost past.
_Gra_. And it is marvel he out-dwells his hour,
For lovers ever run before the clock.
_Sal_. O, ten times faster Venus' pigeons fly
To seal love's bonds new made, than they are wont
To keep obliged faith unforfeited!
_Gra_. That ever holds: who riseth from a feast,
With that keen appetite that he sits down?
Where is the horse that doth untread again
His tedious measures with the unbated fire
That he did pace them first? All things that are,
Are with more spirit chased than enjoy'd.
_Enter_ LORENZO.
_Sal_. Here comes Lorenzo.
_Lor_. Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode:
Not I, but my affairs, have made you wait:
When you shall please to play the thieves for wives,
I'll watch as long for you then.--
Here dwells my father Jew:--
    GLEE.[69]
            O happy fair!
        Your eyes are lode-stars, and your tongue sweet air!
        More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear
        When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear![70]
Ho! who's within?
_Enter_ JESSICA, _above_.
_Jes_. Who are you? Tell me, for more certainty,
Albeit I'll swear that I do know your tongue.
_Lor_. Lorenzo, and thy love.
_Jes_. Lorenzo, certain; and my love, indeed;
For who love I so much? And now who knows
But you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours?
_Lor_. Heaven, and thy thoughts, are witness that thou art.
_Jes_. Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains.
_Lor_. Come, come at once;
For the close night doth play the run-away,
And we are staid for at Bassanio's feast.
_Jes_. I will make fast the doors, and gild myself
With some more ducats, and be with you straight.
[_Exit from above_.
_Gra_. Now, by my hood, a Gentile and no Jew.[71]
_Lor_. Beshrew me, but I love her heartily:
For she is wise, if I can judge of her;
And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true;
And true she is, as she hath prov'd herself;
And therefore, like herself, wise, fair, and true,
Shall she be placed in my constant soul.
