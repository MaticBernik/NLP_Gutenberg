_(Storms out through door to lejt.)_
_(Sitka Charley returns to Mrs. Eppingwell.)_

MRS. EPPINGWELL
Tell me about this--er--this woman, Charley, this Freda--Freda Moloof
her name is, isn't it?
SITKA CHARLEY
_(Showing plainly that his attention has been called off from the
consideration of Loraine Lisznayi.)_
Oh, Freda!
MRS. EPPINGWELL
_(Smiling.)_
You call her Freda.
SITKA CHARLEY
Everybody call her Freda. Um good name. Me like it.
MRS. EPPINGWELL
Well, what kind of a woman is she?
SITKA CHARLEY
Um good woman.
MRS. EPPINGWELL
_(With an angry movement of arm and clenching of hand.)_
Oh!
SITKA CHARLEY
_(Looking surprised and getting stubborn.)_ Me know Freda long
time--two years. Um good woman. Um tongue speak true. Um just like
you, no afraid. Um just like you, travel Long Trail with me. No

MRS. EPPINGWELL
Yes, yes. Go on.
SITKA CHARLEY
_(Considering.)_

MRS. EPPINGWELL
Now that is too much, Charley? How about Mr. Vanderlip?
SITKA CHARLEY
_(Shrugs his shoulders.)_
I know Freda long time. Freda know Vanderlip short time. Maybe Freda
like Vanderlip. I don't know. But before she never like men, that I

and Sitka Charley grows more positive.)_ Vanderlip come your cabin all
the time. You ride on Vanderlip's sled. I know. I see. Maybe you like
Vanderlip.
MRS. EPPINGWELL
You don't understand, Charley. I have reasons for being nice to Mr.
Vanderlip.
SITKA CHARLEY
_(Sceptically.)_
Um.
MRS. EPPINGWELL
And, Charley, you mustn't tell anybody what you have told me about Mr.
Vanderlip going away to-night with that--that woman.
SITKA CHARLEY
_(Weighing her words.)_
Maybe I tell Freda.
MRS. EPPINGWELL
_(Stamping foot angrily.)_
Don't be foolish, Charley. She is the last person in the world who
ought to know. Of course you'll not tell her. Tell no one.
_(Sitka Charley hesitates.)_
Promise me you'll not tell. Promise me by the faith of food and
blanket.
SITKA CHARLEY
_(Reluctantly.)_
All right, I no tell.
MRS. EPPINGWELL
They say Freda is a dancer. Have you seen her dance?
SITKA CHARLEY
_(Nodding his heady a pleased expression on his face.)_
I see um. Very good dance. Um dance at Juneau, two years ago, first
time I see. Treadwell Mine no work that day. No men to work. All men
come Juneau and look see Freda dance. Freda makum much money. Um speak

SITKA CHARLEY
_(Nodding head vigorously.)_
Um, sure. Me like her too, very much.

_(Smiling tolerantly.)_
And they say she makes fools of men.
SITKA CHARLEY
