Theyre not Fishers. Theyre five times better than Fishers, and this
ones ten times better!
Tommy groaned.
I must have been drinking unawares! Am I dreaming, Tuppence, or do I
really behold a large quantity of five-pound notes being waved about in
a dangerous fashion?
Even so, O King! _Now_, will you come and have lunch?
Ill come anywhere. But what have you been doing? Holding up a bank?
All in good time. What an awful place Piccadilly Circus is. Theres a
huge bus bearing down on us. It would be too terrible if they killed the
five-pound notes!
Grill room? inquired Tommy, as they reached the opposite pavement in
safety.
The others more expensive, demurred Tuppence.
Thats mere wicked wanton extravagance. Come on below.
Are you sure I can get all the things I want there?
That extremely unwholesome menu you were outlining just now? Of course
you can--or as much as is good for you, anyway.
And now tell me, said Tommy, unable to restrain his pent-up curiosity
any longer, as they sat in state surrounded by the many _hors douvre_
of Tuppences dreams.
Miss Cowley told him.
And the curious part of it is, she ended, that I really did invent
the name of Jane Finn! I didnt want to give my own because of poor
father--in case I should get mixed up in anything shady.
Perhaps thats so, said Tommy slowly. But you didnt invent it.
What?
No. _I_ told it to you. Dont you remember, I said yesterday Id
overheard two people talking about a female called Jane Finn? Thats
what brought the name into your mind so pat.
So you did. I remember now. How extraordinary---- Tuppence tailed off
into silence. Suddenly she aroused herself. Tommy!
Yes?
What were they like, the two men you passed?
Tommy frowned in an effort at remembrance.
One was a big fat sort of chap. Clean shaven, I think--and dark.
Thats him, cried Tuppence, in an ungrammatical squeal. Thats
Whittington! What was the other man like?
I cant remember. I didnt notice him particularly. It was really the
outlandish name that caught my attention.
And people say that coincidences dont happen! Tuppence tackled her
Peche Melba happily.
But Tommy had become serious.
Look here, Tuppence, old girl, what is this going to lead to?
More money, replied his companion.
I know that. Youve only got one idea in your head. What I mean is,
what about the next step? How are you going to keep the game up?
Oh! Tuppence laid down her spoon. Youre right, Tommy, it is a bit of
a poser.
After all, you know, you cant bluff him forever. Youre sure to slip
up sooner or later. And, anyway, Im not at all sure that it isnt
actionable--blackmail, you know.
Nonsense. Blackmail is saying youll tell unless you are given
money. Now, theres nothing I could tell, because I dont really know
anything.
Hm, said Tommy doubtfully. Well, anyway, what _are_ we going to do?
Whittington was in a hurry to get rid of you this morning, but next time
hell want to know something more before he parts with his money. Hell
want to know how much _you_ know, and where you got your information
from, and a lot of other things that you cant cope with. What are you
going to do about it?
