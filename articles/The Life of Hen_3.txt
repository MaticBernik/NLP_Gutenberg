KING.
What was that Henton?
SURVEYOR.
Sir, a Chartreux friar,
His confessor; who fed him every minute
With words of sovereignty.
KING.
How know'st thou this?
SURVEYOR.
Not long before your Highness sped to France,
The Duke being at the Rose, within the parish
Saint Lawrence Poultney, did of me demand
What was the speech among the Londoners
Concerning the French journey. I repli'd,
Men fear the French would prove perfidious,
To the King's danger. Presently the Duke
Said, 'twas the fear, indeed; and that he doubted
'Twould prove the verity of certain words
Spoke by a holy monk, "that oft," says he,
"Hath sent to me, wishing me to permit
John de la Car, my chaplain, a choice hour
To hear from him a matter of some moment;
Whom after under the confession's seal
He solemnly had sworn, that what he spoke
My chaplain to no creature living but
To me should utter, with demure confidence
This pausingly ensu'd: 'Neither the King nor's heirs,
Tell you the Duke, shall prosper.  Bid him strive
To gain the love o' the commonalty.  The Duke
Shall govern England."'
QUEEN KATHERINE.
If I know you well,
You were the Duke's surveyor, and lost your office
On the complaint o' the tenants. Take good heed
You charge not in your spleen a noble person
And spoil your nobler soul; I say, take heed;
Yes, heartily beseech you.
KING.
Let him on.
Go forward.
SURVEYOR.
On my soul, I'll speak but truth.
I told my lord the Duke, by the devil's illusions
The monk might be deceiv'd; and that 'twas dangerous for him
To ruminate on this so far, until
It forg'd him some design; which, being believ'd,
It was much like to do. He answer'd, "Tush,
It can do me no damage;" adding further
That, had the King in his last sickness fail'd,
The Cardinal's and Sir Thomas Lovell's heads
Should have gone off.
KING.
Ha! what, so rank? Ah ha!
There's mischief in this man. Canst thou say further?
SURVEYOR.
I can, my liege.
KING.
Proceed.
SURVEYOR.
Being at Greenwich,
After your Highness had reprov'd the Duke
About Sir William Bulmer,--
KING.
I remember
Of such a time; being my sworn servant,
The Duke retain'd him his. But on; what hence?
SURVEYOR.
"If," quoth he, "I for this had been committed,"
--As, to the Tower, I thought,--"I would have play'd
The part my father meant to act upon
The usurper Richard; who, being at Salisbury,
Made suit to come in 's presence; which if granted,
As he made semblance of his duty, would
Have put his knife into him."
KING.
A giant traitor!
WOLSEY.
Now, madam, may his Highness live in freedom,
And this man out of prison?
QUEEN KATHERINE.
God mend all!
KING.
There's something more would out of thee; what say'st?
SURVEYOR.
After "the Duke his father," with "the knife,"
He stretch'd him, and, with one hand on his dagger,
Another spread on 's breast, mounting his eyes,
He did discharge a horrible oath; whose tenour
Was, were he evil us'd, he would outgo
His father by as much as a performance
Does an irresolute purpose.
