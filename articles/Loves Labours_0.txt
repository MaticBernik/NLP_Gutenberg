COSTARD.
Me.
KING.
'that unlettered small-knowing soul,'--
COSTARD.
Me.
KING.
'that shallow vassal,'--
COSTARD.
Still me.--
KING.
'which, as I remember, hight Costard,'--
COSTARD.
O me.
KING.
'sorted and consorted, contrary to thy established proclaimed
edict and continent canon, with--with,--O! with but with this I
passion to say wherewith,'--
COSTARD.
With a wench.
KING.
'with a child of our grandmother Eve, a female; or, for thy
more sweet understanding, a woman. Him, I,--as my ever-esteemed
duty pricks me on,--have sent to thee, to receive the meed of
punishment, by thy sweet Grace's officer, Antony Dull, a man of
good repute, carriage, bearing, and estimation.'
DULL.
Me, an't please you; I am Antony Dull.
KING.
'For Jaquenetta,--so is the weaker vessel called, which I
apprehended with the aforesaid swain,--I keep her as a vessel of
thy law's fury; and shall, at the least of thy sweet notice,
bring her to trial. Thine, in all compliments of devoted and
heart-burning heat of duty,
DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO.'
BEROWNE.
This is not so well as I looked for, but the best that ever I
heard.
KING.
Ay, the best for the worst. But, sirrah, what say you to this?
COSTARD.
Sir, I confess the wench.
KING.
Did you hear the proclamation?
COSTARD.
I do confess much of the hearing it, but little of the
marking of it.
KING.
It was proclaimed a year's imprisonment to be taken with a
wench.
COSTARD.
I was taken with none, sir: I was taken with a damosel.
KING.
Well, it was proclaimed 'damosel'.
COSTARD.
This was no damosel neither, sir; she was a 'virgin'.
KING.
It is so varied too; for it was proclaimed 'virgin'.
COSTARD.
If it were, I deny her virginity: I was taken with a maid.
KING.
This maid not serve your turn, sir.
COSTARD.
This maid will serve my turn, sir.
KING.
Sir, I will pronounce your sentence: you shall fast a week
with bran and water.
COSTARD.
I had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge.
KING.
And Don Armado shall be your keeper.
My Lord Berowne, see him delivered o'er:
And go we, lords, to put in practice that
  Which each to other hath so strongly sworn.
[Exeunt KING, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN.]
BEROWNE.
I'll lay my head to any good man's hat
These oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn.
Sirrah, come on.
COSTARD.
I suffer for the truth, sir: for true it is I was taken
with Jaquenetta, and Jaquenetta is a true girl; and therefore
welcome the sour cup of prosperity! Affliction may one day smile
again; and till then, sit thee down, sorrow!
[Exeunt.]
SCENE II. The park.
[Enter ARMADO and MOTH.]
ARMADO.
Boy, what sign is it when a man of great spirit grows
melancholy?
MOTH.
A great sign, sir, that he will look sad.
ARMADO.
Why, sadness is one and the self-same thing, dear imp.
MOTH.
No, no; O Lord, sir, no.
ARMADO.
How canst thou part sadness and melancholy, my tender
juvenal?
MOTH.
By a familiar demonstration of the working, my tough senior.
