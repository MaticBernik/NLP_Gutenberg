Secondly, the case of fancy-prices. Here I think the simplest plan is
to divide the payment into two parts, the market-value and the excess
over that. The market-value part is on the same footing as in the
first case: the _excess_ is all we have to consider. Well, A, B, C do
not _earn_ it; so we may put _them_ out of the question: it is a _gift_,
from X, Y, Z, to the Hospital. And my opinion is that it is not given in
the best way: far better buy what they choose to _buy_, and give what
they choose to _give_, as two _separate_ transactions: then there is
_some_ chance that their motive in giving may be real charity, instead
of a mixed motivehalf charity, half self-pleasing. The trail of the
serpent is over it all. And _therefore_ it is that I hold all such
spurious Charities in _utter_ abomination! He ended with unusual
energy, and savagely beheaded, with his stick, a tall thistle at the
road-side, behind which I was startled to see Sylvie and Bruno standing.
I caught at his arm, but too late to stop him. Whether the stick reached
them, or not, I could not feel sure: at any rate they took not the
smallest notice of it, but smiled gaily, and nodded to me; and I saw at
once that they were only visible to _me_: the eerie influence had not
reached to _Arthur_.
Why did you try to save it? he said. _Thats_ not the wheedling
Secretary of a Charity-Bazaar! I only wish it were! he added grimly.
Doos oo know, that stick went right froo my head! said Bruno. (They
had run round to me by this time, and each had secured a hand.) Just
under my chin! I _are_ glad I arent a thistle!
Well, weve threshed _that_ subject out, anyhow! Arthur resumed. Im
afraid Ive been talking too much, for _your_ patience and for my
strength. I must be turning soon. This is about the end of my tether.
  Take, O boatman, thrice thy fee;
  Take, I give it willingly;
  For, invisible to thee,
  Spirits twain have crossed with me!
I quoted, involuntarily.
For utterly inappropriate and irrelevant quotations, laughed Arthur,
you are ekalled by few, and excelled by none! And we strolled on.
As we passed the head of the lane that led down to the beach, I noticed
a single figure, moving slowly along it, seawards. She was a good way
off, and had her back to us: but it was Lady Muriel, unmistakably.
Knowing that Arthur had not seen her, as he had been looking, in the
other direction, at a gathering rain-cloud, I made no remark, but tried
to think of some plausible pretext for sending him back by the sea.
The opportunity instantly presented itself. Im getting tired, he
said. I dont think it would be prudent to go further. I had better
turn here.
I turned with him, for a few steps, and as we again approached the head
of the lane, I said, as carelessly as I could, Dont go back by the
road. Its too hot and dusty. Down this lane, and along the beach, is
nearly as short; and youll get a breeze off the sea.
