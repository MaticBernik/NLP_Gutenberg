PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Is that why you are so ready to set off with him--out into the wilds?
MAIA.
[Curtly.] I don't know. [Turning towards him.] You are ugly, too, Rubek.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Have you only just discovered it?
MAIA.
No, I have seen it for long.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Shrugging his shoulders.] One doesn't grow younger. One doesn't grow
younger, Frau Maia.
MAIA.
It's not that sort of ugliness that I mean at all. But there has come to
be such an expression of fatigue, of utter weariness, in your eyes--when
you deign, once in a while, to cast a glance at me.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Have you noticed that?
MAIA.
[Nods.] Little by little this evil look has come into your eyes. It
seems almost as though you were nursing some dark plot against me.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Indeed? [In a friendly but earnest tone.] Come here and sit beside me,
Maia; and let us talk a little.
MAIA.
[Half rising.] Then will you let me sit upon your knee? As I used to in
the early days?
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
No, you mustn't--people can see us from the hotel. [Moves a little.] But
you can sit here on the bench--at my side.
MAIA.
No, thank you; in that case I'd rather lie here, where I am. I can hear
you quite well here. [Looks inquiringly at him.] Well, what is it you
want to say to me?
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Begins slowly.] What do you think was my real reason for agreeing to
make this tour?
MAIA.
Well--I remember you declared, among other things, that it was going to
do me such a tremendous lot of good. But--but--
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
But--?
MAIA.
But now I don't believe the least little bit that that was the reason--
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Then what is your theory about it now?
MAIA.
I think now that it was on account of that pale lady.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Madame von Satow--!
MAIA.
Yes, she who is always hanging at our heels. Yesterday evening she made
her appearance up here too.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
But what in all the world--!
MAIA.
Oh, I know you knew her very well indeed--long before you knew me.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
And had forgotten her, too--long before I knew you.
MAIA.
[Sitting upright.] Can you forget so easily, Rubek?
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Curtly.] Yes, very easily indeed. [Adds harshly.] When I want to
forget.
MAIA.
Even a woman who has been a model to you?
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
When I have no more use for her--
MAIA.
One who has stood to you undressed?
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
That means nothing--nothing for us artists. [With a change of tone.]
And then--may I venture to ask--how was I to guess that she was in this
country?
MAIA.
Oh, you might have seen her name in a Visitor's List--in one of the
newspapers.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
But I had no idea of the name she now goes by. I had never heard of any
Herr von Satow.
MAIA.
[Affecting weariness.] Oh well then, I suppose it must have been for
some other reason that you were so set upon this journey.
