Wangel. So he would not release you?
Ellida. No. Then I wrote again, almost word for word as I had before; or
perhaps more firmly.
Wangel. And he gave in?
Ellida. Oh, no! Don't think that! He wrote quietly, as before--not a
word of my having broken with him. Then I knew it was useless, and so I
never wrote to him again.
Wangel. And you never heard from him?
Ellida. Oh, yes! I have had three letters since then. Once he wrote to
me from California, and a second time from China. The last letter I had
from him was from Australia. He wrote he was going to the gold-mines;
but since then he has made no sign.
Wangel. This man has had a strange power over you, Ellida.
Ellida. Yes, yes! The terrible man!
Wangel. But you mustn't think of that any more. Never again--never!
Promise me that, my dear, beloved Ellida. Now we must try another
treatment for you. Fresher air than here within the fjords. The salt,
fresh air of the sea! Dear, what say you to that?
Ellida. Oh! don't speak of it! Don't think of it! There is no help in
this for me. I feel that so well. I can't shake it off--not even there.
Wangel. What, dear?--What do you really mean?
Ellida. I mean the horror of it, this incomprehensible power over the
mind.
Wangel. But you have shaken it off--long since--when you broke with him.
Why, all this is long past now.
Ellida (springing up). No; that it is not--it is not!
Wangel. Not past?
Ellida. No, Wangel, it is not past; and I fear it never will be--never,
in all our life.
Wangel (in a pained voice). Do you mean to say that in your innermost
heart you have never been able to forget this strange man?
Ellida. I had forgotten him; but then it was as if he had suddenly come
back again.
Wangel. How long ago is that?
Ellida. It's about three years ago, now, or a little longer. It was just
when I expected the child.
Wangel. Ah! at that time? Yes, Ellida--now I begin to understand many
things.
Ellida. You are mistaken, dear. What has come to me? Oh! I believe
nothing on earth will ever make it clear.
Wangel (looking sadly at her). Only to think that all these three years
you have cared for another man. Cared for another. Not for me--but for
another!
Ellida. Oh! you are so utterly mistaken! I care for no one but you.
Wangel (in a subdued voice). Why, then, in all this time have you not
lived with me as my wife?
Ellida. Because of the horror that comes from the strange man.
Wangel. The horror?
Ellida. Yes, the horror. A horror so terrible--such as only the sea
could hold. For now you shall hear, Wangel.
(The young townsfolk come back, bow, and pass out to the right. Together
with them come ARNHOLM, BOLETTE, HILDE, and LYNGSTRAND.)
Bolette (as she passes by). Well, are you still walking about up here?
