    [A knock at the folding door.  BORKMAN hears it, looks rapidly
        towards the door, but says nothing.
    [In a little there comes another knock, this time louder.
BORKMAN.
  [Standing beside the writing-table with his left hand resting
upon it, and his right thrust in the breast of his coat.]  Come
in!
    [VILHELM FOLDAL comes softly into the room.  He is a bent
        and worn man with mild blue eyes and long, thin grey hair
        straggling down over his coat collar.  He has a portfolio
        under his arm, a soft felt hat, and large horn spectacles,
        which he pushes up over his forehead.
BORKMAN.
  [Changes his attitude and looks at FOLDAL with a half
disappointed, half pleased expression.]  Oh, is it only you?
FOLDAL.
  Good evening, John Gabriel.  Yes, you see it is me.
BORKMAN.
  [With a stern glance.]  I must say you are rather a late visitor.
FOLDAL.
  Well, you know, it's a good bit of a way, especially when you
have to trudge it on foot.
BORKMAN.
  But why do you always walk, Vilhelm?  The tramway passes your
door.
FOLDAL.
  It's better for you to walk--and then you always save twopence.
Well, has Frida been playing to you lately?
BORKMAN.
  She has just this moment gone.  Did you not meet her outside?
FOLDAL.
  No, I have seen nothing of her for a long time; not since she
went to live with this Mrs. Wilton.
BORKMAN.
  [Seating himself on the sofa and waving his hand toward a chair.]
You may sit down, Vilhelm.
FOLDAL.
  [Seating himself on the edge of a chair.]  Many thanks.  [Looks
mournfully at him.]  You can't think how lonely I feel since Frida
left home.
BORKMAN.
  Oh, come--you have plenty left.
FOLDAL.
  Yes, God knows I have--five of them.  But Frida was the only one
who at all understood me.  [Shaking his head sadly.]  The others
don't understand me a bit.
BORKMAN.
  [Gloomily, gazing straight before him, and drumming on the
table with his fingers.]  No, that's just it.  That is the curse
we exceptional, chosen people have to bear.  The common herd--
the average man and woman--they do not understand us, Vilhelm.
FOLDAL.
  [With resignation.]  If it were only the lack of understanding--
with a little patience, one could manage to wait for that awhile
yet.  [His voice choked with tears.]  But there is something
still bitterer.
BORKMAN.
  [Vehemently.]  There is nothing bitterer than that.
FOLDAL.
  Yes, there is, John Gabriel.  I have gone through a domestic
scene to-night--just before I started.
BORKMAN.
  Indeed?  What about?
FOLDAL.
  [With an outburst.]  My people at home--they despise me.
BORKMAN.
  [Indignantly.]  Despise----?
FOLDAL.
  [Wiping his eyes.]  I have long known it; but to-day it came
out unmistakably.
BORKMAN.
  [After a short silence.]  You made an unwise choice, I fear,
when you married.
FOLDAL.
  I had practically no choice in the matter.  And, you see, one
feels a need for companionship as one begins to get on in years.
And so crushed as I then was--so utterly broken down----
