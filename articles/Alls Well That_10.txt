LAFEU.
In a most weak,--
PAROLLES.
And debile minister, great power, great transcendence: which
should, indeed, give us a further use to be made than alone
the recov'ry of the king, as to be,--
LAFEU.
Generally thankful.
PAROLLES.
I would have said it; you say well. Here comes the king.
[Enter KING, HELENA, and Attendants.]
LAFEU.
Lustic, as the Dutchman says: I'll like a maid the better, whilst
I have a tooth in my head: why, he's able to lead her a coranto.
PAROLLES.
'Mort du vinaigre!' is not this Helen?
LAFEU.
'Fore God, I think so.
KING.
Go, call before me all the lords in court.--
[Exit an Attendant.]
Sit, my preserver, by thy patient's side;
And with this healthful hand, whose banish'd sense
Thou has repeal'd, a second time receive
The confirmation of my promis'd gift,
Which but attends thy naming.
[Enter severaol Lords.]
Fair maid, send forth thine eye: this youthful parcel
Of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing,
O'er whom both sovereign power and father's voice
I have to use: thy frank election make;
Thou hast power to choose, and they none to forsake.
HELENA.
To each of you one fair and virtuous mistress
Fall, when love please!--marry, to each, but one!
LAFEU.
I'd give bay Curtal and his furniture,
My mouth no more were broken than these boys',
And writ as little beard.
KING.
Peruse them well:
Not one of those but had a noble father.
HELENA.
Gentlemen,
Heaven hath through me restor'd the king to health.
ALL.
We understand it, and thank heaven for you.
HELENA.
I am a simple maid, and therein wealthiest
That I protest I simply am a maid.--
Please it, your majesty, I have done already:
The blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me--
'We blush that thou shouldst choose; but, be refus'd,
Let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever;
We'll ne'er come there again.'
KING.
Make choice; and, see:
Who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me.
HELENA.
Now, Dian, from thy altar do I fly,
And to imperial Love, that god most high,
Do my sighs stream.--Sir, will you hear my suit?
FIRST LORD.
And grant it.
HELENA.
Thanks, sir; all the rest is mute.
LAFEU.
I had rather be in this choice than throw ames-ace for my life.
HELENA.
The honour, sir, that flames in your fair eyes,
Before I speak, too threateningly replies:
Love make your fortunes twenty times above
Her that so wishes, and her humble love!
SECOND LORD.
No better, if you please.
HELENA.
My wish receive,
Which great Love grant; and so I take my leave.
LAFEU.
Do all they deny her? An they were sons of mine I'd have them
whipped; or I would send them to the Turk to make eunuchs of.
HELENA.
[To third Lord.] Be not afraid that I your hand should take;
I'll never do you wrong for your own sake:
Blessing upon your vows! and in your bed
Find fairer fortune, if you ever wed!
