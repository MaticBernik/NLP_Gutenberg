MRS. CHEVELEY.  What a charming house you have, Lady Chiltern!  I have
spent a delightful evening.  It has been so interesting getting to know
your husband.
LADY CHILTERN.  Why did you wish to meet my husband, Mrs. Cheveley?
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Oh, I will tell you.  I wanted to interest him in this
Argentine Canal scheme, of which I dare say you have heard.  And I found
him most susceptible,--susceptible to reason, I mean.  A rare thing in a
man.  I converted him in ten minutes.  He is going to make a speech in
the House to-morrow night in favour of the idea.  We must go to the
Ladies' Gallery and hear him!  It will be a great occasion!
LADY CHILTERN.  There must be some mistake.  That scheme could never have
my husband's support.
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Oh, I assure you it's all settled.  I don't regret my
tedious journey from Vienna now.  It has been a great success.  But, of
course, for the next twenty-four hours the whole thing is a dead secret.
LADY CHILTERN.  [_Gently_.]  A secret?  Between whom?
MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_With a flash of amusement in her eyes_.]  Between your
husband and myself.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Entering_.]  Your carriage is here, Mrs.
Cheveley!
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Thanks!  Good evening, Lady Chiltern!  Good-night, Lord
Goring!  I am at Claridge's.  Don't you think you might leave a card?
LORD GORING.  If you wish it, Mrs. Cheveley!
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Oh, don't be so solemn about it, or I shall be obliged to
leave a card on you.  In England I suppose that would hardly be
considered en regle.  Abroad, we are more civilised.  Will you see me
down, Sir Robert?  Now that we have both the same interests at heart we
shall be great friends, I hope!
[_Sails out on_ SIR ROBERT CHILTERN'S _arm_.  LADY CHILTERN _goes to the
top of the staircase and looks down at them as they descend_.  _Her
expression is troubled_.  _After a little time she is joined by some of
the guests_, _and passes with them into another reception-room_.]
MABEL CHILTERN.  What a horrid woman!
LORD GORING.  You should go to bed, Miss Mabel.
MABEL CHILTERN.  Lord Goring!
LORD GORING.  My father told me to go to bed an hour ago.  I don't see
why I shouldn't give you the same advice.  I always pass on good advice.
It is the only thing to do with it.  It is never of any use to oneself.
MABEL CHILTERN.  Lord Goring, you are always ordering me out of the room.
I think it most courageous of you.  Especially as I am not going to bed
for hours.  [_Goes over to the sofa_.]  You can come and sit down if you
like, and talk about anything in the world, except the Royal Academy,
Mrs. Cheveley, or novels in Scotch dialect.  They are not improving
subjects.  [_Catches sight of something that is lying on the sofa half
hidden by the cushion_.]  What is this?  Some one has dropped a diamond
brooch!  Quite beautiful, isn't it?  [_Shows it to him_.]  I wish it was
mine, but Gertrude won't let me wear anything but pearls, and I am
thoroughly sick of pearls.  They make one look so plain, so good and so
intellectual.  I wonder whom the brooch belongs to.
