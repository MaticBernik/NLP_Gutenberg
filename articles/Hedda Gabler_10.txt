What do you mean?
HEDDA.
Could you not see that I wanted him to go?
MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes, to write the letter--
HEDDA.
And that I might speak to you alone.
MRS. ELVSTED.
[Confused.] About the same thing?
HEDDA.
Precisely.
MRS. ELVSTED.
[Apprehensively.] But there is nothing more, Mrs. Tesman! Absolutely
nothing!
HEDDA.
Oh yes, but there is. There is a great deal more--I can see that. Sit
here--and we'll have a cosy, confidential chat.
   [She forces MRS. ELVSTED to sit in the easy-chair beside the
       stove, and seats herself on one of the footstools.
MRS. ELVSTED.
[Anxiously, looking at her watch.] But, my dear Mrs. Tesman--I was
really on the point of going.
HEDDA.
Oh, you can't be in such a hurry.--Well? Now tell me something about
your life at home.
MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh, that is just what I care least to speak about.
HEDDA.
But to me, dear--? Why, weren't we schoolfellows?
MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes, but you were in the class above me. Oh, how dreadfully afraid of
you I was then!
HEDDA.
Afraid of me?
MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes, dreadfully. For when we met on the stairs you used always to pull
my hair.
HEDDA.
Did I, really?
MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes, and once you said you would burn it off my head.
HEDDA.
Oh that was all nonsense, of course.
MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes, but I was so silly in those days.--And since then, too--we have
drifted so far--far apart from each other. Our circles have been so
entirely different.
HEDDA.
Well then, we must try to drift together again. Now listen. At school
we said _du_(4) to each other; and we called each other by our Christian
names--
MRS. ELVSTED.
No, I am sure you must be mistaken.
HEDDA.
No, not at all! I can remember quite distinctly. So now we are going to
renew our old friendship. [Draws the footstool closer to MRS. ELVSTED.]
There now! [Kisses her cheek.] You must say _du_ to me and call me
Hedda.
MRS. ELVSTED.
[Presses and pats her hands.] Oh, how good and kind you are! I am not
used to such kindness.
HEDDA.
There, there, there! And I shall say _du_ to you, as in the old days,
and call you my dear Thora.
MRS. ELVSTED.
My name is Thea.(5)
HEDDA.
Why, of course! I meant Thea. [Looks at her compassionately.] So you are
not accustomed to goodness and kindness, Thea? Not in your own home?
MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh, if I only had a home! But I haven't any; I have never had a home.
HEDDA.
[Looks at her for a moment.] I almost suspected as much.
MRS. ELVSTED.
[Gazing helplessly before her.] Yes--yes--yes.
HEDDA.
I don't quite remember--was it not as housekeeper that you first went to
Mr. Elvsted's?
MRS. ELVSTED.
I really went as governess. But his wife--his late wife--was an
invalid,--and rarely left her room. So I had to look after the
housekeeping as well.
HEDDA.
And then--at last--you became mistress of the house.
MRS. ELVSTED.
