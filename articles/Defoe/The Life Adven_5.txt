I was now to enter upon a part of independent life, a thing I was indeed
very ill prepared to manage, for I was perfectly loose and dissolute
in my behaviour, bold and wicked while I was under government, and now
perfectly unfit to be trusted with liberty, for I was as ripe for any
villainy as a young fellow that had no solid thought ever placed in his
mind could be supposed to be. Education, as you have heard, I had none;
and all the little scenes of life I had passed through had been full
of dangers and desperate circumstances; but I was either so young or so
stupid, that I escaped the grief and anxiety of them, for want of having
a sense of their tendency and consequences.
This thoughtless, unconcerned temper had one felicity indeed in it, that
it made me daring and ready for doing any mischief, and kept off the
sorrow which otherwise ought to have attended me when I fell into any
mischief; that this stupidity was instead of a happiness to me, for it
left my thoughts free to act upon means of escape and deliverance in my
distress, however great it might be; whereas my companions in the misery
were so sunk by their fear and grief, that they abandoned themselves to
the misery of their condition, and gave over all thought but of their
perishing and starving, being devoured by wild beasts, murdered, and
perhaps eaten by cannibals, and the like.
I was but a young fellow, about seventeen or eighteen; but hearing what
was to be my fate, I received it with no appearance of discouragement;
but I asked what my master said to it, and being told that he had used
his utmost interest to save me, but the captain had answered I should
either go on shore or be hanged on board, which he pleased, I then gave
over all hope of being received again. I was not very thankful in my
thoughts to my master for his soliciting the captain for me, because I
knew that what he did was not in kindness to me so much as in kindness
to himself; I mean, to preserve the wages which he got for me, which
amounted to above six dollars a month, including what the captain
allowed him for my particular service to him.
When I understood that my master was so apparently kind, I asked if I
might not be admitted to speak with him, and they told me I might, if my
master would come down to me, but I could not be allowed to come up to
him; so then I desired my master might be spoke to to come to me, and he
accordingly came to me. I fell on my knees to him, and begged he would
forgive me what I had done to displease him; and indeed the resolution
I had taken to murder him lay with some horror upon my mind just at
that time, so that I was once just a-going to confess it, and beg him
to forgive me, but I kept it in. He told me he had done all he could to
obtain my pardon of the captain, but could not and he knew no way for me
but to have patience, and submit to my fate; and if they came to speak
with any ship of their nation at the Cape, he would endeavour to have
them stand in, and fetch us off again, if we might be found.
