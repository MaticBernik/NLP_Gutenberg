_April_ 22. When I began to put my resolutions in practice, I was stopt
for want of tools and instruments to work with. Most of my axes and
hatchets were useless, occasioned by cutting the hard timber that grew
on the island. It took me up a full week to make my grind-stone of use
to me, and at last I found out a way to turn it about with my foot, by
help of a wheel and a string.
_April_ 28--29. These days were spent in grinding my tools.
_April_ 30. My bread falling short, I allowed myself but one biscuit a
day.
_May_ 1. As I walked along the sea shore I found a barrel of gunpowder,
and several pieces of the wreck, the sea had flung up. Having secured
those, I made to the ship, whose stern was torn off, and washed a great
distance ashore; but the rest lay in the sands. This I suppose was
occasioned by the earthquake. I now resolved to keep my old place of
abode; and also to go to the ship that day, but then found it
impossible.
_May_ 3. This day I went on board, and with my saw sawed off one of the
beams, which kept her quarter-deck. I then cleared the sand till flood.
_May_ 4. I caught some fish, but they were not wholesome, The same day I
also catched a young dolphin.
_May 5._ 'This day I also repaired to the wreck, and sawed another
piece of timber, and when the flood came, I made a float of three great
planks, which were driven ashore by the tide.
_May 6, 7, 8, 9._ These days I brought off the iron bolts, opened the
deck with the iron crow, and carried two planks to land, having made a
way into the very middle of the wreck.
_May 10, 11, 12, 13, 14._ All this time I spent in bringing off great
quantities of iron and timber.
_May 15._ Took with me two hatchets on purpose to cut off some lead from
the roll, but all in vain, for it lay too low under water.
_May 16._ I omitted going to the wreck this day, for employing myself in
looking for pigeons, I outstaid my time.
_May 17._ I perceived several pieces of the wreck driven ashore, which I
found belonged to the head of the ship.
_May 24._ To this day I worked on the wreck, and with great difficulty
loosened some things so much with the crow, that at the first flowing
tide several casks floated out, and many of the seamen's chests, yet
that day nothing came to land but pieces of timber, and a hogshead which
had some Brazil pork in it. I continued working to the 15th of June;
(except necessary times for food and rest) and had I known how to have
built a boat, I had timber and planks enough; I had also near 100 weight
of sheet lead.
_June 16._ As I was wandering towards the sea-side, I found a large
tortoise or turtle, being the first I had seen on the island, though, as
I afterwards found, there were many on the other side of it.
