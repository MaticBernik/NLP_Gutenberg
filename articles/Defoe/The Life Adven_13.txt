This moidore I ventured to show, that they might not despise me too much
for adding too little to the store, and that they might not pretend to
search me; and they were very civil to me, upon the presumption that I
had been so faithful to them as not to conceal anything from them.
But our money did us little service, for the people neither knew
the value or the use of it, nor could they justly rate the gold in
proportion with the silver; so that all our money, which was not much
when it was all put together, would go but a little way with us, that is
to say, to buy us provisions.
Our next consideration was to get away from this cursed place, and
whither to go. When my opinion came to be asked, I told them I would
leave that all to them, and I told them I had rather they would let me
go into the woods to get them some provisions, than consult with me, for
I would agree to whatever they did; but they would not agree to that,
for they would not consent that any of us should go into the woods
alone; for though we had yet seen no lions or tigers in the woods, we
were assured there were many in the island, besides other creatures
as dangerous, and perhaps worse, as we afterwards found by our own
experience.
We had many adventures in the woods, for our provisions, and often met
with wild and terrible beasts, which we could not call by their names;
but as they were, like us, seeking their prey, but were themselves good
for nothing, so we disturbed them as little as possible.
Our consultations concerning our escape from this place, which, as I
have said, we were now upon, ended in this only, that as we had two
carpenters among us, and that they had tools almost of all sorts with
them, we should try to build us a boat to go off to sea with, and that
then, perhaps, we might find our way back to Goa, or land on some more
proper place to make our escape. The counsels of this assembly were
not of great moment, yet as they seem to be introductory of many more
remarkable adventures which happened under my conduct hereabouts many
years after, I think this miniature of my future enterprises may not be
unpleasant to relate.
To the building of a boat I made no objection, and away they went to
work immediately; but as they went on, great difficulties occurred,
such as the want of saws to cut our plank; nails, bolts, and spikes, to
fasten the timbers; hemp, pitch, and tar, to caulk and pay her seams,
and the like. At length, one of the company proposed that, instead of
building a bark or sloop, or shallop, or whatever they would call
it, which they found was so difficult, they would rather make a large
periagua, or canoe, which might be done with great ease.
