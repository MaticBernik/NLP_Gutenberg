_D._ No, _you Dog_, I am not inconsistent at all, and if I had the
ordering of you, I'd make you sensible of it; I'd make you think your
self damn'd for want of _a Devil_.
_Gr._ That's like one of _your Grace_'s paradoxes, such as when you
swore _by God_ that you did not believe there was any such thing as _a
God_, or _Devil_; so you swear by _nothing_, and damn me to _no where_.
_D._ You are a critical Dog, who taught you to believe these solemn
trifles? who taught you to say there is a GOD?
_Gr._ Nay, I had a better school-master than my _Lord Duke_.
_D._ Why, who was your school-master pray?
_Gr._ _The Devil_, and't please your _Grace_.
_D._ The Devil! _the Devil he did?_ what you're going to quote
Scripture, are you? Prithee don't tell me of _Scripture_, I know what
you mean, _the Devils believe and tremble_; why then I have the
whip-hand of _the Devil_, for I hate trembling; and I am deliver'd from
it effectually, for I never believed any thing of it, and therefore I
don't tremble.
_Gr._ And there, indeed, I am a wickeder creature than the _Devil_, or
even than my _Lord Duke_, for I believe, and yet don't tremble neither.
_D._ Nay, if you are come to your penitentials I have done with you.
_Gr._ And I think I must have done with my _Lord Duke_, for the same
reason.
_D._ _Ay, ay_, pray do, I'll go and enjoy my self; I won't throw away
the pleasure of my life, I know the consequence of it.
_Gr._ And I'll go and reform my self, else I know the consequence too.
This short Dialogue happen'd between two men of quality, and both men of
wit too; and the effect was, that the Lord brought the reality of _the
Devil_ into the question, and the debate brought the profligate to be a
penitent; so in short, _the Devil_ was made a preacher of repentance.
The Truth is, _God_ and _the Devil_, however opposite in their nature,
and remote from one another in their place of abiding, seem to stand
pretty much upon a level in our faith: For as to our believing the
reality of their existence, he that denies one, generally denies both;
and he that believes one, necessarily believes both.
Very few, if any of those who believe there is a GOD, and acknowledge
the debt of homage which mankind owes to the supreme Governor of the
World, doubt the existence of _the Devil_, except here and there one,
whom we call practical Atheists; and 'tis the character of an Atheist,
if there is such a creature on Earth, that like my _Lord Duke_, he
believes neither GOD or _Devil_.
As the belief of both these stands upon a level, and that GOD and the
_Devil_ seem to have an equal share in our faith, so the evidence of
their existence seems to stand upon a level too, in many things; and as
they are known by their Works in the same particular cases, so they are
discover'd after the same manner of demonstration.
