This is hinted here only to inform the Reader, That this Engine is
the safest Passage that ever was found out; and that saving that
one time, it never miscarried; nor if the common Order of things
be observed, cannot Miscarry; for the good Feathers are always
Negatives, when any precipitant Motion is felt, and immediately
suppress it by their number; and these Negative Feathers are indeed
the Travellers safety; the other are always upon the flutter, and
upon every occasion hey for the Moon, up in the Clouds presently; but
these Negative Feathers are never for going up, but when there is
occasion for it; and from hence these fluttering fermented Feathers
were called by the Antients High-flying Feathers, and the blustering
things seem'd proud of the Name.
But to come to their general Character, the Feathers, speaking of
them all together, are generally very Comely, Strong, Large,
Beautiful things, their Quills or Heads well fixt, and the Cavities
fill'd with a solid substantial Matter, which tho' it is full of
Spirit, has a great deal of Temperament, and full of suitable
well-dispos'd Powers, to the Operation for which they are design'd.
These placed, as I Noted before, in an extended Form like two great
Wings, and operated by that sublime Flame; which being concealed in
proper Receptacles, obtains its vent at the Cavities appointed, are
supplied from thence with Life and Motion; and as Fire it fell, in
the Opinion of some Learned Men, is nothing but Motion, and Motion
tends to Fire: It can no more be a Wonder, if exalted in the Center
of this famous Engine, a whole Nation should be carried up to the
World in the Moon.
'Tis true, this Engine is frequently assaulted with fierce Winds, and
furious Storms, which sometimes drive it a great way out of its way;
and indeed, considering the length of the Passage, and the various
Regions it goes through, it would be strange if it should meet with
no Obstructions: These are oblique Gales, and cannot be said to blow
from any of the Thirty-two Points, but Retrograde and Thwart: Some of
these are call'd in their Language, Pensionazima, which is as much
as to say, being Interpreted, a Court-breeze; another sort of Wind,
which generally blows directly contrary to the Pensionazima, is
the Clamorio, or in English, a Country Gale; this is generally
Tempestuous, full of Gusts and Disgusts, Squauls and sudden Blasts,
not without claps of Thunder, and not a little flashing of Heat and
Party-fires.
There are a great many other Internal Blasts, which proceed from the
Fire within, which sometimes not circulating right, breaks out in
little Gusts of Wind and Heat, and is apt to indanger setting Fire to
the Feathers, and this is more or less dangerous, according as among
which of the Feathers it happens; for some of the Feathers are more
apt to take Fire than others, as their Quills or Heads are more or
less full of that solid Matter mention'd before.
