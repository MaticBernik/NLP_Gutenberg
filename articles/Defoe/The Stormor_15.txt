And this I particularly noted as to Time, _Wednesday, Nov._ the 24_th_
was a calm fine Day as at that time of Year shall be seen; till above
Four a Clock, when it began to be Cloudy, and the Wind rose of a sudden,
and in half an Hours Time it blew a Storm. _Wednesday, Dec._ the 2_d._
it was very tempestuous all the Morning; at One a Clock the Wind abated,
the Sky clear'd, and by Four a Clock there was not a Breath of Wind.
Thus ended the Greatest and the Longest Storm that ever the World saw.
The Effects of this terrible Providence are the Subject of the ensuing
Chapter; and I close this with a Pastoral Poem sent us among the
Accounts of the Storm from a very ingenious Author, and desir'd to be
publish'd in this Account.
    _A PASTORAL, Occasion'd by the Late Violent Storm_
      _Damon, Melibaeus._
    DAM.
    _Walking alone by pleasant Isis side
    Where the two Streams their wanton course divide,
    And gently forward in soft Murmurs glide;
    Pensive and sad I_ Melibaeus _meet,
    And thus the melancholy Shepherd greet.
      Kind Swain, what Cloud dares overcast your brow,
    Bright as the Skies o're happy_ Nile _till now!
    Does_ Chloe _prove unkind, or some new Fair?_
    MEL.
    _No_ Damon, _mine's a publick, nobler, Care;
    Such in which you and all the World must share.        10
    One Friend may mollifie another's Grief,
    But publick Loss admits of no relief._
    DAM.
    _I guess your Cause: O you that use to sing
    Of Beauty's Charms and the Delights of Spring;
    Now change your Note, and let your Lute rehearse
    The dismal Tale in melancholy Verse._
    MEL.
    _Prepare then, lovely Swain; prepare to hear,
    The worst Report that ever reach'd your Ear.
      My_ Bower _you know, hard by yon shady Grove,
    A fit Recess for_ Damon_'s pensive Love:               20
    As there dissolv'd I in sweet Slumbers lay,
    Tir'd with the Toils of the precedent Day,
    The blust'ring Winds disturb my kind Repose,
    Till frightned with the threatning Blasts, I rose.
    But O, what havock did the Day disclose!
    Those charming Willows which on_ Cherwel_'s banks
    Flourish'd, and thriv'd, and grew in evener ranks
    Than those which follow'd the Divine Command
    Of_ Orpheus _Lyre, or sweet_ Amphion_'s Hand,
    By hundreds fall, while hardly twenty stand.           30
    The stately Oaks which reach'd the azure Sky,
    And kiss'd the very Clouds, now prostrate lie.
    Long a huge Pine did with the Winds contend;
    This way, and that, his reeling Trunk they bend,
    Till forc'd at last to yield, with hideous Sound
    He falls, and all the Country feels the Wound.
      Nor was the God of Winds content with these;
    Such humble Victims can't his Wrath appease:
    The Rivers swell, not like the happy_ Nile,
    _To fatten, dew, and fructifie our_ Isle:              40
    _But like the_ Deluge, _by great Jove design'd
    To drown the Universe, and scourge Mankind.
    In vain the frighted Cattel climb so high,
    In vain for Refuge to the Hills they fly;
    The Waters know no Limits but the Sky.
    So now the bleating Flock exchange in vain,
    For barren Clifts, their dewy fertil Plain:
    In vain, their fatal Destiny to shun,
    From_ Severn_'s Banks to higher Grounds they run.
        Nor has the_ Navy _better Quarter found;           50
    There we've receiv'd our worst, our deepest Wound.
    The Billows swell, and haughty_ Neptune _raves,
    The Winds insulting o're th' impetuous Waves._
    Thetis _incens'd, rises with angry Frown,
    And once more threatens all the World to drown,
    And owns no Power, but_ England_'s and her own.
    Yet the_ AEolian _God dares vent his Rage;
    And ev'n the Sovereign of the Seas engage.
    What tho' the mighty_ Charles _of_ Spain_'s on board,
    The Winds obey none but their blust'ring Lord.         60
    Some Ships were stranded, some by Surges rent,
    Down with their Cargo to the bottom went.
    Th' absorbent Ocean could desire no more;
    So well regal'd he never was before.
    The hungry Fish could hardly wait the day,
    When the Sun's beams should chase the Storm away,
    But quickly seize with greedy Jaws their Prey._
