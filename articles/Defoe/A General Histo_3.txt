THE HISTORY OF THE PYRATES.
INTRODUCTION.
AS the Pyrates in the _West-Indies_ have been so formidable and
numerous, that they have interrupted the Trade of _Europe_ into those
Parts; and our _English_ Merchants, in particular, have suffered more by
their Depredations, than by the united Force of _France_ and _Spain_, in
the late War: We do not doubt but the World will be curious to know the
Original and Progress of these Desperadoes, who were the Terror of the
trading Part of the World.
But before we enter upon their particular History, it will not be amiss, by
way of Introduction, to shew, by some Examples drawn from History, the
great Mischief and Danger which threaten Kingdoms and Commonwealths, from
the Increase of these sort of Robbers; when either by the Troubles of
particular Times, or the Neglect of Governments, they are not crush'd
before they gather Strength.
