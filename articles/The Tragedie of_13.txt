[Footnote 3: --_but_ to the moon--which can show it so little.]
[Footnote 4: Opened but not closed quotations in the _Quarto_.]
[Footnote 5: The French _bouton_ is also both _button_ and _bud_.]
[Footnote 6: 'Inclination is enough to have to deal with, let alone
added temptation.' Like his father, Laertes is wise for another--a man
of maxims, not behaviour. His morality is in his intellect and for
self-ends, not in his will, and for the sake of truth and
righteousness.]
[Footnote 7: _1st Q_.
    But my deere brother, do not you
    Like to a cunning Sophister,
    Teach me the path and ready way to heauen,
    While you forgetting what is said to me,
    Your selfe, like to a carelesse libertine
    Doth giue his heart, his appetite at ful,
    And little recks how that his honour dies.
    'The primrose way to the everlasting bonfire.'
    --_Macbeth_, ii. 3:
    'The flowery way that leads to the broad gate and the great fire.'
    _All's Well_, iv. 5.]
[Footnote 8: 'heeds not his own counsel.']
[Footnote 9: Here in Quarto, _Enter Polonius._]
[Footnote 10: With the fitting arrogance and impertinence of a libertine
brother, he has read his sister a lecture on propriety of behaviour; but
when she gently suggests that what is good for her is good for him
too,--'Oh, fear me not!--I stay too long.']
[Footnote 11: 'A second leave-taking is a happy chance': the chance, or
occasion, because it is happy, smiles. It does not mean that occasion
smiles upon a second leave, but that, upon a second leave, occasion
smiles. There should be a comma after _smiles_.]
[Footnote 12: As many of Polonius' aphorismic utterances as are given in
the 1st Quarto have there inverted commas; but whether intended as
gleanings from books or as fruits of experience, the light they throw on
the character of him who speaks them is the same: they show it
altogether selfish. He is a man of the world, wise in his generation,
his principles the best of their bad sort. Of these his son is a fit
recipient and retailer, passing on to his sister their father's grand
doctrine of self-protection. But, wise in maxim, Polonius is foolish in
practice--not from senility, but from vanity.]

And these few Precepts in thy memory,[1]
See thou Character.[2] Giue thy thoughts no tongue,
                                                  [Sidenote: Looke thou]
Nor any vnproportion'd[3] thought his Act:
Be thou familiar; but by no meanes vulgar:[4]
The friends thou hast, and their adoption tride,[5]
                                               [Sidenote: Those friends]
Grapple them to thy Soule, with hoopes of Steele:       [Sidenote: unto]
But doe not dull thy palme, with entertainment
Of each vnhatch't, vnfledg'd Comrade.[6] Beware
                           [Sidenote: each new hatcht unfledgd courage,]
Of entrance to a quarrell: but being in
Bear't that th'opposed may beware of thee.
Giue euery man thine eare; but few thy voyce:      [Sidenote: thy eare,]
Take each mans censure[7]; but reserue thy Judgement;
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy;
But not exprest in fancie; rich, not gawdie:
For the Apparell oft proclaimes the man.
And they in France of the best ranck and station,
Are of a most select and generous[8] cheff in that.[10]
                                 [Sidenote: Or of a generous, chiefe[9]]
Neither a borrower, nor a lender be;             [Sidenote: lender boy,]
For lone oft loses both it selfe and friend:            [Sidenote: loue]
And borrowing duls the edge of Husbandry.[11]
                                                [Sidenote: dulleth edge]
This aboue all; to thine owne selfe be true:
And it must follow, as the Night the Day,
Thou canst not then be false to any man.[12]
Farewell: my Blessing season[13] this in thee.
