"We shall report our find to the City Council and both of us
will be rewarded."
And then we spoke. Our voice was hard and there was no mercy in
our voice. We said:
"We shall not report our find to the City Council. We shall not
report it to any men."
They raised their hands to their ears, for never had they heard
such words as these.
"International 4-8818," we asked, "will you report us to the
Council and see us lashed to death before your eyes?"
They stood straight [-all-] of a sudden and they answered:
"Rather would we die."
"Then," we said, "keep silent. This place is ours. This place
belongs to us, Equality 7-2521, and to
[-no-] {+not+} other men on earth.
And if ever we surrender it, we shall surrender our life with it
also."
Then we saw that [-they-] {+the+} eyes of International 4-8818 were full to
the lids with tears {+with tears+} they dared not [-drop.
They-] {+drop, they+}
whispered, and their voice trembled, so that their words lost all
shape:
"The will of the Council is above all things, for it is the will
of our brothers, which is holy. But if you wish it so, we shall
obey you. Rather shall we be evil with you than good with all our
brothers. May the Council have mercy upon both our hearts!"
Then we walked away together and back to the Home of the Street
Sweepers. And we walked in silence.
Thus did it come to pass that each night, when the stars are high
and the Street Sweepers sit in the City Theatre, we, Equality
7-2521, steal out and run through the darkness to our place. It
is easy to leave the Theatre; when the candles are blown [-out-] and the
Actors come onto the stage, no eyes can see us as we crawl under
our seat and under the cloth of the tent.  [-Later,-] {+Later+} it is easy to
steal through the shadows and fall in line next to International
4-8818, as the column leaves the Theatre. It is dark in the
streets and there are no men about, for no men may walk through
the City when they have no mission to walk there. Each night, we
run to the ravine, and we remove the stones [-which-] we have piled upon
the iron grill to hide it from [-the-] men. Each night, for three hours,
we are under the earth, alone.
We have stolen candles from the Home of the Street Sweepers, we
have stolen flints and knives and paper, and we have brought them
to this place. We have stolen glass vials and powders and acids
from the Home of the Scholars. Now we sit in the tunnel for three
hours each night and we study. We melt strange metals, and we mix
acids, and we cut open the bodies of the animals which we find in
the City Cesspool. We have built an oven of the bricks we
gathered in the streets. We burn the wood we find in the ravine.
The fire flickers in the oven and blue shadows dance upon the
walls, and there is no sound of men to disturb us.
