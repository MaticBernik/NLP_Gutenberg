WOLSEY.
Sir, you cannot.
I would your Grace would give us but an hour
Of private conference.
KING.
[To Norfolk and Suffolk.] We are busy; go.
NORFOLK.
[Aside to Suffolk.]  This priest has no pride in him?
SUFFOLK.
[Aside to Norfolk.]  Not to speak of.
I would not be so sick, though, for his place.
But this cannot continue.
NORFOLK.
[Aside to Suffolk.]  If it do,
I'll venture one have-at-him.
SUFFOLK.
[Aside to Norfolk.]  I another.
[Exeunt Norfolk and Suffolk.]
WOLSEY.
Your Grace has given a precedent of wisdom
Above all princes, in committing freely
Your scruple to the voice of Christendom.
Who can be angry now? What envy reach you?
The Spaniard, tied by blood and favour to her,
Must now confess, if they have any goodness,
The trial just and noble. All the clerks,
I mean the learned ones, in Christian kingdoms
Have their free voices. Rome, the nurse of judgement,
Invited by your noble self, hath sent
One general tongue unto us, this good man,
This just and learned priest, Cardinal Campeius,
Whom once more I present unto your Highness.
KING.
And once more in mine arms I bid him welcome,
And thank the holy conclave for their loves.
They have sent me such a man I would have wish'd for.
CAMPEIUS.
Your Grace must needs deserve all strangers' loves,
You are so noble. To your Highness' hand
I tender my commission; by whose virtue,
The court of Rome commanding--you, my Lord
Cardinal of York, are join'd with me their servant
In the unpartial judging of this business.
KING.
Two equal men. The Queen shall be acquainted
Forthwith for what you come. Where's Gardiner?
WOLSEY.
I know your Majesty has always lov'd her
So dear in heart not to deny her that
A woman of less place might ask by law,
Scholars allow'd freely to argue for her.
KING.
Ay, and the best she shall have; and my favour
To him that does best; God forbid else. Cardinal,
Prithee, call Gardiner to me, my new secretary.
I find him a fit fellow.
[Exit Wolsey.]
[Re-enter Wolsey, with Gardiner.]
WOLSEY.
[Aside to Gardiner.]
Give me your hand.  Much joy and favour to you;
You are the King's now.
GARDINER.
[Aside to Wolsey.]  But to be commanded
For ever by your Grace, whose hand has rais'd me.
KING.
Come hither, Gardiner.
[Walks and whispers.]
CAMPEIUS.
My Lord of York, was not one Doctor Pace
In this man's place before him?
WOLSEY.
Yes, he was.
CAMPEIUS.
Was he not held a learned man?
WOLSEY.
Yes, surely.
CAMPEIUS.
Believe me, there's an ill opinion spread then
Even of yourself, Lord Cardinal.
WOLSEY.
How! of me?
CAMPEIUS.
They will not stick to say you envi'd him,
And fearing he would rise, he was so virtuous,
Kept him a foreign man still; which so griev'd him
That he ran mad and died.
WOLSEY.
Heav'n's peace be with him!
That's Christian care enough. For living murmurers
There's places of rebuke. He was a fool,
For he would needs be virtuous.  That good fellow,
If I command him, follows my appointment;
I will have none so near else. Learn this, brother,
We live not to be grip'd by meaner persons.
