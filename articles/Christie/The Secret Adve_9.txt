Thats odd.
Isnt it? Come up with me, and lets try again.
Tommy followed her. As they passed the third floor landing a young clerk
came out of an office. He hesitated a moment, then addressed himself to
Tuppence.
Were you wanting the Esthonia Glassware?
Yes, please.
Its closed down. Since yesterday afternoon. Company being wound up,
they say. Not that Ive ever heard of it myself. But anyway the office
is to let.
Th--thank you, faltered Tuppence. I suppose you dont know Mr.
Whittingtons address?
Afraid I dont. They left rather suddenly.
Thank you very much, said Tommy. Come on, Tuppence.
They descended to the street again where they gazed at one another
blankly.
Thats torn it, said Tommy at length.
And I never suspected it, wailed Tuppence.
Cheer up, old thing, it cant be helped.
Cant it, though! Tuppences little chin shot out defiantly. Do you
think this is the end? If so, youre wrong. Its just the beginning!
The beginning of what?
Of our adventure! Tommy, dont you see, if they are scared enough to
run away like this, it shows that there must be a lot in this Jane Finn
business! Well, well get to the bottom of it. Well run them down!
Well be sleuths in earnest!
Yes, but theres no one left to sleuth.
No, thats why well have to start all over again. Lend me that bit of
pencil. Thanks. Wait a minute--dont interrupt. There! Tuppence handed
back the pencil, and surveyed the piece of paper on which she had
written with a satisfied eye:
Whats that?
Advertisement.
Youre not going to put that thing in after all?
No, its a different one. She handed him the slip of paper.
Tommy read the words on it aloud:
WANTED, any information respecting Jane Finn. Apply Y. A.
CHAPTER IV. WHO IS JANE FINN?
THE next day passed slowly. It was necessary to curtail expenditure.
Carefully husbanded, forty pounds will last a long time. Luckily the
weather was fine, and walking is cheap, dictated Tuppence. An outlying
picture house provided them with recreation for the evening.
The day of disillusionment had been a Wednesday. On Thursday the
advertisement had duly appeared. On Friday letters might be expected to
arrive at Tommys rooms.
He had been bound by an honourable promise not to open any such letters
if they did arrive, but to repair to the National Gallery, where his
colleague would meet him at ten oclock.
Tuppence was first at the rendezvous. She ensconced herself on a red
velvet seat, and gazed at the Turners with unseeing eyes until she saw
the familiar figure enter the room.
Well?
Well, returned Mr. Beresford provokingly. Which is your favourite
picture?
Dont be a wretch. Arent there _any_ answers?
Tommy shook his head with a deep and somewhat overacted melancholy.
I didnt want to disappoint you, old thing, by telling you right off.
Its too bad. Good money wasted. He sighed. Still, there it is. The
advertisement has appeared, and--there are only two answers!
