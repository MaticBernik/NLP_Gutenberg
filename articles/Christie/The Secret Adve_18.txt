The energy of Mr. Hersheimmer was tremendous. They bowed before it.
But say now, he ended, youre not after her for anything? Contempt of
court, or something British? A proud-spirited young American girl might
find your rules and regulations in war time rather irksome, and get up
against it. If thats the case, and theres such a thing as graft in
this country, Ill buy her off.
Tuppence reassured him.
Thats good. Then we can work together. What about some lunch? Shall we
have it up here, or go down to the restaurant?
Tuppence expressed a preference for the latter, and Julius bowed to her
decision.
Oysters had just given place to Sole Colbert when a card was brought to
Hersheimmer.
Inspector Japp, C.I.D. Scotland Yard again. Another man this time. What
does he expect I can tell him that I didnt tell the first chap? I hope
they havent lost that photograph. That Western photographers place was
burned down and all his negatives destroyed--this is the only copy in
existence. I got it from the principal of the college there.
An unformulated dread swept over Tuppence.
You--you dont know the name of the man who came this morning?
Yes, I do. No, I dont. Half a second. It was on his card. Oh, I know!
Inspector Brown. Quiet, unassuming sort of chap.
CHAPTER VI. A PLAN OF CAMPAIGN
A veil might with profit be drawn over the events of the next half-hour.
Suffice it to say that no such person as Inspector Brown was known to
Scotland Yard. The photograph of Jane Finn, which would have been of
the utmost value to the police in tracing her, was lost beyond recovery.
Once again Mr. Brown had triumphed.
The immediate result of this set-back was to effect a _rapprochement_
between Julius Hersheimmer and the Young Adventurers. All barriers went
down with a crash, and Tommy and Tuppence felt they had known the young
American all their lives. They abandoned the discreet reticence of
private inquiry agents, and revealed to him the whole history of
the joint venture, whereat the young man declared himself tickled to
death.
He turned to Tuppence at the close of the narration.
Ive always had a kind of idea that English girls were just a mite
moss-grown. Old-fashioned and sweet, you know, but scared to move round
without a footman or a maiden aunt. I guess Im a bit behind the times!
The upshot of these confidential relations was that Tommy and Tuppence
took up their abode forthwith at the _Ritz_, in order, as Tuppence put
it, to keep in touch with Jane Finns only living relation. And put
like that, she added confidentially to Tommy, nobody could boggle at
the expense!
Nobody did, which was the great thing.
And now, said the young lady on the morning after their installation,
to work!
Mr. Beresford put down the _Daily Mail_, which he was reading, and
applauded with somewhat unnecessary vigour. He was politely requested by
his colleague not to be an ass.
