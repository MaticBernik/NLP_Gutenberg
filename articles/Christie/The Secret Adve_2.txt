Another inference forced itself into Tuppences mind:
You followed me here?
I took that liberty.
And in what way do you think you could be of use to me?
The man took a card from his pocket and handed it to her with a bow.
Tuppence took it and scrutinized it carefully. It bore the inscription,
Mr. Edward Whittington. Below the name were the words Esthonia
Glassware Co., and the address of a city office. Mr. Whittington spoke
again:
If you will call upon me to-morrow morning at eleven oclock, I will
lay the details of my proposition before you.
At eleven oclock? said Tuppence doubtfully.
At eleven oclock.
Tuppence made up her mind.
Very well. Ill be there.
Thank you. Good evening.
He raised his hat with a flourish, and walked away. Tuppence remained
for some minutes gazing after him. Then she gave a curious movement of
her shoulders, rather as a terrier shakes himself.
The adventures have begun, she murmured to herself. What does he want
me to do, I wonder? Theres something about you, Mr. Whittington, that I
dont like at all. But, on the other hand, Im not the least bit afraid
of you. And as Ive said before, and shall doubtless say again, little
Tuppence can look after herself, thank you!
And with a short, sharp nod of her head she walked briskly onward. As a
result of further meditations, however, she turned aside from the direct
route and entered a post office. There she pondered for some moments,
a telegraph form in her hand. The thought of a possible five shillings
spent unnecessarily spurred her to action, and she decided to risk the
waste of ninepence.
Disdaining the spiky pen and thick, black treacle which a beneficent
Government had provided, Tuppence drew out Tommys pencil which she had
retained and wrote rapidly: Dont put in advertisement. Will explain
to-morrow. She addressed it to Tommy at his club, from which in one
short month he would have to resign, unless a kindly fortune permitted
him to renew his subscription.
It may catch him, she murmured. Anyway, its worth trying.
After handing it over the counter she set out briskly for home, stopping
at a bakers to buy three penny-worth of new buns.
Later, in her tiny cubicle at the top of the house she munched buns and
reflected on the future. What was the Esthonia Glassware Co., and what
earthly need could it have for her services? A pleasurable thrill of
excitement made Tuppence tingle. At any rate, the country vicarage had
retreated into the background again. The morrow held possibilities.
It was a long time before Tuppence went to sleep that night, and, when
at length she did, she dreamed that Mr. Whittington had set her to
washing up a pile of Esthonia Glassware, which bore an unaccountable
resemblance to hospital plates!
It wanted some five minutes to eleven when Tuppence reached the block
of buildings in which the offices of the Esthonia Glassware Co. were
situated. To arrive before the time would look over-eager. So Tuppence
decided to walk to the end of the street and back again. She did so. On
the stroke of eleven she plunged into the recesses of the building.
The Esthonia Glassware Co. was on the top floor. There was a lift, but
Tuppence chose to walk up.
