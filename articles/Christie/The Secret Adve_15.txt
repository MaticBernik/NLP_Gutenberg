Mr. Carter smiled more wearily than ever.
I believe in coincidences, you know, he said.
CHAPTER V. MR. JULIUS P. HERSHEIMMER
WELL, said Tuppence, recovering herself, it really seems as though it
were meant to be.
Carter nodded.
I know what you mean. Im superstitious myself. Luck, and all that sort
of thing. Fate seems to have chosen you out to be mixed up in this.
Tommy indulged in a chuckle.
My word! I dont wonder Whittington got the wind up when Tuppence
plumped out that name! I should have myself. But look here, sir, were
taking up an awful lot of your time. Have you any tips to give us before
we clear out?
I think not. My experts, working in stereotyped ways, have failed.
You will bring imagination and an open mind to the task. Dont be
discouraged if that too does not succeed. For one thing there is a
likelihood of the pace being forced.
Tuppence frowned uncomprehendingly.
When you had that interview with Whittington, they had time before
them. I have information that the big _coup_ was planned for early in
the new year. But the Government is contemplating legislative action
which will deal effectually with the strike menace. Theyll get wind of
it soon, if they havent already, and its possible that that may bring
things to a head. I hope it will myself. The less time they have to
mature their plans the better. Im just warning you that you havent
much time before you, and that you neednt be cast down if you fail.
Its not an easy proposition anyway. Thats all.
Tuppence rose.
I think we ought to be businesslike. What exactly can we count upon you
for, Mr. Carter? Mr. Carters lips twitched slightly, but he replied
succinctly: Funds within reason, detailed information on any point,
and _no official recognition_. I mean that if you get yourselves into
trouble with the police, I cant officially help you out of it. Youre
on your own.
Tuppence nodded sagely.
I quite understand that. Ill write out a list of the things I want to
know when Ive had time to think. Now--about money----
Yes, Miss Tuppence. Do you want to say how much?
Not exactly. Weve got plenty to go with for the present, but when we
want more----
It will be waiting for you.
Yes, but--Im sure I dont want to be rude about the Government if
youve got anything to do with it, but you know one really has the devil
of a time getting anything out of it! And if we have to fill up a blue
form and send it in, and then, after three months, they send us a green
one, and so on--well, that wont be much use, will it?
Mr. Carter laughed outright.
Dont worry, Miss Tuppence. You will send a personal demand to me here,
and the money, in notes, shall be sent by return of post. As to salary,
shall we say at the rate of three hundred a year? And an equal sum for
Mr. Beresford, of course.
