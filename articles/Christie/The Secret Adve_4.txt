One moment, Mr. Whittington! You seem to be taking my consent for
granted.
Whittington looked surprised.
Surely you are not thinking of refusing? I can assure you that Madame
Colombiers is a most high-class and orthodox establishment. And the
terms are most liberal.
Exactly, said Tuppence. Thats just it. The terms are almost too
liberal, Mr. Whittington. I cannot see any way in which I can be worth
that amount of money to you.
No? said Whittington softly. Well, I will tell you. I could doubtless
obtain some one else for very much less. What I am willing to pay for
is a young lady with sufficient intelligence and presence of mind to
sustain her part well, and also one who will have sufficient discretion
not to ask too many questions.
Tuppence smiled a little. She felt that Whittington had scored.
Theres another thing. So far there has been no mention of Mr.
Beresford. Where does he come in?
Mr. Beresford?
My partner, said Tuppence with dignity. You saw us together
yesterday.
Ah, yes. But Im afraid we shant require his services.
Then its off! Tuppence rose. Its both or neither. Sorry--but thats
how it is. Good morning, Mr. Whittington.
Wait a minute. Let us see if something cant be managed. Sit down
again, Miss---- He paused interrogatively.
Tuppences conscience gave her a passing twinge as she remembered the
archdeacon. She seized hurriedly on the first name that came into her
head.
Jane Finn, she said hastily; and then paused open-mouthed at the
effect of those two simple words.
All the geniality had faded out of Whittingtons face. It was purple
with rage, and the veins stood out on the forehead. And behind it all
there lurked a sort of incredulous dismay. He leaned forward and hissed
savagely:
So thats your little game, is it?
Tuppence, though utterly taken aback, nevertheless kept her head. She
had not the faintest comprehension of his meaning, but she was naturally
quick-witted, and felt it imperative to keep her end up as she phrased
it.
Whittington went on:
Been playing with me, have you, all the time, like a cat and mouse?
Knew all the time what I wanted you for, but kept up the comedy. Is that
it, eh? He was cooling down. The red colour was ebbing out of his face.
He eyed her keenly. Whos been blabbing? Rita?
Tuppence shook her head. She was doubtful as to how long she could
sustain this illusion, but she realized the importance of not dragging
an unknown Rita into it.
No, she replied with perfect truth. Rita knows nothing about me.
His eyes still bored into her like gimlets.
How much do you know? he shot out.
Very little indeed, answered Tuppence, and was pleased to note that
Whittingtons uneasiness was augmented instead of allayed. To have
boasted that she knew a lot might have raised doubts in his mind.
Anyway, snarled Whittington, you knew enough to come in here and
plump out that name.
