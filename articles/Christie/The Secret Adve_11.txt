They obeyed. He himself took a chair opposite to Tuppence and smiled at
her encouragingly. There was something in the quality of his smile that
made the girls usual readiness desert her.
As he did not seem inclined to open the conversation, Tuppence was
forced to begin.
We wanted to know--that is, would you be so kind as to tell us anything
you know about Jane Finn?
Jane Finn? Ah! Mr. Carter appeared to reflect. Well, the question is,
what do _you_ know about her?
Tuppence drew herself up.
I dont see that thats got anything to do with it.
No? But it has, you know, really it has. He smiled again in his tired
way, and continued reflectively. So that brings us down to it again.
What do _you_ know about Jane Finn?
Come now, he continued, as Tuppence remained silent. You must know
_something_ to have advertised as you did? He leaned forward a little,
his weary voice held a hint of persuasiveness. Suppose you tell me....
There was something very magnetic about Mr. Carters personality.
Tuppence seemed to shake herself free of it with an effort, as she said:
We couldnt do that, could we, Tommy?
But to her surprise, her companion did not back her up. His eyes were
fixed on Mr. Carter, and his tone when he spoke held an unusual note of
deference.
I dare say the little we know wont be any good to you, sir. But such
as it is, youre welcome to it.
Tommy! cried out Tuppence in surprise.
Mr. Carter slewed round in his chair. His eyes asked a question.
Tommy nodded.
Yes, sir, I recognized you at once. Saw you in France when I was with
the Intelligence. As soon as you came into the room, I knew----
Mr. Carter held up his hand.
No names, please. Im known as Mr. Carter here. Its my cousins house,
by the way. Shes willing to lend it to me sometimes when its a case of
working on strictly unofficial lines. Well, now--he looked from one to
the other--whos going to tell me the story?
Fire ahead, Tuppence, directed Tommy. Its your yarn.
Yes, little lady, out with it.
And obediently Tuppence did out with it, telling the whole story from
the forming of the Young Adventurers, Ltd., downwards.
Mr. Carter listened in silence with a resumption of his tired manner.
Now and then he passed his hand across his lips as though to hide a
smile. When she had finished he nodded gravely.
Not much. But suggestive. Quite suggestive. If youll excuse my saying
so, youre a curious young couple. I dont know--you might succeed where
others have failed ... I believe in luck, you know--always have....
He paused a moment, and then went on.
Well, how about it? Youre out for adventure. How would you like
to work for me? All quite unofficial, you know. Expenses paid, and a
moderate screw?
Tuppence gazed at him, her lips parted, her eyes growing wider and
wider.
