Well, we wouldnt mind hearing her back history, said Tuppence
guardedly.
But Mr. Hersheimmer seemed to grow suddenly suspicious.
See here, he declared. This isnt Sicily! No demanding ransom or
threatening to crop her ears if I refuse. These are the British Isles,
so quit the funny business, or Ill just sing out for that beautiful big
British policeman I see out there in Piccadilly.
Tommy hastened to explain.
We havent kidnapped your cousin. On the contrary, were trying to find
her. Were employed to do so.
Mr. Hersheimmer leant back in his chair.
Put me wise, he said succinctly.
Tommy fell in with this demand in so far as he gave him a guarded
version of the disappearance of Jane Finn, and of the possibility of her
having been mixed up unawares in some political show. He alluded to
Tuppence and himself as private inquiry agents commissioned to find
her, and added that they would therefore be glad of any details Mr.
Hersheimmer could give them.
That gentleman nodded approval.
I guess thats all right. I was just a mite hasty. But London gets my
goat! I only know little old New York. Just trot out your questions and
Ill answer.
For the moment this paralysed the Young Adventurers, but Tuppence,
recovering herself, plunged boldly into the breach with a reminiscence
culled from detective fiction.
When did you last see the dece--your cousin, I mean?
Never seen her, responded Mr. Hersheimmer.
What? demanded Tommy, astonished.
Hersheimmer turned to him.
No, sir. As I said before, my father and her mother were brother and
sister, just as you might be--Tommy did not correct this view of their
relationship--but they didnt always get on together. And when my aunt
made up her mind to marry Amos Finn, who was a poor school teacher out
West, my father was just mad! Said if he made his pile, as he seemed
in a fair way to do, shed never see a cent of it. Well, the upshot was
that Aunt Jane went out West and we never heard from her again.
The old man _did_ pile it up. He went into oil, and he went into steel,
and he played a bit with railroads, and I can tell you he made Wall
Street sit up! He paused. Then he died--last fall--and I got the
dollars. Well, would you believe it, my conscience got busy! Kept
knocking me up and saying: What about your Aunt Jane, way out West? It
worried me some. You see, I figured it out that Amos Finn would never
make good. He wasnt the sort. End of it was, I hired a man to hunt her
down. Result, she was dead, and Amos Finn was dead, but theyd left a
daughter--Jane--whod been torpedoed in the _Lusitania_ on her way to
Paris. She was saved all right, but they didnt seem able to hear of her
over this side. I guessed they werent hustling any, so I thought Id
come along over, and speed things up. I phoned Scotland Yard and the
Admiralty first thing. The Admiralty rather choked me off, but Scotland
Yard were very civil--said they would make inquiries, even sent a man
round this morning to get her photograph. Im off to Paris to-morrow,
just to see what the Prefecture is doing. I guess if I go to and fro
hustling them, they ought to get busy!
