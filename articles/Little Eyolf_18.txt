ALLMERS. [Interrupting.] Oh, nonsense--sacrifice! Don't talk of such a
thing.--I have only loved you, Asta, ever since you were a little child.
[After a short pause.] And then it always seemed to me that I had so
much injustice to make up to you for.
ASTA. [Astonished.] Injustice? You?
ALLMERS. Not precisely on my own account. But--
ASTA. [Eagerly.] But--?
ALLMERS. On father's.
ASTA. [Half rising from the bench.] On--father's! [Sitting down again.]
What do you mean by that, Alfred?
ALLMERS. Father was never really kind to you.
ASTA. [Vehemently.] Oh, don't say that!
ALLMERS. Yes, it is true. He did not love you--not as he ought to have.
ASTA. [Evasively.] No, perhaps not as he loved you. That was only
natural.
ALLMERS. [Continuing.] And he was often hard to your mother, too--at
least in the last years.
ASTA. [Softly.] Mother was so much, much younger than he--remember that.
ALLMERS. Do you think they were not quite suited to each other?
ASTA. Perhaps not.
ALLMERS. Yes, but still--. Father, who in other ways was so gentle and
warm-hearted--so kindly towards every one--
ASTA. [Quietly.] Mother, too, was not always as she ought to have been.
ALLMERS. Your mother was not!
ASTA. Perhaps not always.
ALLMERS. Towards father, do you mean?
ASTA. Yes.
ALLMERS. I never noticed that.
ASTA. [Struggling with her tears, rises.] Oh, my dear Alfred--let them
rest--those who are gone. [She goes towards the right.]
ALLMERS. [Rising.] Yes, let them rest. [Wringing his hands.] But those
who are gone--it is they that won't let us rest, Asta. Neither day nor
night.
ASTA. [Looks warmly at him.] Time will make it all seem easier, Alfred.
ALLMERS. [Looking helplessly at her.] Yes, don't you think it will?--But
how I am to get over these terrible first days [Hoarsely.]--that is what
I cannot imagine.
ASTA. [Imploringly, laying her hands on his shoulders.] Go up to Rita.
Oh, please do--
ALLMERS. [Vehemently, withdrawing from her.] No, no, no--don't talk to
me of that! I cannot, I tell you. [More calmly.] Let me remain here,
with you.
ASTA. Well, I will not leave you.
ALLMERS. [Seizing her hand and holding it fast.] Thank you for that!
[Looks out for a time over the fiord.] Where is my little Eyolf now?
[Smiling sadly to her.] Can you tell me that my big, wise Eyolf?
[Shaking his head.] No one in all the world can tell me that. I know
only this one terrible thing--that he is gone from me.
ASTA. [Looking up to the left, and withdrawing her hand.] Here they are
coming.
[MRS. ALLMERS and Engineer BORGHEIM come down by the wood-path, she
leading the way. She wears a dark dress and a black veil over her head.
He has an umbrella under his arm.]
ALLMERS. [Going to meet her.] How is it with you, Rita?
RITA. [Passing him.] Oh, don't ask.
ALLMERS. Why do you come here?
RITA. Only to look for you. What are you doing?
ALLMERS. Nothing. Asta came down to me.
