  _Romeo._ Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
  _Juliet._ Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
  _Romeo._ O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
  They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
  _Juliet._ Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
  _Romeo._ Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.
  Thus from my lips by thine my sin is purg'd.      [_Kissing her._
  _Juliet._ Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
  _Romeo._ Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg'd!
  Give me my sin again.
  _Juliet._                        You kiss by the book.           112
  _Nurse._ Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
  _Romeo._ What is her mother?
  _Nurse._                         Marry, bachelor,
  Her mother is the lady of the house,
  And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous.
  I nurs'd her daughter that you talk'd withal;
  I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
  Shall have the chinks.
  _Romeo._ Is she a Capulet?
  O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.                        120
  _Benvolio._ Away, be gone; the sport is at the best.
  _Romeo._ Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
  _Capulet._ Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
  We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.--
  Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all;
  I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.--
  More torches here!--Come on then, let's to bed.
  Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late;
  I'll to my rest.              [_Exeunt all but Juliet and Nurse._
  _Juliet._ Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?
  _Nurse._ The son and heir of old Tiberio.                         131
  _Juliet._ What's he that now is going out of door?
  _Nurse._ Marry, that, I think, be young Petruchio.
  _Juliet._ What's he that follows there, that would not dance?
  _Nurse._ I know not.
  _Juliet._ Go, ask his name.--If he be married,
  My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
  _Nurse._ His name is Romeo, and a Montague,
  The only son of your great enemy.
  _Juliet._ My only love sprung from my only hate!                 140
  Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
  Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
  That I must love a loathed enemy.
  _Nurse._ What's this? what's this?
  _Juliet._                        A rhyme I learn'd even now
  Of one I danc'd withal.             [_One calls within_ 'Juliet.'
  _Nurse._                         Anon, anon!--
  Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.          [_Exeunt._

ACT II
_Enter_ Chorus
  Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,
    And young affection gapes to be his heir;
  That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
    With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
  Now Romeo is belov'd and loves again,
    Alike bewitched by the charm of looks,
  But to his foe suppos'd he must complain,
    And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks.
  Being held a foe, he may not have access
    To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
  And she as much in love, her means much less
    To meet her new-beloved any where.
  But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,
  Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.                [_Exit._
