Also we have been told that, in the case we are discussing, _some_
Members of the Subject are in Class (1). What _else_ do we need to be
told, in order to know that _all_ of them are there? Evidently we need
to be told that _none_ of them are in Class (2); i.e. that _none_ of
them are Members of the Class whose Differentia is _contradictory_ to
that of the Predicate.
    [Thus, we may suppose we have been told that _some_ bankers are
    in the Class "rich men". What _else_ do we need to be told, in
    order to know that _all_ of them are there? Evidently we need to
    be told that _none_ of them are in the Class "_poor_ men".]
Hence a Proposition of Relation, beginning with "All", is a _Double_
Proposition, and is '=equivalent=' to (i.e. gives the same information
as) the _two_ Propositions
    (1) "_Some_ Members of the Subject are Members of the
    Predicate";
    (2) "_No_ Members of the Subject are Members of the
    Class whose Differentia is _contradictory_ to that of
    the Predicate".
    [Thus, the Proposition "_All_ bankers are rich men" is a
    _Double_ Proposition, and is equivalent to the _two_
    Propositions
        (1) "_Some_ bankers are rich men";
        (2) "_No_ bankers are _poor_ men".]
                                                                   pg019

_What is implied, in a Proposition of Relation, as to the Reality of its
Terms?_
Note that the rules, here laid down, are _arbitrary_, and only apply to
Part I of my "Symbolic Logic."
A Proposition of Relation, beginning with "Some", is henceforward to be
understood as asserting that there are _some existing Things_, which,
being Members of the Subject, are also Members of the Predicate; i.e.
that _some existing Things_ are Members of _both_ Terms at once. Hence
it is to be understood as implying that _each_ Term, taken by itself, is
_Real_.
    [Thus, the Proposition "Some rich men are invalids" is to be
    understood as asserting that _some existing Things_ are "rich
    invalids". Hence it implies that _each_ of the two Classes,
    "rich men" and "invalids", taken by itself, is _Real_.]
A Proposition of Relation, beginning with "No", is henceforward to be
understood as asserting that there are _no existing Things_ which, being
Members of the Subject, are also Members of the Predicate; i.e. that _no
existing Things_ are Members of _both_ Terms at once. But this implies
nothing as to the _Reality_ of either Term taken by itself.
    [Thus, the Proposition "No mermaids are milliners" is to be
    understood as asserting that _no existing Things_ are
    "mermaid-milliners". But this implies nothing as to the
    _Reality_, or the _Unreality_, of either of the two Classes,
    "mermaids" and "milliners", taken by itself. In this case as it
    happens, the Subject is _Imaginary_, and the Predicate _Real_.]
A Proposition of Relation, beginning with "All", contains (see Sec. 3) a
similar Proposition beginning with "Some". Hence it is to be understood
as implying that _each_ Term, taken by itself, is _Real_.
    [Thus, the Proposition "All hyaenas are savage animals" contains
    the Proposition "Some hyaenas are savage animals". Hence it
    implies that _each_ of the two Classes, "hyaenas" and "savage
    animals", taken by itself, is _Real_.]
