Forbear! exclaimed the Spectre in an awful voice.  Lay a hand on Me,
and die!
He stopped midway, as if its words had paralysed him, and stood looking
on it.  It had glided from him; it had its arm raised high in warning;
and a smile passed over its unearthly features, as it reared its dark
figure in triumph.
If I could forget my sorrow and wrong, I would, the Ghost repeated.
If I could forget my sorrow and my wrong, I would!
Evil spirit of myself, returned the haunted man, in a low, trembling
tone, my life is darkened by that incessant whisper.
It is an echo, said the Phantom.
If it be an echo of my thoughtsas now, indeed, I know it is, rejoined
the haunted man, why should I, therefore, be tormented?  It is not a
selfish thought.  I suffer it to range beyond myself.  All men and women
have their sorrows,most of them their wrongs; ingratitude, and sordid
jealousy, and interest, besetting all degrees of life.  Who would not
forget their sorrows and their wrongs?
Who would not, truly, and be happier and better for it? said the
Phantom.
These revolutions of years, which we commemorate, proceeded Redlaw,
what do _they_ recall!  Are there any minds in which they do not
re-awaken some sorrow, or some trouble?  What is the remembrance of the
old man who was here to-night?  A tissue of sorrow and trouble.
But common natures, said the Phantom, with its evil smile upon its
glassy face, unenlightened minds and ordinary spirits, do not feel or
reason on these things like men of higher cultivation and profounder
thought.
Tempter, answered Redlaw, whose hollow look and voice I dread more
than words can express, and from whom some dim foreshadowing of greater
fear is stealing over me while I speak, I hear again an echo of my own
mind.
Receive it as a proof that I am powerful, returned the Ghost.  Hear
what I offer!  Forget the sorrow, wrong, and trouble you have known!
Forget them! he repeated.
I have the power to cancel their remembranceto leave but very faint,
confused traces of them, that will die out soon, returned the Spectre.
Say!  Is it done?
Stay! cried the haunted man, arresting by a terrified gesture the
uplifted hand.  I tremble with distrust and doubt of you; and the dim
fear you cast upon me deepens into a nameless horror I can hardly bear.I
would not deprive myself of any kindly recollection, or any sympathy that
is good for me, or others.  What shall I lose, if I assent to this?  What
else will pass from my remembrance?
No knowledge; no result of study; nothing but the intertwisted chain of
feelings and associations, each in its turn dependent on, and nourished
by, the banished recollections.  Those will go.
Are they so many? said the haunted man, reflecting in alarm.
They have been wont to show themselves in the fire, in music, in the
wind, in the dead stillness of the night, in the revolving years,
returned the Phantom scornfully.
