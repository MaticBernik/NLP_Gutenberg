Avarice was, unhappily, my uncle Chills master-vice.  Though he was
rich, he pinched, and scraped, and clutched, and lived miserably.  As
Christiana had no fortune, I was for some time a little fearful of
confessing our engagement to him; but, at length I wrote him a letter,
saying how it all truly was.  I put it into his hand one night, on going
to bed.
As I came down-stairs next morning, shivering in the cold December air;
colder in my uncles unwarmed house than in the street, where the winter
sun did sometimes shine, and which was at all events enlivened by
cheerful faces and voices passing along; I carried a heavy heart towards
the long, low breakfast-room in which my uncle sat.  It was a large room
with a small fire, and there was a great bay window in it which the rain
had marked in the night as if with the tears of houseless people.  It
stared upon a raw yard, with a cracked stone pavement, and some rusted
iron railings half uprooted, whence an ugly out-building that had once
been a dissecting-room (in the time of the great surgeon who had
mortgaged the house to my uncle), stared at it.
We rose so early always, that at that time of the year we breakfasted by
candle-light.  When I went into the room, my uncle was so contracted by
the cold, and so huddled together in his chair behind the one dim candle,
that I did not see him until I was close to the table.
As I held out my hand to him, he caught up his stick (being infirm, he
always walked about the house with a stick), and made a blow at me, and
said, You fool!
Uncle, I returned, I didnt expect you to be so angry as this.  Nor
had I expected it, though he was a hard and angry old man.
You didnt expect! said he; when did you ever expect?  When did you
ever calculate, or look forward, you contemptible dog?
These are hard words, uncle!
Hard words?  Feathers, to pelt such an idiot as you with, said he.
Here!  Betsy Snap!  Look at him!
Betsy Snap was a withered, hard-favoured, yellow old womanour only
domesticalways employed, at this time of the morning, in rubbing my
uncles legs.  As my uncle adjured her to look at me, he put his lean
grip on the crown of her head, she kneeling beside him, and turned her
face towards me.  An involuntary thought connecting them both with the
Dissecting Room, as it must often have been in the surgeons time, passed
across my mind in the midst of my anxiety.
Look at the snivelling milksop! said my uncle.  Look at the baby!
This is the gentleman who, people say, is nobodys enemy but his own.
This is the gentleman who cant say no.  This is the gentleman who was
making such large profits in his business that he must needs take a
partner, tother day.  This is the gentleman who is going to marry a wife
without a penny, and who falls into the hands of Jezabels who are
speculating on my death!
