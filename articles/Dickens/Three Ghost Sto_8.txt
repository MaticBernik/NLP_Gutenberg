Where is my little sister, said the ghost, and where my angelic little
wife, and where is the boy I went to school with?
I entreated the phantom to be comforted, and above all things to take
heart respecting the loss of the boy he went to school with.  I
represented to him that probably that boy never did, within human
experience, come out well, when discovered.  I urged that I myself had,
in later life, turned up several boys whom I went to school with, and
none of them had at all answered.  I expressed my humble belief that that
boy never did answer.  I represented that he was a mythic character, a
delusion, and a snare.  I recounted how, the last time I found him, I
found him at a dinner party behind a wall of white cravat, with an
inconclusive opinion on every possible subject, and a power of silent
boredom absolutely Titanic.  I related how, on the strength of our having
been together at Old Doylances, he had asked himself to breakfast with
me (a social offence of the largest magnitude); how, fanning my weak
embers of belief in Doylances boys, I had let him in; and how, he had
proved to be a fearful wanderer about the earth, pursuing the race of
Adam with inexplicable notions concerning the currency, and with a
proposition that the Bank of England should, on pain of being abolished,
instantly strike off and circulate, God knows how many thousand millions
of ten-and-sixpenny notes.
The ghost heard me in silence, and with a fixed stare.  Barber! it
apostrophised me when I had finished.
Barber? I repeatedfor I am not of that profession.
Condemned, said the ghost, to shave a constant change of
customersnow, menow, a young mannow, thyself as thou artnow, thy
fathernow, thy grandfather; condemned, too, to lie down with a skeleton
every night, and to rise with it every morning
(I shuddered on hearing this dismal announcement.)
Barber!  Pursue me!
I had felt, even before the words were uttered, that I was under a spell
to pursue the phantom.  I immediately did so, and was in Master B.s room
no longer.
Most people know what long and fatiguing night journeys had been forced
upon the witches who used to confess, and who, no doubt, told the exact
truthparticularly as they were always assisted with leading questions,
and the Torture was always ready.  I asseverate that, during my
occupation of Master B.s room, I was taken by the ghost that haunted it,
on expeditions fully as long and wild as any of those.  Assuredly, I was
presented to no shabby old man with a goats horns and tail (something
between Pan and an old clothesman), holding conventional receptions, as
stupid as those of real life and less decent; but, I came upon other
things which appeared to me to have more meaning.
Confident that I speak the truth and shall be believed, I declare without
hesitation that I followed the ghost, in the first instance on a
broom-stick, and afterwards on a rocking-horse.  The very smell of the
animals paintespecially when I brought it out, by making him warmI am
ready to swear to.  I followed the ghost, afterwards, in a hackney coach;
an institution with the peculiar smell of which, the present generation
is unacquainted, but to which I am again ready to swear as a combination
of stable, dog with the mange, and very old bellows.  (In this, I appeal
to previous generations to confirm or refute me.)  I pursued the phantom,
on a headless donkey: at least, upon a donkey who was so interested in
the state of his stomach that his head was always down there,
investigating it; on ponies, expressly born to kick up behind; on
roundabouts and swings, from fairs; in the first cabanother forgotten
institution where the fare regularly got into bed, and was tucked up with
the driver.
