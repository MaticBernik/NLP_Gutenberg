But she had to take her farewell of the male part of the company yet, and
every one of them had to unfold his arms (for they all assumed the
professional attitude when they found themselves near Sleary), and give
her a parting kissMaster Kidderminster excepted, in whose young nature
there was an original flavour of the misanthrope, who was also known to
have harboured matrimonial views, and who moodily withdrew.  Mr. Sleary
was reserved until the last.  Opening his arms wide he took her by both
her hands, and would have sprung her up and down, after the riding-master
manner of congratulating young ladies on their dismounting from a rapid
act; but there was no rebound in Sissy, and she only stood before him
crying.
Good-bye, my dear! said Sleary.  Youll make your fortun, I hope, and
none of our poor folkth will ever trouble you, Ill pound it.  I with
your father hadnt taken hith dog with him; ith a ill-conwenienth to have
the dog out of the billth.  But on thecond thoughth, he wouldnt have
performed without hith mathter, tho ith ath broad ath ith long!
With that he regarded her attentively with his fixed eye, surveyed his
company with his loose one, kissed her, shook his head, and handed her to
Mr. Gradgrind as to a horse.
There the ith, Thquire, he said, sweeping her with a professional
glance as if she were being adjusted in her seat, and thell do you
juthtithe.  Good-bye, Thethilia!
Good-bye, Cecilia!  Good-bye, Sissy!  God bless you, dear!  In a
variety of voices from all the room.
But the riding-master eye had observed the bottle of the nine oils in her
bosom, and he now interposed with Leave the bottle, my dear; ith large
to carry; it will be of no uthe to you now.  Give it to me!
No, no! she said, in another burst of tears.  Oh, no!  Pray let me
keep it for father till he comes back!  He will want it when he comes
back.  He had never thought of going away, when he sent me for it.  I
must keep it for him, if you please!
Tho be it, my dear.  (You thee how it ith, Thquire!)  Farewell,
Thethilia!  My latht wordth to you ith thith, Thtick to the termth of
your engagement, be obedient to the Thquire, and forget uth.  But if,
when youre grown up and married and well off, you come upon any
horthe-riding ever, dont be hard upon it, dont be croth with it, give
it a Bethpeak if you can, and think you might do wurth.  People mutht be
amuthed, Thquire, thomehow, continued Sleary, rendered more pursy than
ever, by so much talking; they cant be alwayth a working, nor yet they
cant be alwayth a learning.  Make the betht of uth; not the wurtht.
Ive got my living out of the horthe-riding all my life, I know; but I
conthider that I lay down the philothophy of the thubject when I thay to
you, Thquire, make the betht of uth: not the wurtht!
