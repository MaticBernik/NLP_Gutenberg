Property of the public! exclaimed Sir Roger. Property of the public!
echoed the multitudinous voices of indignant Bullocksheds, Tenterhooks,
and Ramsbottoms. Why, Sir, do you dispute the right of Sir Roger
Rockville to his own estate?
By no means; replied the undaunted Daredeville; the estate of
Rockville is unquestionably the property of the honorable baronet, Sir
Roger Rockville; but the roads through it are the as unquestionable
property of the public.
The whole bench looked at itself; that is, at each other, in wrathful
astonishment. The swelling in the diaphragms of the squires Otterbrook,
Turnbull, and Swagsides, and all the rest of the worshipful row, was too
big to admit of utterance. Only Sir Roger himself burst forth with an
abrupt--
Impudent fellows! But Ill see them ---- first!
Grant the order! said Sir Benjamin Bullockshed; and the whole bench
nodded assent. The able lawyer Daredeville retired with a pleasant
smile. He saw an agreeable prospect of plenty of grist to his mill. Sir
Roger was rich, and so was Great Stockington. He rubbed his hands, not
in the least like a man defeated, and thought to himself, Let them go
at it--all right.
The next day the placards on the Rockville estate were changed for
others bearing STOPPED BY ORDER OF SESSIONS! and alongside of them
were huge carefully painted boards, denouncing on all trespassers
prosecutions according to law. The same evening came a prodigious
invasion of Stockingtonians--tore all the boards and placards down, and
carried them on their shoulders to Great Stockington, singing as they
went, See, the Conquering Heroes come! They set them up in the centre
of the Stockington market-place, and burnt them, along with an effigy of
Sir Roger Rockville.
That was grist at once to the mill of the able lawyer Daredeville. He
looked on, and rubbed his hands. Warrants were speedily issued by the
Baronets of Bullockshed and Tenterhook, for the apprehension of the
individuals who had been seen carrying off the notice-boards, for
larceny, and against a number of others for trespass. There was plenty
of work for Daredeville and his brethren of the robe; but it all ended,
after the flying about of sundry mandamuses and assize trials, in Sir
Roger finding that though Rockville was his, the roads through it were
the publics.
As Sir Roger drove homeward from the assize, which finally settled the
question of these footpaths, he heard the bells in all the steeples of
Great Stockington burst forth with a grand peal of triumph. He closed
fast the windows of his fine old carriage, and sunk into a corner; but
he could not drown the intolerable sound. But, said he, Ill stop
their pic-nic-ing. Ill stop their fishing. Ill have hold of them for
trespassing and poaching! There was war henceforth between Rockville
and Great Stockington.
On the very next Sunday there came literally thousands of the jubilant
Stockingtonians to Rockville. They had brought baskets, and were for
dining, and drinking success to all footpaths. But in the great grove
there were keepers, and watchers, who warned them to keep the path, that
narrow well-worn line up the middle of the grove. What! were they not
to sit on the grass?--No!--What! were they not to pic-nic?--No!
not there!
