And youre making love to her, are you? said Cute to the young smith.
Yes, returned Richard quickly, for he was nettled by the question.
And we are going to be married on New Years Day.
What do you mean! cried Filer sharply.  Married!
Why, yes, were thinking of it, Master, said Richard.  Were rather in
a hurry, you see, in case it should be Put Down first.
Ah! cried Filer, with a groan.  Put _that_ down indeed, Alderman, and
youll do something.  Married!  Married!!  The ignorance of the first
principles of political economy on the part of these people; their
improvidence; their wickedness; is, by Heavens! enough toNow look at
that couple, will you!
Well?  They were worth looking at.  And marriage seemed as reasonable and
fair a deed as they need have in contemplation.
A man may live to be as old as Methuselah, said Mr. Filer, and may
labour all his life for the benefit of such people as those; and may heap
up facts on figures, facts on figures, facts on figures, mountains high
and dry; and he can no more hope to persuade em that they have no right
or business to be married, than he can hope to persuade em that they
have no earthly right or business to be born.  And _that_ we know they
havent.  We reduced it to a mathematical certainty long ago!
Alderman Cute was mightily diverted, and laid his right forefinger on the
side of his nose, as much as to say to both his friends, Observe me,
will you!  Keep your eye on the practical man!and called Meg to him.
Come here, my girl! said Alderman Cute.
The young blood of her lover had been mounting, wrathfully, within the
last few minutes; and he was indisposed to let her come.  But, setting a
constraint upon himself, he came forward with a stride as Meg approached,
and stood beside her.  Trotty kept her hand within his arm still, but
looked from face to face as wildly as a sleeper in a dream.
Now, Im going to give you a word or two of good advice, my girl, said
the Alderman, in his nice easy way.  Its my place to give advice, you
know, because Im a Justice.  You know Im a Justice, dont you?
Meg timidly said, Yes.  But everybody knew Alderman Cute was a Justice!
Oh dear, so active a Justice always!  Who such a mote of brightness in
the public eye, as Cute!
You are going to be married, you say, pursued the Alderman.  Very
unbecoming and indelicate in one of your sex!  But never mind that.
After you are married, youll quarrel with your husband and come to be a
distressed wife.  You may think not; but you will, because I tell you so.
Now, I give you fair warning, that I have made up my mind to Put
distressed wives Down.  So, dont be brought before me.  Youll have
childrenboys.  Those boys will grow up bad, of course, and run wild in
the streets, without shoes and stockings.  Mind, my young friend!  Ill
convict em summarily, every one, for I am determined to Put boys without
shoes and stockings, Down.  Perhaps your husband will die young (most
likely) and leave you with a baby.  Then youll be turned out of doors,
and wander up and down the streets.  Now, dont wander near me, my dear,
for I am resolved, to Put all wandering mothers Down.  All young mothers,
of all sorts and kinds, its my determination to Put Down.  Dont think
to plead illness as an excuse with me; or babies as an excuse with me;
for all sick persons and young children (I hope you know the
church-service, but Im afraid not) I am determined to Put Down.  And if
you attempt, desperately, and ungratefully, and impiously, and
fraudulently attempt, to drown yourself, or hang yourself, Ill have no
pity for you, for I have made up my mind to Put all suicide Down!  If
there is one thing, said the Alderman, with his self-satisfied smile,
on which I can be said to have made up my mind more than on another, it
is to Put suicide Down.  So dont try it on.  Thats the phrase, isnt
it?  Ha, ha! now we understand each other.
