    There was an old woman, and what do you think?
    She lived upon nothing but victuals and drink;
    Victuals and drink were the whole of her diet,
    And yet this old woman would NEVER be quiet.
Is it possible, I wonder, that there was any analogy between the case of
the Coketown population and the case of the little Gradgrinds?  Surely,
none of us in our sober senses and acquainted with figures, are to be
told at this time of day, that one of the foremost elements in the
existence of the Coketown working-people had been for scores of years,
deliberately set at nought?  That there was any Fancy in them demanding
to be brought into healthy existence instead of struggling on in
convulsions?  That exactly in the ratio as they worked long and
monotonously, the craving grew within them for some physical reliefsome
relaxation, encouraging good humour and good spirits, and giving them a
ventsome recognized holiday, though it were but for an honest dance to a
stirring band of musicsome occasional light pie in which even
MChoakumchild had no fingerwhich craving must and would be satisfied
aright, or must and would inevitably go wrong, until the laws of the
Creation were repealed?
This man lives at Pods End, and I dont quite know Pods End, said Mr.
Gradgrind.  Which is it, Bounderby?
Mr. Bounderby knew it was somewhere down town, but knew no more
respecting it.  So they stopped for a moment, looking about.
Almost as they did so, there came running round the corner of the street
at a quick pace and with a frightened look, a girl whom Mr. Gradgrind
recognized.  Halloa! said he.  Stop!  Where are you going! Stop!
Girl number twenty stopped then, palpitating, and made him a curtsey.
Why are you tearing about the streets, said Mr. Gradgrind, in this
improper manner?
I wasI was run after, sir, the girl panted, and I wanted to get
away.
Run after? repeated Mr. Gradgrind.  Who would run after _you_?
The question was unexpectedly and suddenly answered for her, by the
colourless boy, Bitzer, who came round the corner with such blind speed
and so little anticipating a stoppage on the pavement, that he brought
himself up against Mr. Gradgrinds waistcoat and rebounded into the road.
What do you mean, boy? said Mr. Gradgrind.  What are you doing?  How
dare you dash againsteverybodyin this manner?  Bitzer picked up his
cap, which the concussion had knocked off; and backing, and knuckling his
forehead, pleaded that it was an accident.
Was this boy running after you, Jupe? asked Mr. Gradgrind.
Yes, sir, said the girl reluctantly.
No, I wasnt, sir! cried Bitzer.  Not till she run away from me.  But
the horse-riders never mind what they say, sir; theyre famous for it.
You know the horse-riders are famous for never minding what they say,
addressing Sissy.  Its as well known in the town asplease, sir, as the
multiplication table isnt known to the horse-riders.  Bitzer tried Mr.
Bounderby with this.
