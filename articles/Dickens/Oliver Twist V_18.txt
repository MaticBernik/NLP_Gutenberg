Dear me, said the gentleman, in the bottle-green coat, hastily rising
with great politeness, I beg your pardon, young ladyI imagined it
was some importunate person whoI beg you will excuse me. Be seated,
pray.
Mr. Brownlow, I believe, sir? said Rose, glancing from the other
gentleman to the one who had spoken.
That is my name, said the old gentleman. This is my friend, Mr.
Grimwig. Grimwig, will you leave us for a few minutes?
I believe, interposed Miss Maylie, that at this period of our
interview I need not give that gentleman the trouble of going away. If
I am correctly informed, he is cognizant of the business on which I
wish to speak to you.
Mr. Brownlow inclined his head, and Mr. Grimwig, who had made one very
stiff bow, and risen from his chair, made another very stiff bow, and
dropped into it again.
I shall surprise you very much, I have no doubt, said Rose, naturally
embarrassed; but you once showed great benevolence and goodness to a
very dear young friend of mine, and I am sure you will take an interest
in hearing of him again.
Indeed! said Mr. Brownlow. May I ask his name?
Oliver Twist you knew him as, replied Rose.
The words no sooner escaped her lips than Mr. Grimwig, who had been
affecting to dip into a large book that lay on the table, upset it
with a great crash, and falling back in his chair, discharged from
his features every expression but one of the most unmitigated wonder,
and indulged in a prolonged and vacant stare; then, as if ashamed of
having betrayed so much emotion, he jerked himself, as it were, by a
convulsion into his former attitude, and looking out straight before
him emitted a long, deep whistle, which seemed at last not to be
discharged on empty air, but to die away in the inmost recesses of his
stomach.
Mr. Brownlow was no less surprised, although his astonishment was not
expressed in the same eccentric manner. He drew his chair nearer to
Miss Maylies, and said,
Do me the favour, my dear young lady, to leave entirely out of the
question that goodness and benevolence of which you speak, and of which
nobody else knows any thing, and if you have it in your power to
produce any evidence which will alter the unfavourable opinion I was
once induced to entertain of that poor child, in Heavens name put me
in possession of it.
A bad oneIll eat my head if he is not a bad one, growled Mr.
Grimwig, speaking by some ventriloquial power, without moving a muscle
of his face.
He is a child of a noble nature and a warm heart, said Rose,
colouring; and that Power which has thought fit to try him beyond his
years has planted in his breast affections and feelings which would do
honour to many who have numbered his days six times over.
Im only sixty-one, said Mr. Grimwig, with the same rigid face, and,
as the devils in it if this Oliver is not twelve at least, I dont see
the application of that remark.
