These distinctive notes are of a nature more easily to be felt than
described, and to make them felt examples will best serve. Take then a
passage from the soliloquy of Brutus just after he has pledged himself
to the conspiracy:
                     'Tis a common proof,
  That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,
  Whereto the climber upward turns his face;
  But when he once attains the upmost round,
  He then unto the ladder turns his back,
  Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees
  By which he did ascend. [II, i, 21-27.]
Here we have a full, rounded period in which all the elements seem to
have been adjusted, and the whole expression set in order, before any
part of it was written down. The beginning foresees the end, the end
remembers the beginning, and the thought and image are evolved together
in an even, continuous flow. The thing is indeed perfect in its way,
still it is not in Shakespeare's latest and highest style. Now take a
passage from _The Winter's Tale_:
                    When you speak, sweet,
  I'ld have you do it ever: when you sing,
  I'ld have you buy and sell so, so give alms,
  Pray so; and, for the ordering your affairs,
  To sing them too: when you do dance, I wish you
  A wave o' the sea, that you might ever do
  Nothing but that; move still, still so,
  And own no other function. [IV, iv, 136-143.]
Here the workmanship seems to make and shape itself as it goes along,
thought kindling thought, and image prompting image, and each part
neither concerning itself with what has gone before, nor with what is
coming after. The very sweetness has a certain piercing quality, and we
taste it from clause to clause, almost from word to word, as so many
keen darts of poetic rapture shot forth in rapid succession. Yet the
passage, notwithstanding its swift changes of imagery and motion, is
perfect in unity and continuity.
III. EARLY EDITIONS
FOLIOS
On November 8, 1623, Edward Blount and Isaac Jaggard obtained formal
license to print "Mr. William Shakespeere's Comedyes, Histories, and
Tragedyes, soe many of the said copies as are not formerly entered to
other men." This is the description-entry in _The Stationers' Registers_
of what is now known as the First Folio (1623), designated in the
textual notes of this edition F1. _Julius Caesar_ is one of the plays
"not formerly entered,"[1] and it was first printed, so far as is known,
in this famous volume. It is more correctly printed than perhaps any
other play in the First Folio and, as the editors of the Cambridge
Shakespeare suggest, "may perhaps have been (as the preface falsely
implied that all were[2]) printed from the original manuscript of the
author."[3] It stands between _Timon of Athens_ and _Macbeth_, two very
badly printed plays. The running title is _The Tragedie of Julius
Caesar_, but in the "Catalogve of the seuerall Comedies, Histories, and
Tragedies contained in this Volume," the title is given as _The Life and
Death of Julius Caesar_.
