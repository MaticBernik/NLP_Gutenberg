SCENE III. _The same. ANTONIO'S house._
  _Enter ANTONIO and PANTHINO._
_Ant._ Tell me, Panthino, what sad talk was that
Wherewith my brother held you in the cloister?
_Pan._ 'Twas of his nephew Proteus, your son.
_Ant._ Why, what of him?
_Pan._                 He wonder'd that your lordship
Would suffer him to spend his youth at home,                         5
While other men, of slender reputation,
Put forth their sons to seek preferment out:
Some to the wars, to try their fortune there;
Some to discover islands far away;
Some to the studious universities.                                  10
For any, or for all these exercises,
He said that Proteus your son was meet;
And did request me to importune you
To let him spend his time no more at home,
Which would be great impeachment to his age,                        15
In having known no travel in his youth.
_Ant._ Nor need'st thou much importune me to that
Whereon this month I have been hammering.
I have consider'd well his loss of time,
And how he cannot be a perfect man,                                 20
Not being tried and tutor'd in the world:
Experience is by industry achieved,
And perfected by the swift course of time.
Then, tell me, whither were I best to send him?
_Pan._ I think your lordship is not ignorant                        25
How his companion, youthful Valentine,
Attends the emperor in his royal court.
_Ant._ I know it well.
_Pan._ 'Twere good, I think, your lordship sent him thither:
There shall he practise tilts and tournaments,                      30
Hear sweet discourse, converse with noblemen,
And be in eye of every exercise
Worthy his youth and nobleness of birth.
