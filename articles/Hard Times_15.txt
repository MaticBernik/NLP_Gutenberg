Poor Sissy!  He had better have apprenticed her, said Childers, giving
his hair another shake, as he looked up from the empty box.  Now, he
leaves her without anything to take to.
It is creditable to you, who have never been apprenticed, to express
that opinion, returned Mr. Gradgrind, approvingly.
_I_ never apprenticed?  I was apprenticed when I was seven year old.
Oh!  Indeed? said Mr. Gradgrind, rather resentfully, as having been
defrauded of his good opinion.  I was not aware of its being the custom
to apprentice young persons to
Idleness, Mr. Bounderby put in with a loud laugh.  No, by the Lord
Harry!  Nor I!
Her father always had it in his head, resumed Childers, feigning
unconsciousness of Mr. Bounderbys existence, that she was to be taught
the deuce-and-all of education.  How it got into his head, I cant say; I
can only say that it never got out.  He has been picking up a bit of
reading for her, hereand a bit of writing for her, thereand a bit of
ciphering for her, somewhere elsethese seven years.
Mr. E. W. B. Childers took one of his hands out of his pockets, stroked
his face and chin, and looked, with a good deal of doubt and a little
hope, at Mr. Gradgrind.  From the first he had sought to conciliate that
gentleman, for the sake of the deserted girl.
When Sissy got into the school here, he pursued, her father was as
pleased as Punch.  I couldnt altogether make out why, myself, as we were
not stationary here, being but comers and goers anywhere.  I suppose,
however, he had this move in his mindhe was always half-crackedand then
considered her provided for.  If you should happen to have looked in
to-night, for the purpose of telling him that you were going to do her
any little service, said Mr. Childers, stroking his face again, and
repeating his look, it would be very fortunate and well-timed; very
fortunate and well-timed.
On the contrary, returned Mr. Gradgrind.  I came to tell him that her
connections made her not an object for the school, and that she must not
attend any more.  Still, if her father really has left her, without any
connivance on her partBounderby, let me have a word with you.
Upon this, Mr. Childers politely betook himself, with his equestrian
walk, to the landing outside the door, and there stood stroking his face,
and softly whistling.  While thus engaged, he overheard such phrases in
Mr. Bounderbys voice as No.  _I_ say no.  I advise you not.  I say by
no means.  While, from Mr. Gradgrind, he heard in his much lower tone
the words, But even as an example to Louisa, of what this pursuit which
has been the subject of a vulgar curiosity, leads to and ends in.  Think
of it, Bounderby, in that point of view.
Meanwhile, the various members of Slearys company gradually gathered
together from the upper regions, where they were quartered, and, from
standing about, talking in low voices to one another and to Mr. Childers,
gradually insinuated themselves and him into the room.  There were two or
three handsome young women among them, with their two or three husbands,
and their two or three mothers, and their eight or nine little children,
who did the fairy business when required.  The father of one of the
families was in the habit of balancing the father of another of the
families on the top of a great pole; the father of a third family often
made a pyramid of both those fathers, with Master Kidderminster for the
apex, and himself for the base; all the fathers could dance upon rolling
casks, stand upon bottles, catch knives and balls, twirl hand-basins,
ride upon anything, jump over everything, and stick at nothing.  All the
mothers could (and did) dance, upon the slack wire and the tight-rope,
and perform rapid acts on bare-backed steeds; none of them were at all
particular in respect of showing their legs; and one of them, alone in a
Greek chariot, drove six in hand into every town they came to.  They all
assumed to be mighty rakish and knowing, they were not very tidy in their
private dresses, they were not at all orderly in their domestic
arrangements, and the combined literature of the whole company would have
produced but a poor letter on any subject.  Yet there was a remarkable
gentleness and childishness about these people, a special inaptitude for
any kind of sharp practice, and an untiring readiness to help and pity
one another, deserving often of as much respect, and always of as much
generous construction, as the every-day virtues of any class of people in
the world.
