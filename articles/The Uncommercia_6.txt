Long before I reached Wapping, I gave myself up as having lost my way,
and, abandoning myself to the narrow streets in a Turkish frame of mind,
relied on predestination to bring me somehow or other to the place I
wanted if I were ever to get there.  When I had ceased for an hour or so
to take any trouble about the matter, I found myself on a swing-bridge
looking down at some dark locks in some dirty water.  Over against me,
stood a creature remotely in the likeness of a young man, with a puffed
sallow face, and a figure all dirty and shiny and slimy, who may have
been the youngest son of his filthy old father, Thames, or the drowned
man about whom there was a placard on the granite post like a large
thimble, that stood between us.
I asked this apparition what it called the place?  Unto which, it
replied, with a ghastly grin and a sound like gurgling water in its
throat:
Mr. Bakers trap.
As it is a point of great sensitiveness with me on such occasions to be
equal to the intellectual pressure of the conversation, I deeply
considered the meaning of this speech, while I eyed the apparitionthen
engaged in hugging and sucking a horizontal iron bar at the top of the
locks.  Inspiration suggested to me that Mr. Baker was the acting coroner
of that neighbourhood.
A common place for suicide, said I, looking down at the locks.
Sue? returned the ghost, with a stare.  Yes!  And Poll.  Likewise
Emily.  And Nancy.  And Jane; he sucked the iron between each name; and
all the bileing.  Ketches off their bonnets or shorls, takes a run, and
headers down here, they doos.  Always a headerin down here, they is.
Like one oclock.
And at about that hour of the morning, I suppose?
Ah! said the apparition.  _They_ ant partickler.  Two ull do for
_them_.  Three.  All times o night.  Ony mind you!  Here the
apparition rested his profile on the bar, and gurgled in a sarcastic
manner.  There must be somebody comin.  They dont go a headerin down
here, wen there ant no Bobby nor genral Cove, fur to hear the splash.
According to my interpretation of these words, I was myself a General
Cove, or member of the miscellaneous public.  In which modest character I
remarked:
They are often taken out, are they, and restored?
I dunno about restored, said the apparition, who, for some occult
reason, very much objected to that word; theyre carried into the
werkiss and put into a ot bath, and brought round.  But I dunno about
restored, said the apparition; blow _that_!and vanished.
As it had shown a desire to become offensive, I was not sorry to find
myself alone, especially as the werkiss it had indicated with a twist
of its matted head, was close at hand.  So I left Mr. Bakers terrible
trap (baited with a scum that was like the soapy rinsing of sooty
chimneys), and made bold to ring at the workhouse gate, where I was
wholly unexpected and quite unknown.
