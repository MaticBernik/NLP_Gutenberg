_Translation of a Proposition of Relation into one or more Propositions
of Existence._
We have seen that a Proposition of Relation, beginning with "Some,"
asserts that _some existing Things_, being Members of its Subject, are
_also_ Members of its Predicate. Hence, it asserts that some existing
Things are Members of _both_; i.e. it asserts that some existing Things
are Members of the Class of Things which have _all_ the Attributes of
the Subject and the Predicate.
Hence, to translate it into a Proposition of Existence, we take
"existing Things" as the new _Subject_, and Things, which have _all_ the
Attributes of the Subject and the Predicate, as the new Predicate.
Similarly for a Proposition of Relation beginning with "No".
A Proposition of Relation, beginning with "All", is (as shown in Sec. 3)
equivalent to _two_ Propositions, one beginning with "Some" and the
other with "No", each of which we now know how to translate.
    [Let us work a few Examples, to illustrate these Rules.
    (1)
        "Some apples are not ripe."
    Here we arrange thus:--
        "Some"                     _Sign of Quantity_.
        "existing Things"          _Subject_.
        "are"                      _Copula_.
        "not-ripe apples"          _Predicate_.
    or thus:--
        "Some | existing Things | are | not-ripe apples."
                                                                   pg021
    (2)
        "Some farmers always grumble at the weather, whatever
        it may be."
    Here we arrange thus:--
        "Some | existing Things | are | farmers who always
        grumble at the weather, whatever it may be."
    (3)
        "No lambs are accustomed to smoke cigars."
    Here we arrange thus:--
        "No | existing Things |are | lambs accustomed to
        smoke cigars."
    (4)
        "None of my speculations have brought me as much
        as 5 per cent."
    Here we arrange thus:--
        "No | existing Things | are | speculations of mine,
        which have brought me as much as 5 per cent."
    (5)
        "None but the brave deserve the fair."
    Here we note, to begin with, that the phrase "none but the
    brave" is equivalent to "no not-brave men." We then arrange
    thus:--
        "No | existing Things | are | not-brave men deserving
        of the fair."
    (6)
        "All bankers are rich men."
    This is equivalent to the two Propositions "Some bankers are
    rich men" and "No bankers are poor men."
    Here we arrange thus:--
        "Some | existing Things | are | rich bankers";
            and
        "No | existing Things | are | poor bankers."]

CHAPTER I.
_SYMBOLS AND CELLS._
First, let us suppose that the above Diagram is an enclosure assigned to
a certain Class of Things, which we have selected as our 'Universe of
Discourse.' or, more briefly, as our 'Univ'.
    [For example, we might say "Let Univ. be 'books'"; and we might
    imagine the Diagram to be a large table, assigned to all
    "books."]
    [The Reader is strongly advised, in reading this Chapter, _not_
    to refer to the above Diagram, but to draw a large one for
    himself, _without any letters_, and to have it by him while he
    reads, and keep his finger on that particular _part_ of it,
    about which he is reading.]
                                                                   pg023
Secondly, let us suppose that we have selected a certain Adjunct, which
we may call "x," and have divided the large Class, to which we have
assigned the whole Diagram, into the two smaller Classes whose
Differentiae are "x" and "not-x" (which we may call "x'"), and that we
have assigned the _North_ Half of the Diagram to the one (which we may
call "the Class of x-Things," or "the x-Class"), and the _South_ Half to
the other (which we may call "the Class of x'-Things," or "the
x'-Class").
