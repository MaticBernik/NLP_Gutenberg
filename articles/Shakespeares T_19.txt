  _Romeo._ O, let us hence! I stand on sudden haste.
  _Friar Laurence._ Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
                                                         [_Exeunt._
SCENE IV. _A Street_
_Enter_ BENVOLIO _and_ MERCUTIO
  _Mercutio._ Where the devil should this Romeo be?
  Came he not home to-night?
  _Benvolio._ Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
  _Mercutio._ Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline,
  Torments him so that he will sure run mad.
  _Benvolio._ Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,
  Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
  _Mercutio._ A challenge, on my life.
  _Benvolio._ Romeo will answer it.
  _Mercutio._ Any man that can write may answer                     10
  a letter.
  _Benvolio._ Nay, he will answer the letter's master,
  how he dares, being dared.
  _Mercutio._ Alas, poor Romeo! he is already dead;
  stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot thorough
  the ear with a love-song; the very pin of his
  heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft; and
  is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
  _Benvolio._ Why, what is Tybalt?
  _Mercutio._ More than prince of cats, I can tell you.             20
  O, he is the courageous captain of compliments! He
  fights as you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance,
  and proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two,
  and the third in your bosom; the very butcher of a
  silk button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the
  very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah,
  the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the hay!
  _Benvolio._ The what?
  _Mercutio._ The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting
  fantasticoes, these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,              30
  a very good blade! a very tall man!'--Why, is not
  this a lamentable thing, grandsire, that we should be
  thus afflicted with these strange flies, these fashion-mongers,
  these _pardonnez-mois_, who stand so much
  on the new form that they cannot sit at ease on the
  old bench? O, their _bons_, their _bons!_
_Enter_ ROMEO
  _Benvolio._ Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.
  _Mercutio._ Without his roe, like a dried herring. O
  flesh, flesh, how art thou fishified! Now is he for the
  numbers that Petrarch flowed in; Laura to his lady                40
  was but a kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better
  love to be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra
  a gypsy; Helen and Hero hildings and harlots;
  Thisbe a grey eye or so, but not to the purpose.--Signior
  Romeo, _bon jour_! there's a French salutation
  to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
  fairly last night.
  _Romeo._ Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit
  did I give you?
  _Mercutio._ The slip, sir, the slip; can you not                  50
  conceive?
  _Romeo._ Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was
  great; and in such a case as mine a man may strain
  courtesy.
  _Mercutio._ That's as much as to say, such a case
  as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.
  _Romeo._ Meaning, to curtsy.
  _Mercutio._ Thou hast most kindly hit it.
  _Romeo._ A most courteous exposition.
  _Mercutio._ Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.                  60
  _Romeo._ Pink for flower.
