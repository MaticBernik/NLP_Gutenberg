    (4) Let Univ. be "persons."
    (5) The Sign of Quantity is "no."
    (6) The Proposition now becomes
        "No | not-brave persons | are | persons deserving
        of the fair."

    "A lame puppy would not say "thank you" if you offered to lend
    it a skipping-rope."
    (1) The Subject is evidently "lame puppies," and all the rest of
    the sentence must somehow be packed into the Predicate.
    (2) The Verb is "would not say," &c., for which we may
    substitute the phrase "are not grateful for."
    (3) The Predicate may be expressed as "* * * not grateful for
    the loan of a skipping-rope."
    (4) Let Univ. be "puppies."
    (5) The Sign of Quantity is "all."
    (6) The Proposition now becomes
        "All | lame puppies | are | puppies not grateful
        for the loan of a skipping-rope."
                                                                   pg015

    "No one takes in the _Times_, unless he is well-educated."
    (1) The Subject is evidently persons who are not well-educated
    ("no _one_" evidently means "no _person_").
    (2) The Verb is "takes in," for which we may substitute the
    phrase "are persons taking in."
    (3) The Predicate is "persons taking in the _Times_."
    (4) Let Univ. be "persons."
    (5) The Sign of Quantity is "no."
    (6) The Proposition now becomes
        "No | persons who are not well-educated | are |
        persons taking in the _Times_."
    (6)
    "My carriage will meet you at the station."
    (1) The Subject is "my carriage." This, being an 'Individual,'
    is equivalent to the Class "my carriages." (Note that this Class
    contains only _one_ Member.)
    (2) The Verb is "will meet", for which we may substitute the
    phrase "are * * * that will meet."
    (3) The Predicate is "* * * that will meet you at the station."
    (4) Let Univ. be "things."
    (5) The Sign of Quantity is "all."
    (6) The Proposition now becomes
        "All | my carriages | are | things that will meet
         you at the station."
    (7)
    "Happy is the man who does not know what 'toothache' means!"
    (1) The Subject is evidently "the man &c." (Note that in this
    sentence, the _Predicate_ comes first.) At first sight, the
    Subject seems to be an '_Individual_'; but on further
    consideration, we see that the article "the" does _not_ imply
    that there is only _one_ such man. Hence the phrase "the man
    who" is equivalent to "all men who".
    (2) The Verb is "are."
    (3) The Predicate is "happy * * *."
    (4) Let Univ. be "men."
    (5) The Sign of Quantity is "all."
    (6) The Proposition now becomes
        "All | men who do not know what 'toothache'
        means | are | happy men."
                                                                   pg016

    "Some farmers always grumble at the weather, whatever it may
    be."
    (1) The Subject is "farmers."
    (2) The Verb is "grumble," for which we substitute the phrase
    "are * * * who grumble."
    (3) The Predicate is "* * * who always grumble &c."
    (4) Let Univ. be "persons."
    (5) The Sign of Quantity is "some."
    (6) The Proposition now becomes
