_Cour._ Your man and you are marvellous merry, sir.
Will you go with me? We'll mend our dinner here?
_Dro. S._ Master, if you do, expect spoon-meat; or bespeak          55
a long spoon.
_Ant. S._ Why, Dromio?
_Dro. S._ Marry, he must have a long spoon that must
eat with the devil.
_Ant. S._ Avoid then, fiend! what tell'st thou me of supping?       60
Thou art, as you are all, a sorceress:
I conjure thee to leave me and be gone.
_Cour._ Give me the ring of mine you had at dinner,
Or, for my diamond, the chain you promised,
And I'll be gone, sir, and not trouble you.                         65
_Dro. S._ Some devils ask but the parings of one's nail,
A rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin,
A nut, a cherry-stone;
But she, more covetous, would have a chain.
Master, be wise: an if you give it her,                             70
The devil will shake her chain, and fright us with it.
_Cour._ I pray you, sir, my ring, or else the chain:
I hope you do not mean to cheat me so.
_Ant. S._ Avaunt, thou witch! --Come, Dromio, let us go.
_Dro. S._ 'Fly pride,' says the peacock: mistress, that you know.
    [_Exeunt Ant. S. and Dro. S._                                   75
_Cour._ Now, out of doubt Antipholus is mad,
Else would he never so demean himself.
A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats,
And for the same he promised me a chain:
Both one and other he denies me now.                                80
The reason that I gather he is mad,--
Besides this present instance of his rage,--
Is a mad tale he told to-day at dinner,
Of his own doors being shut against his entrance.
Belike his wife, acquainted with his fits,                          85
On purpose shut the doors against his way.
My way is now to his home to his house,
And tell his wife that, being lunatic,
He rush'd into my house, and took perforce
My ring away. This course I fittest choose;                         90
For forty ducats is too much to lose.    [_Exit._
