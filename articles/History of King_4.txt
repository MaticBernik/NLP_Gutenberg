[Exit.]
BUCKINGHAM.
Lord cardinal, I will follow Eleanor,
And listen after Humphrey, how he proceeds.
She's tickled now; her fume needs no spurs,
She'll gallop far enough to her destruction.
[Exit.]
[Re-enter GLOSTER.]
GLOSTER.
Now, lords, my choler being overblown
With walking once about the quadrangle,
I come to talk of commonwealth affairs.
As for your spiteful false objections,
Prove them, and I lie open to the law;
But God in mercy so deal with my soul
As I in duty love my king and country!
But, to the matter that we have in hand:
I say, my sovereign, York is meetest man
To be your regent in the realm of France.
SUFFOLK.
Before we make election, give me leave
To show some reason, of no little force,
That York is most unmeet of any man.
YORK.
I'll tell thee, Suffolk, why I am unmeet:
First, for I cannot flatter thee in pride;
Next, if I be appointed for the place,
My Lord of Somerset will keep me here,
Without discharge, money, or furniture,
Till France be won into the Dauphin's hands.
Last time, I danc'd attendance on his will
Till Paris was besieg'd, famish'd, and lost.
WARWICK.
That can I witness; and a fouler fact
Did never traitor in the land commit.
SUFFOLK.
Peace, headstrong Warwick!
WARWICK.
Image of pride, why should I hold my peace?
[Enter HORNER and his man PETER, guarded.]
SUFFOLK.
Because here is a man accus'd of treason.
Pray God the Duke of York excuse himself!
YORK.
Doth any one accuse York for a traitor?
KING.
What mean'st thou, Suffolk? tell me, what are these?
SUFFOLK.
Please it your majesty, this is the man
That doth accuse his master of high treason.
His words were these: that Richard Duke of York
Was rightful heir unto the English crown,
And that your majesty was an usurper.
KING.
Say, man, were these thy words?
HORNER.
An 't shall please your majesty, I never said nor
thought any such matter; God is my witness, I am
falsely accused by the villain.
PETER.
By these ten bones, my lords, he did speak them to
me in the garret one night, as we were scouring my Lord of
York's armour.
YORK.
Base dunghill villain and mechanical,
I'll have thy head for this thy traitor's speech.--
I do beseech your royal majesty,
Let him have all the rigour of the law.
HORNER.
Alas, my lord, hang me if ever I spake the words. My
accuser is my prentice; and when I did correct him for his fault
the other day, he did vow upon his knees he would be even with
me. I have good witness of this; therefore I beseech your
majesty, do not cast away an honest man for a villain's
accusation.
KING.
Uncle, what shall we say to this in law?
GLOSTER.
This doom, my lord, if I may judge:
Let Somerset be Regent o'er the French,
Because in York this breeds suspicion;
And let these have a day appointed them
For single combat in convenient place,
For he hath witness of his servant's malice.
This is the law, and this Duke Humphrey's doom.
