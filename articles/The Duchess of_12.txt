DUCHESS [_turns her back and opens it_]
   Now, traitor, tell me what does this sign mean,
   A dagger with two leopards wrought in steel?
GUIDO [_taking it from her_]
   O God!
DUCHESS
   Ill from the window look, and try
   If I cant see the porters livery
   Who left it at the gate!  I will not rest
   Till I have learned your secret.
                                      [_Runs laughing into the corridor_.]
GUIDO
   Oh, horrible!
   Had I so soon forgot my fathers death,
   Did I so soon let love into my heart,
   And must I banish love, and let in murder
   That beats and clamours at the outer gate?
   Ay, that I must!  Have I not sworn an oath?
   Yet not to-night; nay, it must be to-night.
   Farewell then all the joy and light of life,
   All dear recorded memories, farewell,
   Farewell all love!  Could I with bloody hands
   Fondle and paddle with her innocent hands?
   Could I with lips fresh from this butchery
   Play with her lips?  Could I with murderous eyes
   Look in those violet eyes, whose purity
   Would strike men blind, and make each eyeball reel
   In night perpetual?  No, murder has set
   A barrier between us far too high
   For us to kiss across it.
DUCHESS
   Guido!
GUIDO
   Beatrice,
   You must forget that name, and banish me
   Out of your life for ever.
DUCHESS [_going towards him_]
   O dear love!
GUIDO [_stepping back_]
   There lies a barrier between us two
   We dare not pass.
DUCHESS
   I dare do anything
   So that you are beside me.
GUIDO
   Ah!  There it is,
   I cannot be beside you, cannot breathe
   The air you breathe; I cannot any more
   Stand face to face with beauty, which unnerves
   My shaking heart, and makes my desperate hand
   Fail of its purpose.  Let me go hence, I pray;
   Forget you ever looked upon me.
DUCHESS
   What!
   With your hot kisses fresh upon my lips
   Forget the vows of love you made to me?
GUIDO
   I take them back.
DUCHESS
   Alas, you cannot, Guido,
   For they are part of nature now; the air
   Is tremulous with their music, and outside
   The little birds sing sweeter for those vows.
GUIDO
   There lies a barrier between us now,
   Which then I knew not, or I had forgot.
DUCHESS
   There is no barrier, Guido; why, I will go
   In poor attire, and will follow you
   Over the world.
GUIDO [_wildly_]
   The worlds not wide enough
   To hold us two!  Farewell, farewell for ever.
DUCHESS [_calm_, _and controlling her passion_]
   Why did you come into my life at all, then,
   Or in the desolate garden of my heart
   Sow that white flower of love?
GUIDO
   O Beatrice!
DUCHESS
   Which now you would dig up, uproot, tear out,
   Though each small fibre doth so hold my heart
   That if you break one, my heart breaks with it?
   Why did you come into my life?  Why open
   The secret wells of love I had sealed up?
   Why did you open them?
GUIDO
   O God!
DUCHESS [_clenching her hand_]
