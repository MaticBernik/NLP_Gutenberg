NORFOLK.
I am sorry
To hear this of him; and could wish he were
Something mistaken in't.
BUCKINGHAM.
No, not a syllable:
I do pronounce him in that very shape
He shall appear in proof.
[Enter Brandon, a Sergeant-at-arms before him,
and two or three of the Guard.]
BRANDON.  Your office, sergeant; execute it.
SERGEANT.
Sir,
My lord the Duke of Buckingham, and Earl
Of Hereford, Stafford, and Northampton, I
Arrest thee of high treason, in the name
Of our most sovereign king.
BUCKINGHAM.
Lo, you, my lord,
The net has fall'n upon me! I shall perish
Under device and practice.
BRANDON.
I am sorry
To see you ta'en from liberty, to look on
The business present.  'Tis his Highness' pleasure
You shall to the Tower.
BUCKINGHAM.
It will help nothing
To plead mine innocence; for that dye is on me
Which makes my whit'st part black. The will of Heaven
Be done in this and all things! I obey.
O my Lord Abergavenny, fare you well!
BRANDON.
Nay, he must bear you company.
[To Abergavenny.]  The King
Is pleas'd you shall to the Tower, till you know
How he determines further.
ABERGAVENNY.
As the Duke said,
The will of Heaven be done, and the King's pleasure
By me obey'd!
BRANDON.
Here is warrant from
The King to attach Lord Montacute, and the bodies
Of the Duke's confessor, John de la Car,
One Gilbert Peck, his chancellor,--
BUCKINGHAM.
So, so;
These are the limbs o' the plot.  No more, I hope?
BRANDON.
A monk o' the Chartreux.
BUCKINGHAM
O, Nicholas Hopkins?
BRANDON.
He.
BUCKINGHAM.
My surveyor is false; the o'er-great Cardinal
Hath show'd him gold; my life is spann'd already.
I am the shadow of poor Buckingham,
Whose figure even this instant cloud puts on,
By dark'ning my clear sun. My lord, farewell.
[Exeunt.]
SCENE II. The same. The council-chamber.
[Cornets. Enter the King, leaning on the Cardinal's shoulder,
the Nobles, and Sir Thomas Lovell; the Cardinal places himself
under the King's feet on his right side.]
KING.
My life itself, and the best heart of it,
Thanks you for this great care.  I stood i' the level
Of a full-charg'd confederacy, and give thanks
To you that chok'd it. Let be call'd before us
That gentleman of Buckingham's; in person
I'll hear his confessions justify;
And point by point the treasons of his master
He shall again relate.
[A noise within, crying "Room for the Queen!"  Enter Queen
Katherine, ushered by the Duke of Norfolk, and the Duke of
Suffolk; she kneels. The King riseth from his state, takes her
up, kisses and placeth her by him.]
QUEEN KATHERINE.
Nay, we must longer kneel; I am a suitor.
KING.
Arise, and take place by us. Half your suit
Never name to us, you have half our power;
The other moiety, ere you ask, is given.
Repeat your will and take it.
QUEEN KATHERINE.
Thank your Majesty.
That you would love yourself, and in that love
Not unconsidered leave your honour, nor
The dignity of your office, is the point
Of my petition.
