REGINA. [Mutters without looking at him.] You've said often enough I was
no concern of yours.
ENGSTRAND. Pooh! Why should you bother about that--
REGINA. Haven't you many a time sworn at me and called me a--? _Fi
donc_!
ENGSTRAND. Curse me, now, if ever I used such an ugly word.
REGINA. Oh, I remember very well what word you used.
ENGSTRAND. Well, but that was only when I was a bit on, don't you know?
Temptations are manifold in this world, Regina.
REGINA. Ugh!
ENGSTRAND. And besides, it was when your mother was that aggravating--I
had to find something to twit her with, my child. She was always setting
up for a fine lady. [Mimics.] "Let me go, Engstrand; let me be.
Remember I was three years in Chamberlain Alving's family at Rosenvold."
[Laughs.] Mercy on us! She could never forget that the Captain was made
a Chamberlain while she was in service here.
REGINA. Poor mother! you very soon tormented her into her grave.
ENGSTRAND. [With a twist of his shoulders.] Oh, of course! I'm to have
the blame for everything.
REGINA. [Turns away; half aloud.] Ugh--! And that leg too!
ENGSTRAND. What do you say, my child?
REGINA. _Pied de mouton_.
ENGSTRAND. Is that English, eh?
REGINA. Yes.
ENGSTRAND. Ay, ay; you've picked up some learning out here; and that may
come in useful now, Regina.
REGINA. [After a short silence.] What do you want with me in town?
ENGSTRAND. Can you ask what a father wants with his only child? A'n't I
a lonely, forlorn widower?
REGINA. Oh, don't try on any nonsense like that with me! Why do you want
me?
ENGSTRAND. Well, let me tell you, I've been thinking of setting up in a
new line of business.
REGINA. [Contemptuously.] You've tried that often enough, and much good
you've done with it.
ENGSTRAND. Yes, but this time you shall see, Regina! Devil take me--
REGINA. [Stamps.] Stop your swearing!
ENGSTRAND. Hush, hush; you're right enough there, my girl. What I wanted
to say was just this--I've laid by a very tidy pile from this Orphanage
job.
REGINA. Have you? That's a good thing for you.
ENGSTRAND. What can a man spend his ha'pence on here in this country
hole?
REGINA. Well, what then?
ENGSTRAND. Why, you see, I thought of putting the money into some paying
speculation. I thought of a sort of a sailor's tavern--
REGINA. Pah!
ENGSTRAND. A regular high-class affair, of course; not any sort of
pig-sty for common sailors. No! damn it! it would be for captains and
mates, and--and--regular swells, you know.
REGINA. And I was to--?
ENGSTRAND. You were to help, to be sure. Only for the look of the thing,
you understand. Devil a bit of hard work shall you have, my girl. You
shall do exactly what you like.
REGINA. Oh, indeed!
ENGSTRAND. But there must be a petticoat in the house; that's as clear
as daylight. For I want to have it a bit lively like in the evenings,
with singing and dancing, and so on. You must remember they're weary
wanderers on the ocean of life. [Nearer.] Now don't be a fool and
stand in your own light, Regina. What's to become of you out here? Your
mistress has given you a lot of learning; but what good is that to you?
You're to look after the children at the new Orphanage, I hear. Is that
the sort of thing for you, eh? Are you so dead set on wearing your life
out for a pack of dirty brats?
