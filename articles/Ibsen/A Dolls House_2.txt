_Mrs. Linde_. No?
_Nora_. You are just like all the others. They all think that I am
incapable of anything really serious--
_Mrs. Linde_. Come, come--
_Nora_.--that I have gone through nothing in this world of cares.
_Mrs. Linde_. But, my dear Nora, you have just told me all your
troubles.
_Nora_. Pooh!--those were trifles. (_Lowering her voice_.) I have not
told you the important thing.
_Mrs. Linde_. The important thing? What do you mean?
_Nora_. You look down upon me altogether, Christine--but you ought not
to. You are proud, aren't you, of having-worked so hard and so long for
your mother?
_Mrs. Linde_. Indeed, I don't look down on any one. But it is true that
I am both proud and glad to think that I was privileged to make the end
of my mother's life almost free from care.
_Nora_. And you are proud to think of what you have done for your
brothers.
_Mrs. Linde_. I think I have the right to be.
_Nora_. I think so, too. But now, listen to this; I too have something
to be proud and glad of.
_Mrs. Linde_. I have no doubt you have. But what do you refer to?
_Nora_. Speak low. Suppose Torvald were to hear! He mustn't on any
account--no one in the world must know, Christine, except you.
_Mrs. Linde_. But what is it?
_Nora_. Come here. (_Pulls her down on the sofa beside her_.) Now I will
show you that I too have something to be proud and glad of. It was I who
saved Torvald's life.
_Mrs. Linde_. "Saved"? How?
_Nora_. I told you about our trip to Italy. Torvald would never have
recovered if he had not gone there--
_Mrs. Linde_. Yes, but your father gave you the necessary funds.
_Nora_ (_smiling_). Yes, that is what Torvald and all the others think,
but--
_Mrs. Linde_. But.--
_Nora_. Papa didn't give us a shilling. It was I who procured the money.
_Mrs. Linde_. You? All that large sum?
_Nora_. Two hundred and fifty pounds. What do you think of that?
_Mrs. Linde_. But, Nora, how could you possibly do it? Did you win a
prize in the Lottery?
_Nora_ (_contemptuously_). In the Lottery? There would have been no
credit in that.
_Mrs. Linde_. But where did you get it from, then?
_Nora_ (_humming and smiling with an air of mystery_). Hm, hu! Aha!
_Mrs. Linde_. Because you couldn't have borrowed it.
_Nora_. Couldn't I? Why not?
_Mrs. Linde_. No, a wife cannot borrow without her husband's consent.
_Nora_ (_tossing her head_). Oh, if it is a wife who has any head for
business--a wife who has the wit to be a little bit clever--
_Mrs. Linde_. I don't understand it at all, Nora.
_Nora_. There is no need you should. I never said I had borrowed the
money. I may have got it some other way. (_Lies back on the sofa._)
Perhaps I got it from some other admirer. When anyone is as attractive
as I am--
