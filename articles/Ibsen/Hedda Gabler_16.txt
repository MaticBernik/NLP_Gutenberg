TESMAN.
Oh yes, yes--your news has quite upset me.
HEDDA.
[Reclining, holds out her hand.] Good-bye, Judge; and be sure you call
in the afternoon.
BRACK.
Many thanks. Good-bye, good-bye!
TESMAN.
[Accompanying him to the door.] Good-bye my dear Judge! You must really
excuse me-- [JUDGE BRACK goes out by the hall door.
TESMAN.
[Crosses the room.] Oh Hedda--one should never rush into adventures. Eh?
HEDDA.
[Looks at him, smiling.] Do you do that?
TESMAN.
Yes, dear--there is no denying--it was adventurous to go and marry and
set up house upon mere expectations.
HEDDA.
Perhaps you are right there.
TESMAN.
Well--at all events, we have our delightful home, Hedda! Fancy, the home
we both dreamed of--the home we were in love with, I may almost say. Eh?
HEDDA.
[Rising slowly and wearily.] It was part of our compact that we were to
go into society--to keep open house.
TESMAN.
Yes, if you only knew how I had been looking forward to it! Fancy--to
see you as hostess--in a select circle! Eh? Well, well, well--for the
present we shall have to get on without society, Hedda--only to invite
Aunt Julia now and then.--Oh, I intended you to lead such an utterly
different life, dear--!
HEDDA.
Of course I cannot have my man in livery just yet.
TESMAN.
Oh, no, unfortunately. It would be out of the question for us to keep a
footman, you know.
HEDDA.
And the saddle-horse I was to have had--
TESMAN.
[Aghast.] The saddle-horse!
HEDDA.
--I suppose I must not think of that now.
TESMAN.
Good heavens, no!--that's as clear as daylight!
HEDDA.
[Goes up the room.] Well, I shall have one thing at least to kill time
with in the meanwhile.
TESMAN.
[Beaming.] Oh thank heaven for that! What is it, Hedda. Eh?
HEDDA.
[In the middle doorway, looks at him with covert scorn.] My pistols,
George.
TESMAN.
[In alarm.] Your pistols!
HEDDA.
[With cold eyes.] General Gabler's pistols.
   [She goes out through the inner room, to the left.
TESMAN.
[Rushes up to the middle doorway and calls after her:] No, for heaven's
sake, Hedda darling--don't touch those dangerous things! For my sake
Hedda! Eh?
ACT SECOND.
  The room at the TESMANS' as in the first Act, except that the
  piano has been removed, and an elegant little writing-table
  with the book-shelves put in its place.  A smaller table
  stands near the sofa on the left.  Most of the bouquets have
  been taken away.  MRS. ELVSTED'S bouquet is upon the large
  table in front.--It is afternoon.
  HEDDA, dressed to receive callers, is alone in the room. She
  stands by the open glass door, loading a revolver.  The
  fellow to it lies in an open pistol-case on the writing-
  table.
HEDDA.
[Looks down the garden, and calls:] So you are here again, Judge!
BRACK.
[Is heard calling from a distance.] As you see, Mrs. Tesman!
HEDDA.
[Raises the pistol and points.] Now I'll shoot you, Judge Brack!
BRACK.
[Calling unseen.] No, no, no! Don't stand aiming at me!
