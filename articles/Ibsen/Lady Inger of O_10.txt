  LADY INGER (looks out).  It is a knight and his attendant.  They
are dismounting in the courtyard.
  OLAF SKAKTAVL.  Then it is he.  His name?
  LADY INGER.  You know not his name?
  OLAF SKAKTAVL.  Peter Kanzler refused to tell it me.  He would
only say that I should find him at Ostrat the third evening after
Martinmas----
  LADY INGER.  Ay; even to-night.
  OLAF SKAKTAVL.  He was to bring letters with him, and from them,
and from you, I was to learn who he is.
  LADY INGER.  Then let me lead you to your chamber.  You have
need of rest and refreshment.  You shall soon have speech with
the stranger.
  OLAF SKAKTAVL.  Well, be it as you will.  (Both go out to the left.)
    (After a short pause, FINN enters cautiously through the door
      on the right, looks round the room, and peeps into the Banquet
      Hall; he then goes back to the door, and makes a sign to some
      one outside.  Immediately after, enter COUNCILLOR NILS LYKKE
      and the Swedish Commander, JENS BIELKE.)
  NILS LYKKE (softly).  No one?
  FINN (in the same tone).  No one, master!
  NILS LYKKE.  And we may depend on you in all things?
  FINN.  The commandant in Trondhiem has ever given me a name for
trustiness.
  NILS LYKKE.  It is well; he has said as much to me.  First
of all, then--has there come any stranger to Ostrat to-night,
before us?
  FINN.  Ay; a stranger came an hour since.
  NILS LYKKE (softly, to JENS BIELKE).  He is here.  (Turns again
to FINN.)  Would you know him again?  Have you seen him?
  FINN.  Nay, none have seen him, that I know, but the gatekeeper.
He was brought at once to Lady Inger, and she----
  NILS LYKKE.  Well?  What of her?  He is not gone again already?
  FINN.  No; but it seems she keeps him hidden in one of her own
rooms; for----
  NILS LYKKE.  It is well.
  JENS BIELKE (whispers).  Then the first thing is to put a guard
on the gate; then we are sure of him.
  NILS LYKKE (with a smile).  Hm!  (To FINN.)  Tell me--is there
any way of leaving the castle but by the gate?  Gape not at me so!
I mean--can one escape from Ostrat unseen, while the castle gate
is shut?
  FINN.  Nay, that I know not.  'Tis true they talk of secret ways
in the vaults beneath; but no one knows them save Lady Inger--and
mayhap Mistress Elina.
  JENS BIELKE.  The devil!
  NILS LYKKE.  It is well.  You may go.
  FINN.  And should you need me in aught again, you have but to
open the second door on the right in the Banquet Hall, and I shall
presently be at hand.
  NILS LYKKE.  Good.  (Points to the entrance-door.  FINN goes out.)
  JENS BIELKE.  Now, by my soul, dear friend and brother--this
campaign is like to end but scurvily for both of us.
  NILS LYKKE (with a smile).  Oh--not for me, I hope.
  JENS BIELKE.  Not?  First of all, there is small honour to be
got in hunting an overgrown whelp like this Nils Sture.  Are we
to think him mad or in his sober senses after the pranks he has
played?  First he breeds bad blood among the peasants; promises
them help and all their hearts can desire;--and then, when it
comes to the pinch, off he runs to hide behind a petticoat!
  Moreover, to tell the truth, I repent that I followed your
counsel and went not my own way.
