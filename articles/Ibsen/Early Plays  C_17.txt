FURIA.  Now we can never part!
CATILINE.  Ah, like a stream
Of fire your touch went coursing through my veins!
'Tis blood no more that flows, but fiery flames;--
My breast now cabins and confines my heart;
My sight grows dull.  Soon shall a flaming sea
Illumine with its light the Roman state!
[He draws his sword and brandishes it.]
CATILINE.  My sword!  My sword!  Do you see how it flashes?
Soon will it redden in their tepid blood!--
What change is this in me?  My brow burns hot;
A multitude of visions flit before me.--
Vengeance it is,--triumph for all those dreams
Of greatness, regal power, and lasting fame.
My watch-word shall be: livid flames and death!
The capitol!  Now first I am myself!
[He rushes out; FURIA follows him.]
                *       *       *       *       *
[The inside of a dimly illumined tavern.]
[STATILIUS, GABINIUS, COEPARIUS, and other young
ROMANS enter.]
STATILIUS.  Here, comrades, we can while away the night;
Here we are safe; no one will overhear us.
GABINIUS.  Ah, yes; now let us drink, carouse, enjoy!
Who knows how long it will be granted us?
STATILIUS.  No, let us first await whatever tidings
Lentulus and Cethegus have for us.
GABINIUS.  Bah, let them bring whatever news they will!
Meanwhile the wine is here; come, let us taste.
Quick, brothers, quick,--let's have a merry song!
[SERVANTS bring in wine and glasses.]
THE ASSEMBLED FRIENDS.  (Sing.)
  Bacchus, all praise to thee!
  Joyful we raise to thee
  Brimful the beaker!
  Hail to thee, hail!
  Wine, red and glowing,
  Merrily flowing,
  Drink of the wine-god,--
  This be our song.
  Gracious and friendly
  Smiles father Liber;
  Drunkenness waits us;
  Clear is the wine.
  Come, do not tarry!
  Wine will make merry,
  Joyful and airy,
  Body and soul.
  Thou above all the
  Glittering bubbles,
  Sparkling Falernian,
  Glorious drink!
  Courage and power,
  These are your dower.
  Gladsome the gift you
  Bring to the soul.
  Bacchus, all praise to thee!
  Joyful we raise to thee
  Brimful the beaker!
  Hail to thee, hail!
  Wine, red and glowing,
  Merrily flowing,
  Drink of the wine-god,--
  This be our song.
[LENTULUS and CETHEGUS enter.]
LENTULUS.  Cease all your song and merriment!
STATILIUS.  What now?
Is Catiline not in your company?
GABINIUS.  Surely he was quite willing?
COEPARIUS.  Come, say forth!
What was his answer?
CETHEGUS.  Ah, quite otherwise
Than we expected was his answer.
GABINIUS.  Well?
LENTULUS.  Well, all of our proposals he declined;--
He would not even hearken to our counsels.
STATILIUS.  Is this the truth?
COEPARIUS.  And wherefore would he not?
LENTULUS.  In short, he will not.  He forsakes his friends,--
Abandons us,--and leaves the city.
STATILIUS.  What?
He leaves, you say?
CETHEGUS.  'Tis true;--he goes away
This very night.  Yet,--blamed he can not be;
His ground was valid--
LENTULUS.  Fear was his excuse!
In danger he forsakes us faithlessly.
GABINIUS.  That is the friendship of our Catiline!
COEPARIUS.  Never was Catiline faithless or afraid!
LENTULUS.  And yet he leaves us now.
STATILIUS.  Our hopes go with him.
Where's now the man to take the leadership?
