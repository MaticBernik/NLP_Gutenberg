ERHART.
  Yes, indeed, my dear Aunt; I can't think of going.  [Looking
doubtfully at MRS. WILTON.]  But how shall we manage?  Can I get
out of it?  You have said "Yes" for me, haven't you?
MRS. WILTON.
  [Gaily.]  What nonsense!  Not get out of it!  When I make my
entrance into the festive halls--just imagine it!--deserted and
forlorn--then I must simply say "No" for you.
ERHART.
  [Hesitatingly.]  Well, if you really think I can get out of
it----
MRS. WILTON.
  [Putting the matter lightly aside.]  I am quite used to saying
both yes and no--on my own account.  And you can't possibly think
of leaving your aunt the moment she has arrived!  For shame,
Monsieur Erhart!  Would that be behaving like a good son?
MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Annoyed.]  Son?
MRS. WILTON.
  Well, adopted son then, Mrs. Borkman.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  Yes, you may well add that.
MRS. WILTON.
  Oh, it seems to me we have often more cause to be grateful to
a foster-mother than to our own mother.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  Has that been your experience?
MRS. WILTON.
  I knew very little of my own mother, I am sorry to say.  But if
I had had a good foster-mother, perhaps I shouldn't have been so--
so naughty, as people say I am.  [Turning towards ERHART.]  Well,
then we stop peaceably at home like a good boy, and drink tea
with mamma and auntie!  [To the ladies.]  Good-bye, good-bye Mrs.
Borkman!  Good-bye Miss Rentheim.
    [The ladies bow silently.  She goes toward the door.
ERHART.
  [Following her.]  Shan't I go a little bit of the way with you?
MRS. WILTON.
  [In the doorway, motioning him back.]  You shan't go a step
with me.  I am quite accustomed to taking my walks alone.  [Stops
on the threshold, looks at him and nods.]  But now beware, Mr.
Borkman--I warn you!
ERHART.
  What am I to beware of?
MRS. WILTON.
  [Gaily.]  Why, as I go down the road--deserted and forlorn, as
I said before--I shall try if I can't cast a spell upon you.
ERHART.
  [Laughing.]  Oh, indeed!  Are you going to try that again?
MRS. WILTON.
  [Half seriously.]  Yes, just you beware!  As I go down the road,
I will say in my own mind--right from the very centre of my will--
I will say: "Mr. Erhart Borkman, take your hat at once!"
MRS. BORKMAN.
  And you think he will take it?
MRS. WILTON.
  [Laughing.]  Good heavens, yes, he'll snatch up his hat
instantly.  And then I will say: "Now put on your overcoat, like
a good boy, Erhart Borkman!  And your goloshes!  Be sure you don't
forget the goloshes!  And then follow me!  Do as I bid you, as I
bid you, as I bid you!"
ERHART.
  [With forced gaiety.]  Oh, you may rely on that.
MRS. WILTON.
  [Raising her forefinger.]  As I bid you!  As I bid you!
Good-night!
    [She laughs and nods to the ladies, and closes the door
        behind her.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  Does she really play tricks of that sort?
ERHART.
  Oh, not at all.  How can you think so!  She only says it in fun.
[Breaking off.]  But don't let us talk about Mrs. Wilton.  [He
forces ELLA RENTHEIM to seat herself at the armchair beside the
stove, then stands and looks at her.]  To think of your having
taken all this long journey, Aunt Ella!  And in winter too!
