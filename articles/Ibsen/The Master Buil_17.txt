SOLNESS.
[Pondering a little.] Strange that you should say that--for that is just
what I am most anxious to do.
HILDA.
[Impatiently.] Why don't you do it, then?
SOLNESS.
[Shakes his head.] No, the people will not have it.
HILDA.
Fancy their not wanting it!
SOLNESS.
[More lightly.] But now I am building a new home for myself--just
opposite here.
HILDA.
For yourself?
SOLNESS.
Yes. It is almost finished. And on that there is a tower.
HILDA.
A high tower?
SOLNESS.
Yes.
HILDA.
Very high?
SOLNESS.
No doubt people will say it is too high--too high for a dwelling-house.
HILDA.
I'll go out to look at that tower first thing to-morrow morning.
SOLNESS.
[Sits resting his cheek on his hand, and gazes at her.] Tell me, Miss
Wangel--what is your name? Your Christian name, I mean.
HILDA.
Why, Hilda, of course.
SOLNESS.
[As before.] Hilda? Indeed?
HILDA.
Don't you remember that? You called me Hilda yourself--that day when you
misbehaved.
SOLNESS.
Did I really.
HILDA.
But then you said "little Hilda"; and I didn't like that.
SOLNESS.
Oh, you didn't like that, Miss Hilda?
HILDA.
No, not at such a time as that. But--"Princess Hilda"--that will sound
very well, I think.
SOLNESS.
Very well indeed. Princess Hilda of--of--what was to be the name of the
kingdom?
HILDA.
Pooh! I won't have anything to do with that stupid kingdom. I have set
my heart upon quite a different one!
SOLNESS.
[Has leaned back in the chair, still gazing at her.] Isn't it strange--?
The more I think of it now, the more it seems to me as though I had gone
about all these years torturing myself with--h'm--
HILDA.
With what?
SOLNESS.
With the effort to recover something--some experience, which I seemed to
have forgotten. But I never had the least inkling of what it could be.
HILDA.
You should have tied a knot in your pocket-handkerchief, Mr. Solness.
SOLNESS.
In that case, I should simply have had to go racking my brains to
discover what the knot could mean.
HILDA.
Oh yes, I suppose there are trolls of that kind in the world, too.
SOLNESS.
[Rises slowly.] What a good thing it is that you have come to me now.
HILDA.
[Looks deeply into his eyes.] Is it a good thing!
SOLNESS.
For I have been so lonely here. I have been gazing so helplessly at it
all. [In a lower voice.] I must tell you--I have begun to be afraid of
the younger generation.
HILDA.
[With a little snort of contempt.] Pooh--is the younger generation
something to be afraid of?
SOLNESS.
It is indeed. And that is why I have locked and barred myself in.
[Mysteriously.] I tell you the younger generation will one day come and
thunder at my door! They will break in upon me!
HILDA.
Then I should say you ought to go out and open the door to the younger
generation.
SOLNESS.
Open the door?
HILDA.
Yes. Let them come in to you on friendly terms, as it were.
