ASTA. [Following him and holding him back.] Alfred--Alfred! Don't go to
the fiord.
ALLMERS. I must go out to him! Let me go, Asta! I will take the boat.
ASTA. [In terror.] Don't go to the fiord, I say!
ALLMERS. [Yielding.] No, no--I will not. Only let me alone.
ASTA. [Leading him back to the table.] You must rest from your thoughts,
Alfred. Come here and sit down.
ALLMERS. [Making as if to seat himself on the bench.] Well, well--as you
please.
ASTA. No, I won't let you sit there.
ALLMERS. Yes, let me.
ASTA. No, don't. For then you will only sit looking out--[Forces him
down upon a chair, with his back to the right.] There now. Now that's
right. [Seats herself upon the bench.] And now we can talk a little
again.
ALLMERS. [Drawing a deep breath audibly.] It was good to deaden the
sorrow and heartache for a moment.
ASTA. You insist do so, Alfred.
ALLMERS. But don't you think it is terribly weak and unfeeling of me--to
be able to do so?
ASTA. Oh, no--I am sure it is impossible to keep circling for ever round
one fixed thought.
ALLMERS. Yes, for me it is impossible. Before you came to me, here I
sat, torturing myself unspeakably with this crushing, gnawing sorrow--
ASTA. Yes?
ALLMERS. And would you believe it, Asta--? H'm--
ASTA. Well?
ALLMERS. In the midst of all the agony, I found myself speculating what
we should have for dinner to-day.
ASTA. [Soothingly.] Well, well, if only it rests you to--
ALLMERS. Yes, just fancy, dear--it seemed as if it did give me rest.
[Holds out, his hand to her across the table.] How good it is, Asta,
that I have you with me. I am so glad of that. Glad, glad--even in my
sorrow.
ASTA. [Looking earnestly at him.] You ought most of all to be glad that
you have Rita.
ALLMERS. Yes, of course I should. But Rita is no kin to me--it isn't
like having a sister.
ASTA. [Eagerly.] Do you say that, Alfred?
ALLMERS. Yes, our family is a thing apart. [Half jestingly.] We have
always had vowels for our initials. Don't you remember how often we used
to speak of that? And all our relations--all equally poor. And we have
all the same colour of eyes.
ASTA. Do you think I have--?
ALLMERS. No, you take entirely after your mother. You are not in the
least like the rest of us--not even like father. But all the same--
ASTA. All the same--?
ALLMERS. Well, I believe that living together has, as it were, stamped
us in each other's image--mentally, I mean.
ASTA. [With warm emotion.] Oh, you must never say that, Alfred. It is
only I that have taken my stamp from you; and it is to you that I owe
everything--every good thing in the world.
ALLMERS. [Shaking his head.] You owe me nothing, Asta. On the contrary--
ASTA. I owe you everything! You must never doubt that. No sacrifice has
been too great for you--
