[PASTOR MANDERS, wearing an overcoat, carrying an umbrella, and with
a small travelling-bag on a strap over his shoulder, comes through the
garden door into the conservatory.]
MANDERS. Good-morning, Miss Engstrand.
REGINA. [Turning round, surprised and pleased.] No, really! Good
morning, Pastor Manders. Is the steamer in already?
MANDERS. It is just in. [Enters the sitting-room.] Terrible weather we
have been having lately.
REGINA. [Follows him.] It's such blessed weather for the country, sir.
MANDERS. No doubt; you are quite right. We townspeople give too little
thought to that. [He begins to take of his overcoat.]
REGINA. Oh, mayn't I help you?--There! Why, how wet it is? I'll just
hang it up in the hall. And your umbrella, too--I'll open it and let it
dry.
[She goes out with the things through the second door on the right.
PASTOR MANDERS takes off his travelling bag and lays it and his hat on a
chair. Meanwhile REGINA comes in again.]
MANDERS. Ah, it's a comfort to get safe under cover. I hope everything
is going on well here?
REGINA. Yes, thank you, sir.
MANDERS. You have your hands full, I suppose, in preparation for
to-morrow?
REGINA. Yes, there's plenty to do, of course.
MANDERS. And Mrs. Alving is at home, I trust?
REGINA. Oh dear, yes. She's just upstairs, looking after the young
master's chocolate.
MANDERS. Yes, by-the-bye--I heard down at the pier that Oswald had
arrived.
REGINA. Yes, he came the day before yesterday. We didn't expect him
before to-day.
MANDERS. Quite strong and well, I hope?
REGINA. Yes, thank you, quite; but dreadfully tired with the journey. He
has made one rush right through from Paris--the whole way in one train,
I believe. He's sleeping a little now, I think; so perhaps we'd better
talk a little quietly.
MANDERS. Sh!--as quietly as you please.
REGINA. [Arranging an arm-chair beside the table.] Now, do sit down,
Pastor Manders, and make yourself comfortable. [He sits down; she places
a footstool under his feet.] There! Are you comfortable now, sir?
MANDERS. Thanks, thanks, extremely so. [Looks at her.] Do you know, Miss
Engstrand, I positively believe you have grown since I last saw you.
REGINA. Do you think so, Sir? Mrs. Alving says I've filled out too.
MANDERS. Filled out? Well, perhaps a little; just enough.
[Short pause.]
REGINA. Shall I tell Mrs. Alving you are here?
MANDERS. Thanks, thanks, there is no hurry, my dear child.--By-the-bye,
Regina, my good girl, tell me: how is your father getting on out here?
REGINA. Oh, thank you, sir, he's getting on well enough.
MANDERS. He called upon me last time he was in town.
REGINA. Did he, indeed? He's always so glad of a chance of talking to
you, sir.
MANDERS. And you often look in upon him at his work, I daresay?
REGINA. I? Oh, of course, when I have time, I--
MANDERS. Your father is not a man of strong character, Miss Engstrand.
He stands terribly in need of a guiding hand.
