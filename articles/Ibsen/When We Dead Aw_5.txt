THE INSPECTOR.
[Stops.] I am not scuttling at all, Mr. Ulfheim.
    [ULFHEIM enters from the left followed by a servant with a
       couple of sporting dogs in leash.  ULFHEIM is in shooting
       costume, with high boots and a felt hat with a feather in
       it.  He is a long, lank, sinewy personage, with matted hair
       and beard, and a loud voice.  His appearance gives no precise
       clue to his age, but he is no longer young.]
ULFHEIM.
[Pounces upon the INSPECTOR.] Is this a way to receive strangers, hey?
You scamper away with your tail between your legs--as if you had the
devil at your heels.
THE INSPECTOR.
[Calmly, without answering him.] Has Mr. Ulfheim arrived by the steamer?
ULFHEIM.
[Growls.] Haven't had the honour of seeing any steamer. [With his arms
akimbo.] Don't you know that I sail my own cutter? [To the SERVANT.]
Look well after your fellow-creatures, Lars. But take care you keep them
ravenous, all the same. Fresh meat-bones--but not too much meat on them,
do you hear? And be sure it's reeking raw, and bloody. And get something
in your own belly while you're about it. [Aiming a kick at him.] Now
then, go to hell with you!
    [The SERVANT goes out with the dogs, behind the corner of the
       hotel.]
THE INSPECTOR.
Would not Mr. Ulfheim like to go into the dining-room in the meantime?
ULFHEIM.
In among all the half-dead flies and people? No, thank you a thousand
times, Mr. Inspector.
THE INSPECTOR.
Well, well, as you please.
ULFHEIM.
But get the housekeeper to prepare a hamper for me as usual. There must
be plenty of provender in it--and lots of brandy--! You can tell her
that I or Lars will come and play Old Harry with her if she doesn't--
THE INSPECTOR.
[Interrupting.] We know your ways of old. [Turning.] Can I give the
waiter any orders, Professor? Can I send Mrs. Rubek anything?
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
No thank you; nothing for me.
MAIA.
Nor for me.
    [The INSPECTOR goes into the hotel.
ULFHEIM.
[Stares at them for a moment; then lifts his hat.] Why, blast me if here
isn't a country tyke that has strayed into regular tip-top society.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Looking up.] What do you mean by that, Mr. Ulfheim?
ULFHEIM.
[More quietly and politely.] I believe I have the honour of addressing
no less a person than the great Sculptor Rubek.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Nods.] I remember meeting you once or twice--the autumn when I was last
at home.
ULFHEIM.
That's many years ago, now. And then you weren't so illustrious as I
hear you've since become. At that time even a dirty bear-hunter might
venture to come near you.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Smiling.] I don't bite even now.
MAIA.
[Looks with interest at ULFHEIM.] Are you really and truly a
bear-hunter?
ULFHEIM.
[Seating himself at the next table, nearer the hotel.] A bear-hunter
when I have the chance, madam. But I make the best of any sort of game
that comes in my way--eagles, and wolves, and women, and elks, and
reindeer--if only it's fresh and juicy and has plenty of blood in it.
