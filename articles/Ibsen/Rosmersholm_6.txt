Brendel. My audience is moved. That refreshes my heart and strengthens
my will--and now I shall proceed upon my task forthwith. There is one
other point, though. (To KROLL.) Can you inform me, sir, whether there
is an Abstainers' Society in the town? A Total Abstainers' Society? I
feel sure there must be.
Kroll. There is one, at your service. I am the president.
Brendel. I could tell that as soon as I saw you! Well, it is not at all
impossible that I may come to you and become a member for a week.
Kroll. Excuse me--we do not accept weekly members.
Brendel. A la bonne heure, my good sir. Ulrik Brendel has never been in
the habit of forcing himself upon societies of that kind. (Turns to go)
But I must not prolong my stay in this house, rich as it is in
memories. I must go into the town and find some suitable lodging. I
shall find a decent hotel of some kind there, I hope?
Rebecca. Will you not have something hot to drink before you go?
Brendel. Of what nature, dear lady?
Rebecca. A cup of tea, or--
Brendel. A thousand thanks to the most generous of hostesses!--but I do
not like trespassing on private hospitality. (Waves his hand.) Good-bye
to you all! (Goes to the door, but turns back.) Oh, by the
way--John--Mr. Rosmer--will you do your former tutor a service for old
friendship's sake?
Rosmer. With the greatest of pleasure.
Brendel. Good. Well, then, lend me--just for a day or two--a starched
shirt.
Rosmer. Nothing more than that!
Brendel. Because, you see, I am travelling on foot--on this occasion.
My trunk is being sent after me.
Rosmer. Quite so. But, in that case, isn't there anything else?
Brendel. Well, I will tell you what--perhaps you have an old, worn-out
summer coat that you could spare?
Rosmer. Certainly I have.
Brendel. And if there happened to be a pair of presentable shoes that
would go with the coat.
Rosmer. I am sure we can manage that, too. As soon as you let us know
your address, we will send the things to you.
Brendel. Please don't think of it! No one must be put to any
inconvenience on my account! I will take the trifles with me.
Rosmer. Very well. Will you come upstairs with me, then?
Rebecca. Let me go. Mrs. Helseth and I will see about it.
Brendel. I could never think of allowing this charming lady--
Rebecca. Nonsense! Come along, Mr. Brendel. (She goes out by the door
on the right.)
Rosmer (holding BRENDEL back). Tell me--is there no other way I can be
of service to you?
Brendel. I am sure I do not know of any. Yes, perdition seize it!--now
that I come to think of it--John, do you happen to have seven or eight
shillings on you?
Rosmer. I will see. (Opens his purse.) I have two half-sovereigns here.
Brendel. Oh, well, never mind. I may as well take them. I can always
get change in town. Thanks, in the meantime. Remember that it was two
half-sovereigns I had. Good-night, my own dear boy! Good-night to you,
sir! (Goes out by the door on the right, where ROSMER takes leave of
him and shuts the door after him.)
