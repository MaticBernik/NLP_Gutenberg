TESMAN.
Has it indeed? It must be something he has had lying by since his better
days.
MRS. ELVSTED.
Long ago, you mean?
TESMAN.
Yes.
MRS. ELVSTED.
No, he has written it all since he has been with us--within the last
year.
TESMAN.
Isn't that good news, Hedda? Think of that.
MRS. ELVSTED.
Ah yes, if only it would last!
HEDDA.
Have you seen him here in town?
MRS. ELVSTED.
No, not yet. I have had the greatest difficulty in finding out his
address. But this morning I discovered it at last.
HEDDA.
[Looks searchingly at her.] Do you know, it seems to me a little odd of
your husband--h'm--
MRS. ELVSTED.
[Starting nervously.] Of my husband! What?
HEDDA.
That he should send you to town on such an errand--that he does not come
himself and look after his friend.
MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh no, no--my husband has no time. And besides, I--I had some shopping
to do.
HEDDA.
[With a slight smile.] Ah, that is a different matter.
MRS. ELVSTED.
[Rising quickly and uneasily.] And now I beg and implore you, Mr.
Tesman--receive Eilert Lovborg kindly if he comes to you! And that he
is sure to do. You see you were such great friends in the old days.
And then you are interested in the same studies--the same branch of
science--so far as I can understand.
TESMAN.
We used to be at any rate.
MRS. ELVSTED.
That is why I beg so earnestly that you--you too--will keep a sharp eye
upon him. Oh, you will promise me that, Mr. Tesman--won't you?
TESMAN.
With the greatest of pleasure, Mrs. Rysing--
HEDDA.
Elvsted.
TESMAN.
I assure you I shall do all I possibly can for Eilert. You may rely upon
me.
MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh, how very, very kind of you! [Presses his hands.] Thanks, thanks,
thanks! [Frightened.] You see, my husband is so very fond of him!
HEDDA.
[Rising.] You ought to write to him, Tesman. Perhaps he may not care to
come to you of his own accord.
TESMAN.
Well, perhaps it would be the right thing to do, Hedda? Eh?
HEDDA.
And the sooner the better. Why not at once?
MRS. ELVSTED.
[Imploringly.] Oh, if you only would!
TESMAN.
I'll write this moment. Have you his address, Mrs.--Mrs. Elvsted.
MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes. [Takes a slip of paper from her pocket, and hands it to him.] Here
it is.
TESMAN.
Good, good. Then I'll go in-- [Looks about him.] By-the-bye,--my
slippers? Oh, here. [Takes the packet and is about to go.
HEDDA.
Be sure you write him a cordial, friendly letter. And a good long one
too.
TESMAN.
Yes, I will.
MRS. ELVSTED.
But please, please don't say a word to show that I have suggested it.
TESMAN.
No, how could you think I would? Eh?
     [He goes out to the right, through the inner room.
HEDDA.
[Goes up to MRS. ELVSTED, smiles, and says in a low voice.] There! We
have killed two birds with one stone.
MRS. ELVSTED.
