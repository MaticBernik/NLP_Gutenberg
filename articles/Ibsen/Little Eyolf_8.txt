ALLMERS. [Shaking hands with him.] Yes, I arrived list night.
RITA. [Gaily.] His leave was up, Mr. Borgheim.
ALLMERS. No, you know it wasn't, Rita--
RITA. [Approaching.] Oh yes, but it was, though. His furlough had run
out.
BORGHEIM. I see you hold your husband well in hand, Mrs. Allmers.
RITA. I hold to my rights. And besides, everything must have an end.
BORGHEIM. Oh, not everything--I hope. Good morning, Miss Allmers!
ASTA. [Holding aloof from him.] Good morning.
RITA. [Looking at BORGHEIM.] Not everything, you say?
BORGHEIM. Oh, I am firmly convinced that there are some things in the
world that will never come to an end.
RITA. I suppose you are thinking of love--and that sort of thing.
BORGHEIM. [Warmly.] I am thinking of all that is lovely!
RITA. And that never comes to an end. Yes, let us think of that, hope
for that, all of us.
ALLMERS. [Coming up to them.] I suppose you will soon have finished your
road-work out here?
BORGHEIM. I have finished it already--finished it yesterday. It has been
a long business, but, thank Heaven, that has come to an end.
RITA. And you are beaming with joy over that?
BORGHEIM. Yes, I am indeed!
RITA. Well, I must say--
BORGHEIM. What, Mrs. Allmers?
RITA. I don't think it is particularly nice of you, Mr. Borgheim.
BORGHEIM. Indeed! Why not?
RITA. Well, I suppose we sha'n't often see you in these parts after
this.
BORGHEIM. No, that is true. I hadn't thought of that.
RITA. Oh well, I suppose you will be able to look in upon us now and
then all the same.
BORGHEIM. No, unfortunately that will be out of my power for a very long
time.
ALLMERS. Indeed! How so?
BORGHEIM. The fact is, I have got a big piece of new work that I must
set about at once.
ALLMERS. Have you indeed?--[Pressing his hand.]--I am heartily glad to
hear it.
RITA. I congratulate you, Mr. Borgheim!
BORGHEIM. Hush, hush--I really ought not to talk openly of it as
yet! But I can't help coming out with it! It is a great piece of
road-making--up in the north--with mountain ranges to cross, and
the most tremendous difficulties to overcome!--[With an outburst of
gladness.]--Oh, what a glorious world this is--and what a joy it is to
be a road-maker in it!
RITA. [Smiling, and looking teasingly at him.] Is it road-making
business that has brought you out here to-day in such wild spirits?
BORGHEIM. No, not that alone. I am thinking of all the bright and
hopeful prospects that are opening out before me.
RITA. Aha, then perhaps you have something still more exquisite in
reserve!
BORGHEIM. [Glancing towards ASTA.] Who knows! When once happiness comes
to us, it is apt to come like it spring flood. [Turns to ASTA.] Miss
Allmers, would you not like to take a little walk with me? As we used
to?
ASTA. [Quickly.] No--no, thank you. Not now. Not to-day.
BORGHEIM. Oh, do come! Only a little bit of a walk! I have so much I
want to talk to you about before I go.
