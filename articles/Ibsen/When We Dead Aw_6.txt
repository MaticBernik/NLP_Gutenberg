    [Drinks from his pocket-flask.
MAIA.
[Regarding him fixedly.] But you like bear-hunting best?
ULFHEIM.
I like it best, yes. For then one can have the knife handy at a pinch.
[With a slight smile.] We both work in a hard material, madam--both your
husband and I. He struggles with his marble blocks, I daresay; and I
struggle with tense and quivering bear-sinews. And we both of us win
the fight in the end--subdue and master our material. We never rest till
we've got the upper hand of it, though it fight never so hard.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Deep in thought.] There's a great deal of truth in what you say.
ULFHEIM.
Yes, for I take it the stone has something to fight for too. It is dead,
and determined by no manner of means to let itself be hammered into
life. Just like the bear when you come and prod him up in his lair.
MAIA.
Are you going up into the forests now to hunt?
ULFHEIM.
I am going right up into the high mountain.--I suppose you have never
been in the high mountain, madam?
MAIA.
No, never.
ULFHEIM.
Confound it all then, you must be sure and come up there this very
summer! I'll take you with me--both you and the Professor, with
pleasure.
MAIA.
Thanks. But Rubek is thinking of taking a sea trip this summer.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Round the coast--through the island channels.
ULFHEIM.
Ugh--what the devil would you do in those damnable sickly
gutters--floundering about in the brackish ditchwater? Dishwater I
should rather call it.
MAIA.
There, you hear, Rubek!
ULFHEIM.
No, much better come up with me to the mountain--away, clean away, from
the trail and taint of men. You cant' think what that means for me. But
such a little lady--
    [He stops.
    [The SISTER OF MERCY comes out of the pavilion and goes into
       the hotel.
ULFHEIM.
[Following her with his eyes.] Just look at her, do! That night-crow
there!--Who is it that's to be buried?
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
I have not heard of any one--
ULFHEIM.
Well, there's some one on the point of giving up the ghost, then--in on
corner or another.--People that are sickly and rickety should have the
goodness to see about getting themselves buried--the sooner the better.
MAIA.
Have you ever been ill yourself, Mr. Ulfheim.
ULFHEIM.
Never. If I had, I shouldn't be here.--But my nearest friends--they have
been ill, poor things.
MAIA.
And what did you do for your nearest friends?
ULFHEIM.
Shot them, of course.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Looking at him.] Shot them?
MAIA.
[Moving her chair back.] Shot them dead?
ULFHEIM.
[Nods.] I never miss, madam.
MAIA.
But how can you possibly shoot people!
ULFHEIM.
I am not speaking of people--
MAIA.
You said your nearest friends--
ULFHEIM.
Well, who should they be but my dogs?
MAIA.
Are your dogs your nearest friends?
ULFHEIM.
I have none nearer. My honest, trusty, absolutely loyal comrades--. When
one of them turns sick and miserable--bang!--and there's my friend sent
packing--to the other world.
