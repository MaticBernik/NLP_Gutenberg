MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Scornfully.]  Do you think I ever ask about that?
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Ask?  Surely you do not require to ask----
MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Looks at her in surprise.]  You don't suppose I ever have
anything to do with him?  That I ever meet him?  That I see
anything of him?
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Not even that!
MRS. BORKMAN.
  [As before.]  The man was in gaol, in gaol for five years!
[Covers her face with her hands.]  Oh, the crushing shame of it!
[With increased vehemence.]  And then to think of all that the
name of John Gabriel Borkman used to mean!  No, no, no--I can
never see him again!  Never!
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Looks at her for a while.]  You have a hard heart, Gunhild.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  Towards him, yes.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  After all, he is your husband.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  Did he not say in court that it was I who began his ruin?  That
I spent money so recklessly?
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Tentatively.]  But is there not some truth in that?
MRS. BORKMAN.
  Why, it was he himself that made me do it!  He insisted on our
living in such an absurdly lavish style----
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Yes, I know.  But that is just where you should have restrained
him; and apparently you didn't.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  How was I to know that it was not his own money he gave me to
squander?  And that he himself used to squander, too--ten times
more than I did!
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Quietly.]  Well, I daresay his position forced him to do that--
to some extent at any rate.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Scornfully.]  Yes, it was always the same story--we were to
"cut a figure."  And he did "cut a figure" to some purpose!  He
used to drive about with a four-in-hand as if he were a king.
And he had people bowing and scraping to him just as to a king.
[With a laugh.]  And they always called him by his Christian
names--all the country over--as if he had been the king himself.
"John Gabriel," "John Gabriel," "John Gabriel."  Every one knew
what a great man "John Gabriel" was!
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Warmly and emphatically.]  He was a great man then.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  Yes, to all appearance.  But he never breathed a single word to
me as to his real position--never gave a hint as to where he got
his means from.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  No, no; and other people did not dream of it either.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  I don't care about the other people.  But it was his duty to
tell me the truth.  And that he never did!  He kept on lying to
me--lying abominably----
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Interrupting.]  Surely not, Gunhild.  He kept things back
perhaps, but I am sure he did not lie.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  Well, well; call it what you please; it makes no difference.
And then it all fell to pieces--the whole thing.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [To herself.]  Yes, everything fell to pieces--for him--and
for others.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Drawing herself up menacingly.]  But I tell you this, Ella,
I do not give in yet!  I shall redeem myself yet--you may make
up your mind to that!
