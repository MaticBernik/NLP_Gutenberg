AN ELDERLY LADY [at the window].
When shall we go and order the trousseau?
MRS. STRAWMAN.
How are they selling cotton-bombasine?
A GENTLEMAN [to some ladies on the verandah].
Just look at Lind and Anna; what's his sport?
LADIES [with shrill ecstasy].
Gracious, he kissed her glove!
OTHERS [similarly, springing up].
                        No!  Kiss'd it!  Really?
LIND [appears, red and embarrassed, in the doorway].
O, stuff and nonsense!                  [Disappears.
MISS JAY.
                       Yes, I saw it clearly.
STIVER [in the door, with a coffee-cup in one hand and
      a biscuit in the other].
The witnesses must not mislead the court;
I here make affidavit, they're in error.
MISS JAY [within].
Come forward, Anna; stand before this mirror!
SOME LADIES [calling].
You, too, Lind!
MISS JAY.
                Back to back!  A little nearer!
LADIES.
Come, let us see by how much she is short.
    [All run into the garden-room; laughter and shrill
      talk are heard for a while from within.
    [FALK, who during the preceding scene has been
      walking about in the garden, advances into the
      foreground, stops and looks in until the noise
      has somewhat abated.
FALK.
There love's romance is being done to death.--
The butcher once who boggled at the slaughter,
Prolonging needlessly the ox's breath,--
He got his twenty days of bread and water;
But these--these butchers yonder--they go free.
                           [Clenches his fist.
I could be tempted--; hold, words have no worth,
I've sworn it, action only from henceforth!
LIND [coming hastily but cautiously out].
Thank God, they're talking fashions; now's my chance
To slip away--
FALK.
               Ha, Lind, you've drawn the prize
Of luck,--congratulations buzz and dance
All day about you, like a swarm of flies.
LIND.
They're all at heart so kindly and so nice;
But rather fewer clients would suffice.
Their helping hands begin to gall and fret me;
I'll get a moment's respite, if they'll let me.
                       [Going out to the right.
FALK.
Wither away?
LIND.
             Our den;--it has a lock;
In case you find the oak is sported, knock.
FALK.
But shall I not fetch Anna to you?
LIND.
                                       No--
If she wants anything, she'll let me know.
Last night we were discussing until late;
We've settled almost everything of weight;
Besides I think it scarcely goes with piety
To have too much of one's beloved's society.
FALK.
Yes, you are right; for daily food we need
A simple diet.
LIND.
               Pray, excuse me, friend.
I want a whiff of reason and the weed;
I haven't smoked for three whole days on end.
My blood was pulsing in such agitation,
I trembled for rejection all the time--
FALK.
Yes, you may well desire recuperation--
LIND.
And won't tobacco's flavour be sublime!
    [Goes out to the right.  MISS JAY and some other
      LADIES come out of the garden-room.
MISS JAY [to FALK].
That was he surely?
FALK.
                    Yes, your hunted deer.
LADIES.
To run away from us!
OTHERS.
                     For shame!  For shame!
FALK.
'Tis a bit shy at present, but, no fear,
A week of servitude will make him tame.
