FALK.
Ah yes!  And then--?
MISS JAY.
                    She broke with kin and class.
FALK.
She broke--?
MRS. HALM.
             Broke with them.
FALK.
                              There's a plucky lass!
MISS JAY.
And fled to Strawman's garret--
FALK.
                                How?  Without--
Ahem, the priestly consecration?
MISS JAY.
                                 Shame!
MRS. HALM.
Fy, fy! my late beloved husband's name
Was on the list of sponsors--!
STIVER [to MISS JAY].
                               The one room
Not housing sheep and cattle, I presume.
MISS JAY [to STIVER].
O, but you must consider this, my friend;
There is no _Want_ where Love's the guiding star;
All's right without if tender Troth's within.
                                         [To Falk.
He loved her to the notes of the guitar,
And she gave lessons on the violin--
MRS. HALM.
Then all, of course, on credit they bespoke--
GULDSTAD.
Till, in a year, the timber merchant broke.
MRS. HALM.
Then Strawman had a call to north.
MISS JAY.
                                   And there
Vowed, in a letter that I saw (as few did),
He lived but for his duty, and for her.
FALK [as if completing her statement].
And with those words his Life's Romance concluded.
MRS. HALM [rising].
How if we should go out upon the lawn,
And see if there's no prospect of them yet?
MISS JAY [drawing on her mantle].
It's cool already.
MRS. HALM.
                   Svanhild, will you get
My woollen shawl?--Come ladies, pray!
LIND [to ANNA, unobserved by the others].
                                      Go on!
    [SVANHILD goes into the house; the others, except
       FALK, go towards the back and out to the left.
       LIND, who has followed, stops and returns.
LIND.
My friend!
FALK.
          Ah, ditto.
LIND.
                    Falk, your hand!  The tide
Of joy's so vehement, it will perforce
Break out--
FALK.
            Hullo there; you must first be tried;
Sentence and hanging follow in due course.
Now, what on earth's the matter?  To conceal
From me, your friend, this treasure of your finding;
For you'll confess the inference is binding:
You've come into a prize off Fortune's wheel!
LIND.
I've snared and taken Fortune's blessed bird!
FALK.
How?  Living,--and undamaged by the steel?
LIND.
Patience; I'll tell the matter in one word.
I am engaged!  Conceive--!
FALK [quickly].
                           Engaged!
LIND.
                                    It's true!
To-day,--with unimagined courage swelling,
I said,--ahem, it will not bear re-telling;--
But only think,--the sweet young maiden grew
Quite rosy-red,--but not at all enraged!
You see, Falk, what I ventured for a bride!
She listened,--and I rather think she cried;
That, sure, means "Yes"?
FALK.
                         If precedents decide;
Go on.
LIND.
        And so we really are--engaged?
FALK.
I should conclude so; but the only way
To be quite certain, is to ask Miss Jay.
LIND.
O no, I feel so confident, so clear!
So perfectly assured, and void of fear.
                [Radiantly, in a mysterious tone.
Hark!  I had leave her fingers to caress
When from the coffee-board she drew the cover.
FALK [lifting and emptying his glass].
Well, flowers of spring your wedding garland dress!
LIND [doing the same].
And here I swear by heaven that I will love her
Until I die, with love as infinite
As now glows in me,--for she is so sweet!
