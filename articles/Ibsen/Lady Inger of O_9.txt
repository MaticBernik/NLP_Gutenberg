  LADY INGER.  And how did the others keep their promise?  I speak
not of you, Olaf Skaktavl, but of your friends, all our Norwegian
nobles?  Not one of them, in all these years, has had the courage
to be a man; and yet they lay it to my charge that I am a woman.
  OLAF SKAKTAVL.  I know what you would say.  Why have they bent
to the yoke, and not defied the tyrants to the last?  'Tis but
too true; there is base metal enough in our noble houses nowadays.
But had they held together--who knows what might have been?  And
you could have held them together, for before you all had bowed.
  LADY INGER.  My answer were easy enough, but it would scarce
content you.  So let us leave speaking of what cannot be changed.
Tell me rather what has brought you to Ostrat.  Do you need harbour?
Well, I will try to hide you.  If you would have aught else, speak
out; you shall find me ready----
  OLAF SKAKTAVL.  For twenty years have I been homeless.  In the
mountains of Jaemteland my hair has grown grey.  My dwelling has
been with wolves and bears.--You see, Lady Inger--_I_ need you
not; but both nobles and people stand in sore need of you.
  LADY INGER.  The old burden.
  OLAF SKAKTAVL.  Ay, it sounds but ill in your ears, I know; yet
hear it you must for all that.  In brief, then: I come from Sweden:
troubles are at hand: the Dales are ready to rise.
  LADY INGER.  I know it.
  OLAF SKAKTAVL.  Peter Kanzler is with us--secretly, you understand.
  LADY INGER (starting).  Peter Kanzler?
  OLAF SKAKTAVL.  It is he that has sent me to Ostrat.
  LADY INGER (rises).  Peter Kanzler, say you?
  OLAF SKAKTAVL.  He himself;--but mayhap you no longer know him?
  LADY INGER (half to herself).  Only too well!--But tell me, I
pray you,--what message do you bring?
  OLAF SKAKTAVL.  When the rumour of the rising reached the border
mountains, where I then was, I set off at once into Sweden.  'Twas
not hard to guess that Peter Kanzler had a finger in the game.  I
sought him out and offered to stand by him;--he knew me of old, as
you know, and knew that he could trust me; so he has sent me hither.
  LADY INGER (impatiently).  Yes yes,--he sent you hither to----?
  OLAF SKAKTAVL (with secrecy).  Lady Inger--a stranger comes to
Ostrat to-night.
  LADY INGER (surprised).  What?  Know you that----?
  OLAF SKAKTAVL.  Assuredly I know it.  I know all.  'Twas to meet
him that Peter Kanzler sent me hither.
  LADY INGER.  To meet him?  Impossible, Olaf Skaktavl,--impossible!
  OLAF SKAKTAVL.  'Tis as I tell you.  If he be not already come,
he will soon----
  LADY INGER.  Yes, I know; but----
  OLAF SKAKTAVL.  Then you know of his coming?
  LADY INGER.  Ay, surely.  He sent me a message.  That was why
they opened to you as soon as you knocked.
  OLAF SKAKTAVL (listens).  Hush!--some one is riding along the
road.  (Goes to the window.)  They are opening the gate.
