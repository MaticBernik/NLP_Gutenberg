BROVIK.
Oh you don't much care about doing it.
SOLNESS.
[Flaring up.] Don't care! Who dares to say that?
BROVIK.
You said so yourself just now.
SOLNESS.
Oh, never mind what I say.--Would they give Ragnar the building of that
villa?
BROVIK.
Yes. You see, he knows the family. And then--just for the fun of the
thing--he has made drawings and estimates and so forth--
SOLNESS.
Are they pleased with the drawings? The people who will have to live in
the house?
BROVIK.
Yes. If you would only look through them and approve of them--
SOLNESS.
Then they would let Ragnar build their home for them?
BROVIK.
They were immensely pleased with his idea. They thought it exceedingly
original, they said.
SOLNESS.
Oho! Original! Not the old-fashioned stuff that _I_ am in the habit of
turning out!
BROVIK.
It seemed to them different.
SOLNESS.
[With suppressed irritation.] So it was to see Ragnar that they came
here--whilst I was out!
BROVIK.
They came to call upon you--and at the same time to ask whether you
would mind retiring--
SOLNESS.
[Angrily.] Retire? I?
BROVIK.
In case you thought that Ragnar's drawings--
SOLNESS.
I! Retire in favour of your son!
BROVIK.
Retire from the agreement, they meant.
SOLNESS.
Oh, it comes to the same thing. [Laughs angrily.] So that is it, is it?
Halvard Solness is to see about retiring now! To make room for younger
men! For the very youngest, perhaps! He must make room! Room! Room!
BROVIK.
Why, good heavens! there is surely room for more than one single man--
SOLNESS.
Oh, there's not so very much room to spare either. But, be that as it
may--I will never retire! I will never give way to anybody! Never of my
own free will. Never in this world will I do that!
BROVIK.
[Rise with difficulty.] Then I am to pass out of life without any
certainty? Without a gleam of happiness? Without any faith or trust in
Ragnar? Without having seen a single piece of work of his doing? Is that
to be the way of it?
SOLNESS.
[Turns half aside, and mutters.] H'm--don't ask more just now.
BROVIK.
I must have an answer to this one question. Am I to pass out of life in
such utter poverty?
SOLNESS.
[Seems to struggle with himself; finally he says, in a low but firm
voice:] You must pass out of life as best you can.
BROVIK.
Then be it so. [He goes up the room.
SOLNESS.
[Following him, half is desperation.] Don't you understand that I cannot
help it? I am what I am, and I cannot change my nature!
BROVIK.
No; I suppose that you can't. [Reels and supports himself against the
sofa-table.] May I have a glass of water?
SOLNESS.
By all means. [Fills a glass and hands it to him.
BROVIK.
Thanks. [Drinks and puts the glass down again.
     [SOLNESS goes up and opens the door of the draughtsmen's office.
SOLNESS.
Ragnar--you must come and take your father home.
