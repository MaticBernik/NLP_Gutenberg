FALK.
                     No, I only brood,--
SVANHILD [with thoughtful sympathy].
You seem to be two natures, still at feud,--
Unreconciled--
FALK.
               I know it well.
SVANHILD [impetuously].
                               But why?
FALK [losing self-control].
Why, why?  Because I hate to go about
With soul bared boldly to the vulgar eye,
As Jock and Jennie hang their passions out;
To wear my glowing heart upon my sleeve,
Like women in low dresses.  You, alone,
Svanhild, you only,--you, I did believe,--
Well, it is past, that dream, for ever flown.--
    [She goes to the summer-house and looks out;
      he follows.
You listen--?
SVANHILD.
              To another voice, that sings.
Hark! every evening when the sun's at rest,
A little bird floats hither on beating wings,--
See there--it darted from its leafy nest--
And, do you know, it is my faith, as oft
As God makes any songless soul, He sends
A little bird to be her friend of friends,
And sing for ever in her garden-croft.
FALK [picking up a stone].
Then must the owner and the bird be near,
Or its song's squandered on a stranger's ear.
SVANHILD.
Yes, that is true; but I've discovered mine.
Of speech and song I am denied the power,
But when it warbles in its leafy bower,
Poems flow in upon my brain like wine--
Ah, yes,--they fleet--they are not to be won--
    [FALK throws the stone.  SVANHILD screams.
O God, you've hit it!  Ah, what have you done!
    [She hurries out to the the right and then
      quickly returns.
O pity! pity!
FALK [in passionate agitation].
              No,--but eye for eye,
Svanhild, and tooth for tooth.  Now you'll attend
No further greetings from your garden-friend,
No guerdon from the land of melody.
That is my vengeance: as you slew I slay.
SVANHILD.
I slew?
FALK.
        You slew.  Until this very day,
A clear-voiced song-bird warbled in my soul;
See,--now one passing bell for both may toll--
You've killed it!
SVANHILD.
                  Have I?
FALK.
                         Yes, for you have slain
My young, high-hearted, joyous exultation--
                                 [Contemptuously.
By your betrothal!
SVANHILD.
                   How!  But pray explain--!
FALK.
O, it's in full accord with expectation;
He gets his licence, enters orders, speeds to
A post,--as missionary in the West--
SVANHILD [in the same tone].
A pretty penny, also, he succeeds to;--
For it is Lind you speak of--?
FALK.
                               You know best
Of whom I speak.
SVANHILD [with a subdued smile].
                 As the bride's sister, true,
I cannot help--
FALK.
                Great God!  It is not you--?
SVANHILD.
Who win this overplus of bliss?  Ah no!
FALK [with almost childish joy].
It is not you!  O God be glorified!
What love, what mercy does He not bestow!
I shall not see you as another's bride;--
'Twas but the fire of pain He bade me bear--
                    [Tries to seize her hand.
O hear me, Svanhild, hear me then--
SVANHILD [pointing quickly to the background].
                                    See there!
    [She goes towards the house.  At the same moment
      MRS. HALM, ANNA, MISS JAY, GULDSTAD, STIVER, and
      LIND emerge from the background.  During the
      previous scene the sun has set; it is now dark.
