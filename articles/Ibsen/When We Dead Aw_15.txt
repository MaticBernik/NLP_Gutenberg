PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Seriously.] Yes, Maia--it was for another reason. A quite different
reason. And that is what we must sooner or later have a clear
explanation about.
MAIA.
[In a fit of suppressed laughter.] Heavens, how solemn you look!
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Suspiciously scrutinising her.] Yes, perhaps a little more solemn than
necessary.
MAIA.
How so--?
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
And that is a very good thing for us both.
MAIA.
You begin to make me feel curious, Rubek.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Only curious? Not a little bit uneasy.
MAIA.
[Shaking her head.] Not in the least.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Good. Then listen.--You said that day down at the Baths that it seemed
to you I had become very nervous of late--
MAIA.
Yes, and you really have.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
And what do you think can be the reason of that?
MAIA.
How can I tell--? [Quickly.] Perhaps you have grown weary of this
constant companionship with me.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Constant--? Why not say "everlasting"?
MAIA.
Daily companionship, then. Here have we two solitary people lived down
there for four or five mortal years, and scarcely have an hour away from
each other.--We two all by ourselves.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[With interest.] Well? And then--?
MAIA.
[A little oppressed.] You are not a particularly sociable man, Rubek.
You like to keep to yourself and think your own thoughts. And of course
I can't talk properly to you about your affairs. I know nothing about
art and that sort of thing-- [With an impatient gesture.] And care very
little either, for that matter!
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Well, well; and that's why we generally sit by the fireside, and chat
about your affairs.
MAIA.
Oh, good gracious--I have no affairs to chat about.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Well, they are trifles, perhaps; but at any rate the time passes for us
in that way as well as another, Maia.
MAIA.
Yes, you are right. Time passes. It is passing away from you,
Rubek.--And I suppose it is really that that makes you so uneasy--
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Nods vehemently.] And so restless! [Writhing in his seat.] No, I shall
soon not be able to endure this pitiful life any longer.
MAIA.
[Rises and stands for a moment looking at him.] If you want to get rid
of me, you have only to say so.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Why will you use such phrases? Get rid of you?
MAIA.
Yes, if you want to have done with me, please say so right out. And I
will go that instant.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[With an almost imperceptible smile.] Do you intend that as a threat,
Maia?
MAIA.
There can be no threat for you in what I said.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Rising.] No, I confess you are right there. [Adds after a pause.] You
and I cannot possibly go on living together like this--
MAIA.
Well? And then--?
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
There is no "then" about it. [With emphasis on his words.] Because we
two cannot go on living together alone--it does not necessarily follow
that we must part.
