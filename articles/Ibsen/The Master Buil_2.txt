BROVIK.
Do as I say, child. And shut the door after you.
     [KAIA goes reluctantly into the draughtsmen's office, glances
       anxiously and imploringly at SOLNESS, and shuts the door.
BROVIK.
[Lowering his voice a little.] I don't want the poor children to know
how I am.
SOLNESS.
Yes, you have been looking very poorly of late.
BROVIK.
It will soon be all over with me. My strength is ebbing--from day to
day.
SOLNESS.
Won't you sit down?
BROVIK.
Thanks--may I?
SOLNESS.
[Placing the arm-chair more conveniently.] Here--take this chair.--And
now?
BROVIK.
[Has seated himself with difficulty.] Well, you see, it's about Ragnar.
That is what weighs most upon me. What is to become of him?
SOLNESS.
Of course your son will stay with me as long as ever he likes.
BROVIK.
But that is just what he does not like. He feels that he cannot stay
here any longer.
SOLNESS.
Why, I should say he was very well off here. But if he wants more money,
I should not mind--
BROVIK.
No, no! It is not that. [Impatiently.] But sooner or later he, too, must
have a chance of doing something on his own account.
SOLNESS.
[Without looking at him.] Do you think that Ragnar has quite talent
enough to stand alone?
BROVIK.
No, that is just the heartbreaking part of it--I have begun to have
my doubts about the boy. For you have never said so much as--as one
encouraging word about him. And yet I cannot but think there must be
something in him--he can't be without talent.
SOLNESS.
Well, but he has learnt nothing--nothing thoroughly, I mean. Except, of
course, to draw.
BROVIK.
[Looks at him with covert hatred, and says hoarsely.] You had learned
little enough of the business when you were in my employment. But
that did not prevent you from setting to work--[breathing with
difficulty]--and pushing your way up, and taking the wind out of my
sails--mine, and so may other people's.
SOLNESS.
Yes, you see--circumstances favoured me.
BROVIK.
You are right there. Everything favoured you. But then how can you have
the heart to let me go to my grave--without having seen what Ragnar is
fit for? And of course I am anxious to see them married, too--before I
go.
SOLNESS.
[Sharply.] Is it she who wishes it?
BROVIK.
Not Kaia so much as Ragnar--he talks about it every day. [Appealingly.]
You must help him to get some independent work now! I must see something
that the lad has done. Do you hear?
SOLNESS.
[Peevishly.] Hang it, man, you can't expect me to drag commissions down
from the moon for him!
BROVIK.
He has the chance of a capital commission at this very moment. A big bit
of work.
SOLNESS.
[Uneasily, startled.] Has he?
BROVIK.
I you would give your consent.
SOLNESS.
What sort of work do you mean?
BROVIK.
[With some hesitation.] He can have the building of that villa out at
Lovstrand.
SOLNESS.
That! Why I am going to build that myself.
