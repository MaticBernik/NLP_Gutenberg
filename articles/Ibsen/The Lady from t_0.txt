Arnholm. Thanks, thanks, Doctor Wangel. A thousand thanks. (They shake
hands and walk up the garden together.) And there are the children!
(Holds out his hands and looks at them.) I should hardly have known
these two again.
Wangel. No, I believe you.
Arnholm. And yet--perhaps Bolette--yes, I should have known Bolette
again.
Wangel. Hardly, I think. Why, it is eight--nine years since you saw her.
Ah, yes! Many a thing has changed here meanwhile.
Arnholm (looking round). I really don't see it; except that the trees
have grown remarkably, and that you've set up that arbour.
Wangel. Oh! no--outwardly.
Arnholm (smiling). And then, of course, you've two grown-up daughters
here now.
Wangel. Grown up! Well, there's only one grown up.
Hilde (aside). Just listen to father!
Wangel. But now let's sit down up there on the verandah. It's cooler
than here. Won't you?
Arnholm. Thanks, thanks, dear doctor.
(They go up. WANGEL motions him to the rocking-chair.)
Wangel. That's right! Now make yourself comfortable, and rest, for you
seem rather tired after your journey.
Arnholm. Oh, that's nothing. Here, amid these surroundings Bolette (to
WANGEL). Hadn't we better have some soda and syrup in the sitting-room?
It's sure to be too hot out here soon.
Wangel. Yes, girls. Let's have some soda and syrup, and perhaps a drop
of Cognac, too.
Bolette. Cognac, too!
Wangel. Just a little, in case anyone should like some.
Bolette. All right. Hilde, go down to the office with the bag.
(BOLETTE goes into the room, and closes the door after her.
HILDE takes the bag, and goes through the garden to the back of the
house.)
Arnholm (who has followed BOLETTE with his eyes). What a splendid--.
They are both splendid girls, who've grown up here for you.
Wangel (sitting down). Yes; you think so, too?
Arnholm. Why, it's simply amazing, how Bolette!--and Hilde, too! But
now, you yourself, dear doctor. Do you think of staying here all your
life?
Wangel. Yes; I suppose so. Why, I've been born and bred here, so to say.
I lived here so very happily with--her who left us so early--she whom
you knew when you were here before, Arnholm.
Arnholm. Yes, yes!
Wangel. And now I live here so happily with her who has taken her place.
Ah! On the whole, fate has been very good to me.
Arnholm. You have no children by your second marriage? Wangel. We had a
little boy, two--two and a half years ago. But he didn't stay long. He
died when he was four--five months old.
Arnholm. Isn't your wife at home today?
Wangel. Oh, yes. She's sure to be here soon. She's down there bathing.
She does so every blessed day no matter what the weather.
Arnholm. Is she ill, then?
Wangel. Not exactly ill, although she has been extremely nervous for the
last few years--that is to say, she is now and then. I can't make out
what really ails her. But to plunge into the sea is her joy and delight.
