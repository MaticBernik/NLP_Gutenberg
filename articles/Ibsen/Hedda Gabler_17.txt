HEDDA.
This is what comes of sneaking in by the back way.(7) [She fires.
BRACK.
[Nearer.] Are you out of your senses--!
HEDDA.
Dear me--did I happen to hit you?
BRACK.
[Still outside.] I wish you would let these pranks alone!
HEDDA.
Come in then, Judge.
  JUDGE BRACK, dressed as though for a men's party, enters by
  the glass door.  He carries a light overcoat over his arm.
BRACK.
What the deuce--haven't you tired of that sport, yet? What are you
shooting at?
HEDDA.
Oh, I am only firing in the air.
BRACK.
[Gently takes the pistol out of her hand.] Allow me, madam! [Looks at
it.] Ah--I know this pistol well! [Looks around.] Where is the case? Ah,
here it is. [Lays the pistol in it, and shuts it.] Now we won't play at
that game any more to-day.
HEDDA.
Then what in heaven's name would you have me do with myself?
BRACK.
Have you had no visitors?
HEDDA.
[Closing the glass door.] Not one. I suppose all our set are still out
of town.
BRACK.
And is Tesman not at home either?
HEDDA.
[At the writing-table, putting the pistol-case in a drawer which she
shuts.] No. He rushed off to his aunt's directly after lunch; he didn't
expect you so early.
BRACK.
H'm--how stupid of me not to have thought of that!
HEDDA.
[Turning her head to look at him.] Why stupid?
BRACK.
Because if I had thought of it I should have come a little--earlier.
HEDDA.
[Crossing the room.] Then you would have found no one to receive you;
for I have been in my room changing my dress ever since lunch.
BRACK.
And is there no sort of little chink that we could hold a parley
through?
HEDDA.
You have forgotten to arrange one.
BRACK.
That was another piece of stupidity.
HEDDA.
Well, we must just settle down here--and wait. Tesman is not likely to
be back for some time yet.
BRACK.
Never mind; I shall not be impatient.
  HEDDA seats herself in the corner of the sofa.  BRACK lays his
  overcoat over the back of the nearest chair, and sits down, but
  keeps his hat in his hand.  A short silence.  They look at each
  other.
HEDDA.
Well?
BRACK.
[In the same tone.] Well?
HEDDA.
I spoke first.
BRACK.
[Bending a little forward.] Come, let us have a cosy little chat, Mrs.
Hedda.(8)
HEDDA.
[Leaning further back in the sofa.] Does it not seem like a whole
eternity since our last talk? Of course I don't count those few words
yesterday evening and this morning.
BRACK.
You mean since out last confidential talk? Our last _tete-a-tete_?
HEDDA.
Well yes--since you put it so.
BRACK.
Not a day passed but I have wished that you were home again.
HEDDA.
And I have done nothing but wish the same thing.
BRACK.
You? Really, Mrs. Hedda? And I thought you had been enjoying your tour
so much!
HEDDA.
Oh yes, you may be sure of that!
BRACK.
But Tesman's letters spoke of nothing but happiness.
