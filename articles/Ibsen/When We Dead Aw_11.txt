IRENE.
[Laying her hands flat upon the table and leaning against the back of
her chair.] And then you were done with me--
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Reproachfully.] Irene!
IRENE.
You had no longer any use for me--
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
How can you say that!
IRENE. --and began to look about you for other ideals--
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
I found none, none after you.
IRENE.
And no other models, Arnold?
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
You were no model to me. You were the fountainhead of my achievement.
IRENE.
[Is silent for a short time.] What poems have you made since? In marble
I mean. Since the day I left you.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
I have made no poems since that day--only frittered away my life in
modelling.
IRENE.
And that woman, whom you are now living with--?
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Interrupting vehemently.] Do not speak of her now! It makes me tingle
with shame.
IRENE.
Where are you thinking of going with her?
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Slack and weary.] Oh, on a tedious coasting-voyage to the North, I
suppose.
IRENE.
[Looks at him, smiles almost imperceptibly, and whispers.] You should
rather go high up into the mountains. As high as ever you can. Higher,
higher,--always higher, Arnold.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[With eager expectation.] Are you going up there?
IRENE.
Have you the courage to meet me once again?
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Struggling with himself, uncertainly.] If we could--oh, if only we
could--!
IRENE.
Why can we not do what we will? [Looks at him and whispers beseechingly
with folded hands.] Come, come, Arnold! Oh, come up to me--!
    [MAIA enters, glowing with pleasure, from behind the hotel,
       and goes quickly up to the table where they were previously
       sitting.]
MAIA.
[Still at the corner of the hotel, without looking around.] Oh, you
may say what you please, Rubek, but--[Stops, as she catches sight of
IRENE]--Oh, I beg your pardon--I see you have made an acquaintance.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Curtly.] Renewed an acquaintance. [Rises.] What was it you wanted with
me?
MAIA.
I only wanted to say this: you may do whatever you please, but _I_ am
not going with you on that disgusting steamboat.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Why not?
MAIA.
Because I want to go up on the mountains and into the forests--that's
what I want. [Coaxingly.] Oh, you must let me do it, Rubek.--I shall be
so good, so good afterwards!
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Who is it that has put these ideas into your head?
MAIA.
Why he--that horrid bear-killer. Oh you cannot conceive all the
marvelous things he has to tell about the mountains. And about life up
there! They're ugly, horrid, repulsive, most of the yarns he spins--for
I almost believe he's lying--but wonderfully alluring all the same. Oh,
won't you let me go with him? Only to see if what he says is true, you
understand. May I, Rubek?
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Yes, I have not the slightest objection. Off you go to the mountains--as
far and as long as you please. I shall perhaps be going the same way
myself.
