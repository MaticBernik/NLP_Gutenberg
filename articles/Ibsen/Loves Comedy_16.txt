GULDSTAD.
                       Yes, with your goodwill.
But let me first put on my overcoat.
We prose-folks are susceptible to chill;
The night wind takes us by the tuneless throat.
Good evening!
FALK.
              Sir, a word ere you proceed!
Show me a task, a mighty one, you know--!
I'm going in for life--!
GULDSTAD [with ironical emphasis].
                         Well, in you go!
You'll find that you are in for it, indeed.
FALK [looking reflectively at him, says slowly].
There is my program, furnished in a phrase.
                          [In a lively outburst.
Now I have wakened from my dreaming days,
I've cast the die of life's supreme transaction,
I'll show you--else the devil take me--
GULDSTAD.
                                        Fie,
No cursing: curses never scared a fly.
FALK.
Words, words, no more, but action, only action!
I will reverse the plan of the Creation;--
Six days were lavish'd in that occupation;
My world's still lying void and desolate,
Hurrah, to-morrow, Sunday--I'll create!
GULDSTAD [laughing].
Yes, strip, and tackle it like a man, that's right!
But first go in and sleep on it.  Good-night!
    [Goes out to the left.  SVANHILD appears in the
      room over the verandah; she shuts the window
      and draws down the blind.
FALK.
No, first I'll act.  I've slept too long and late.
    [Looks up at SVANHILD's window, and exclaims, as
      if seized with a sudden resolution:
Good-night!  Good-night!  Sweet dreams to-night be thine;
To-morrow, Svanhild, thou art plighted mine!
    [Goes out quickly to the right; from the water the
      CHORUS is heard again.
CHORUS.
Maybe I shall shatter my roaming bark,
But it's passing sweet to be roaming!
    [The boat slowly glides away as the curtain falls.
ACT SECOND
Sunday afternoon.  Well-dressed ladies and gentlemen are drinking
    coffee on the verandah.  Several of the guests appear through
    the open glass door in the garden-room; the following song is
    heard from within.
CHORUS.
Welcome, welcome, new plighted pair
To the merry ranks of the plighted!
Now you may revel as free as air,
Caress without stint and kiss without care,--
No longer of footfall affrighted.
Now you are licensed, wherever you go,
To rapture of cooing and billing;
Now you have leisure love's seed to sow,
Water, and tend it, and make it grow;--
Let us see you've a talent for tilling!
MISS JAY [within].
Ah Lind, if I only had chanced to hear,
I would have teased you!
A LADY [within].
                         How vexatious though!
ANOTHER LADY [in the doorway].
Dear Anna, did he ask in writing?
AN AUNT.
                                  No!
Mine did.
A LADY [on the verandah].
          How long has it been secret, dear?
                         [Runs into the room.
MISS JAY.
To-morrow there will be the ring to choose.
LADIES [eagerly].
We'll take his measure!
MISS JAY.
                        Nay; that she must do.
MRS. STRAWMAN [on the verandah, to a lady who is busy
             with embroidery].
What kind of knitting-needles do you use?
A SERVANT [in the door with a coffee-pot].
More coffee, madam?
A LADY.
                    Thanks, a drop or two.
MISS JAY [to ANNA].
How fortunate you've got your new manteau
Next week to go your round of visits in!
