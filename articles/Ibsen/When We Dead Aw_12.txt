MAIA.
[Quickly.] No, no, no, you needn't do that! Not on my account!
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
I want to go to the mountains. I have made up my mind to go.
MAIA.
Oh thanks, thanks! May I tell the bear-killer at once?
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Tell the bear-killer whatever you please.
MAIA.
Oh thanks, thanks, thanks! [Is about to take his hand; he repels the
movement.] Oh, how dear and good you are to-day, Rubek!
    [She runs into the hotel.
    [At the same time the door of the pavilion is softly and
       noiselessly set ajar.  The SISTER OF MERCY stands in the
       opening, intently on the watch.  No one sees her.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Decidedly, turning to IRENE.] Shall we meet up there then?
IRENE.
[Rising slowly.] Yes, we shall certainly meet.--I have sought for you so
long.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
When did you begin to seek for me, Irene?
IRENE.
[With a touch of jesting bitterness.] From the moment I realised that I
had given away to you something rather indispensable, Arnold. Something
one ought never to part with.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Bowing his head.] Yes, that is bitterly true. You gave me three or four
years of your youth.
IRENE.
More, more than that I gave you--spend-thrift as I then was.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Yes, you were prodigal, Irene. You gave me all your naked loveliness--
IRENE. --to gaze upon--
PROFESSOR RUBEK. --and to glorify--
IRENE.
Yes, for your own glorification.--And the child's.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
And yours too, Irene.
IRENE.
But you have forgotten the most precious gift.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
The most precious--? What gift was that?
IRENE.
I gave you my young, living soul. And that gift left me empty
within--soulless. [Looking at him with a fixed stare.] It was that I
died of, Arnold.
    [The SISTER OF MERCY opens the door wide and makes room for her.
       She goes into the pavilion.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Stands and looks after her; then whispers.] Irene!
ACT SECOND.
[Near a mountain resort. The landscape stretches, in the form of
   an immense treeless upland, towards a long mountain lake.  Beyond
   the lake rises a range of peaks with blue-white snow in the clefts.
   In the foreground on the left a purling brook falls in severed
   streamlets down a steep wall of rock, and thence flows smoothly
   over the upland until it disappears to the right.  Dwarf trees,
   plants, and stones along the course of the brook.  In the
   foreground on the right a hillock, with a stone bench on the
   top of it.  It is a summer afternoon, towards sunset.
[At some distance over the upland, on the other side of the brook,
   a troop of children is singing, dancing, and playing.  Some are
   dressed in peasant costume, others in town-made clothes.  Their
   happy laughter is heard, softened by distance, during the
   following.
[PROFESSOR RUBEK is sitting on the bench, with a plaid over his
   shoulders, and looking down at the children's play.
[Presently, MAIA comes forward from among some bushes on the upland
   to the left, well back, and scans the prospect with her hand
   shading her eyes.  She wears a flat tourist cap, a short skirt,
   kilted up, reaching only midway between ankle and knee, and high,
   stout lace-boots.  She has in her hand a long alpenstock.
