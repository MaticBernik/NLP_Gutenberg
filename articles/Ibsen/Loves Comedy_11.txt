FALK.
A grievous fault.
GULDSTAD.
                  But if her mother chooses
To spend a winter on her, she'll come out of it
Queen of them all, I'll wager.
FALK.
                               Not a doubt of it.
GULDSTAD [laughing].
Young women are odd creatures, to be sure!
FALK [gaily].
Like winter rye-seed, canopied secure
By frost and snow, invisibly they sprout.
GULDSTAD.
Then in the festive ball-room bedded out--
FALK.
With equivique and scandal for manure--
GULDSTAD.
And when April sun shines--
FALK.
                            There the blade is;
The seed shot up in mannikin green ladies!
    [LIND comes up and seizes FALK's hand.
LIND.
How well I chose,--past understanding well;--
I feel a bliss that nothing can dispel.
GULDSTAD.
There stands your mistress; tell us, if you can,
The right demeanor for a plighted man.
LIND [perturbed].
That's a third person's business to declare.
GULDSTAD [joking].
Ill-tempered!  This to Anna's ears I'll bear.
                            [Goes to the ladies.
LIND [looking after him].
Can such a man be tolerated?
FALK.
                             You
Mistook his aim, however,--
LIND.
                             And how so?
FALK.
It was not Anna that he had in view.
LIND.
How, was it Svanhild?
FALK.
                      Well, I hardly know.
                              [Whimsically.
Forgive me, martyr to another's cause!
LIND.
What do you mean?
FALK.
                  You've read the news to-night?
LIND.
No.
FALK.
    Do so.  There 'tis told in black and white
Of one who, ill-luck's bitter counsel taking,
Had his sound teeth extracted from his jaws
Because his cousin-german's teeth were aching.
MISS JAY [looking out to the left].
Here comes the priest!
MRS. HALM.
                       Now see a man of might!
STIVER.
Five children, six, seven, eight--
FALK.
                        And, heavens, all recent!
MISS JAY.
Ugh! it is almost to be called indecent.
    [A carriage has meantime been heard stopping outside
      to the left.  STRAWMAN, his wife, and eight little
      girls, all in traveling dress, enter one by one.
MRS. HALM. [advancing to meet them].
Welcome, a hearty welcome!
STRAWMAN.
                           Thank you.
MRS. STRAWMAN.
                                      It is
A party?
MRS. HALM.
         No, dear madam, not at all.
MRS. STRAWMAN.
If we disturb you--
MRS. HALM.
                     _Au contraire_, your visit
Could in no wise more opportunely fall.
My Anna's just engaged.
STRAWMAN [shaking ANNA's hand with unction].
                        Ah then, I must
Bear witness;--Lo! in wedded Love's presented
A treasure such as neither moth nor rust
Corrupt--if it be duly supplemented.
MRS. HALM.
But how delightful that your little maids
Should follow you to town.
STRAWMAN.
                           Four tender blades
We have besides.
MRS. HALM.
                 Ah, really?
STRAWMAN.
                             Three of whom
Are still too infantine to take to heart
A loving father's absence, when I come
To town for sessions.
MISS JAY [to MRS. HALM, bidding farewell].
                      Now I must depart.
MRS. HALM.
O, it is still so early!
MISS JAY.
                         I must fly
To town and spread the news.  The Storms, I know,
Go late to rest, they will be up; and oh!
How glad the aunts will be!  Now, dear, put by
Your shyness; for to-morrow a spring-tide
Of callers will flow in from every side!
