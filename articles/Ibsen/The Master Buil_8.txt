DR. HERDAL.
Well?
SOLNESS.
Well then, next day, pretty late in the evening, when old Brovik and
Ragnar had gone home, she came here again, and behaved as if I had made
an arrangement with her.
DR. HERDAL.
An arrangement? What about?
SOLNESS.
About the very thing my mind had been fixed on. But I hadn't said one
single word about it.
DR. HERDAL.
That was most extraordinary.
SOLNESS.
Yes, was it not? And now she wanted to know what she was to do
here--whether she could begin the very next morning, and so forth.
DR. HERDAL.
Don't you think she did it in order to be with her sweetheart?
SOLNESS.
That was what occurred to me at first. But no, that was not it. She
seemed to drift quite away from him--when once she had come here to me.
DR. HERDAL.
She drifted over to you, then?
SOLNESS.
Yes, entirely. If I happen to look at her when her back is turned, I can
tell that she feels it. She quivers and trembles the moment I come near
her. What do you think of that?
DR. HERDAL.
H'm--that's not very hard to explain.
SOLNESS.
Well, but what about the other thing? That she believed I had said to
her what I had only wished and willed--silently--inwardly--to myself?
What do you say to that? Can you explain that, Dr. Herdal?
DR. HERDAL.
No, I won't undertake to do that.
SOLNESS.
I felt sure you would not; and so I have never cared to talk about
it till now.--But it's a cursed nuisance to me in the long run, you
understand. Here have I got to go on day after day, pretending--. And
it's a shame to treat her so, too, poor girl. [Vehemently.] But I cannot
do anything else. For if she runs away from me--then Ragnar will be off
too.
DR. HERDAL.
And you have not told your wife the rights of the story?
SOLNESS.
No.
DR. HERDAL.
The why on earth don't you?
SOLNESS.
[Looks fixedly at him, and says in a low voice:] Because I seem to
find a sort of--of salutary self-torture in allowing Aline to do me an
injustice.
DR. HERDAL.
[Shakes his head.] I don't in the least understand what you mean.
SOLNESS.
Well, you see--it is like paying off a little bit of a huge,
immeasurable debt--
DR. HERDAL.
To your wife?
SOLNESS.
Yes; and that always helps to relieve one's mind a little. One can
breathe more freely for a while, you understand.
DR. HERDAL.
No, goodness knows, I don't understand at all--
SOLNESS.
[Breaking off, rises again.] Well, well, well--then we won't talk any
more about it. [He saunters across the room, returns, and stops beside
the table. Looks at the doctor with a sly smile.] I suppose you think
you have drawn me out nicely now, doctor?
DR. HERDAL.
[With some irritation.] Drawn you out? Again I have not the faintest
notion of what you mean, Mr. Solness.
SOLNESS.
Oh come, out with it; I have seen it quite clearly, you know.
