  KAIA FOSLI enters quietly by the door on the left.
SOLNESS.
[Turns his head, and says in an off-hand tone of indifference:] Well, is
that you?
KAIA.
I merely wished to let you know that I have come.
SOLNESS.
Yes, yes, that's all right. Hasn't Ragnar come too?
KAIA.
No, not yet. He had to wait a little while to see the doctor. But he is
coming presently to hear--
SOLNESS.
How is the old man to-day?
KAIA.
Not well. He begs you to excuse him; he is obliged to keep his bed
to-day.
SOLNESS.
Why, of course; by all means let him rest. But now, get to your work.
KAIA.
Yes. [Pauses at the door.] Do you wish to speak to Ragnar when he comes?
SOLNESS.
No--I don't know that I have anything particular to say to him.
     [KAIA goes out again to the left.  SOLNESS remains seated,
       turning over the drawings.
MRS. SOLNESS.
[Over beside the plants.] I wonder if he isn't going to die now, as
well?
SOLNESS.
[Looks up at her.] As well as who?
MRS. SOLNESS.
[Without answering.] Yes, yes--depend upon it, Halvard, old Brovik is
going to die too. You'll see that he will.
SOLNESS.
My dear Aline, ought you not to go out for a little walk?
MRS. SOLNESS.
Yes, I suppose I ought to.
     [She continues to attend the flowers.
SOLNESS.
[Bending over the drawings.] Is she still asleep?
MRS. SOLNESS.
[Looking at him.] Is it Miss Wangel you are sitting there thinking
about?
SOLNESS.
[Indifferently.] I just happened to recollect her.
MRS. SOLNESS.
Miss Wangle was up long ago.
SOLNESS.
Oh, was she?
MRS. SOLNESS.
When I went in to see her, she was busy putting her things in order.
     [She goes in front of the mirror and slowly begins to put on
       her hat.
SOLNESS.
[After a short pause.] So we have found a use for one our nurseries
after all, Aline.
MRS. SOLNESS.
Yes, we have.
SOLNESS.
That seems to me better than to have them all standing empty.
MRS. SOLNESS.
That emptiness is dreadful; you are right there.
SOLNESS.
[Closes the portfolio, rises and approaches her.] You will find that
we shall get on far better after this, Aline. Things will be more
comfortable. Life will be easier--especially for you.
MRS. SOLNESS.
[Looks at him.] After this?
SOLNESS.
Yes, believe me, Aline--
MRS. SOLNESS.
Do you mean--because she has come here?
SOLNESS.
[Checking himself.] I mean, of course--when once we have moved into the
new home.
MRS. SOLNESS.
[Takes her cloak.] Ah, do you think so, Halvard? Will it be better then?
SOLNESS.
I can't think otherwise. And surely you think so too?
MRS. SOLNESS.
I think nothing at all about the new house.
SOLNESS.
[Cast down.] It's hard for me to hear you say that; for you know it is
mainly for your sake that I have built it.
     [He offers to help her on with her cloak.
MRS. SOLNESS.
[Evades him.] The fact is, you do far too much for my sake.
