(RANK, HELMER, _and_ MRS. LINDE _go downstairs. The_ NURSE _comes
forward with the children;_ NORA _shuts the hall door._)
_Nora_. How fresh and well you look! Such red cheeks!--like apples and
roses. (_The children all talk at once while she speaks to them._) Have
you had great fun? That's splendid! What, you pulled both Emmy and Bob
along on the sledge?--both at once?--that _was_ good. You are a clever
boy, Ivar. Let me take her for a little, Anne. My sweet little baby
doll! (_Takes the baby from the_ MAID _and dances it up and down._) Yes,
yes, mother will dance with Bob too. What! Have you been snow-balling? I
wish I had been there too! No, no, I will take their things off, Anne;
please let me do it, it is such fun. Go in now, you look half frozen.
There is some hot coffee for you on the stove.
(_The_ NURSE _goes into the room on the left. Nora takes off the
children's things and throws them about, while they all talk to her at
once_.)
_Nora._ Really! Did a big dog run after you? But it didn't bite you? No,
dogs don't bite nice little dolly children. You mustn't look at the
parcels, Ivar. What are they? Ah, I daresay you would like to know. No,
no--it's something nasty! Come, let us have a game. What shall we play
at? Hide and Seek? Yes, we'll play Hide and Seek. Bob shall hide first.
Must I hide? Very well, I'll hide first. (_She and the children laugh
and shout, and romp in and out of the room; at last Nora hides under the
table the children rush in and look for her, but do not see her; they
hear her smothered laughter run to the table, lift up the cloth and find
her. Shouts of laughter. She crawls forward and pretends to frighten
them. Fresh laughter. Meanwhile there has been a knock at the hall door,
but none of them has noticed it. The door is half opened, and KROGSTAD
appears. He waits a little; the game goes on._)
_Krogstad_. Excuse me, Mrs. Helmer.
_Nora_ (_with a stifled cry, turns round and gets up on to her knees_).
Ah! what do you want?
_Krogstad_. Excuse me, the outer door was ajar; I suppose someone forgot
to shut it.
_Nora_ (_rising_). My husband is out, Mr. Krogstad.
_Krogstad_. I know that.
_Nora_. What do you want here, then?
_Krogstad_. A word with you.
_Nora_. With me?--(_To the children, gently_.) Go in to nurse. What? No,
the strange man won't do mother any harm. When he has gone we will have
another game. (_She takes the children into the room on the left, and
shuts the door after them._) You want to speak to me?
_Krogstad_. Yes, I do.
_Nora_. Today? It is not the first of the month yet.
_Krogstad_. No, it is Christmas Eve, and it will depend on yourself what
sort of a Christmas you will spend.
