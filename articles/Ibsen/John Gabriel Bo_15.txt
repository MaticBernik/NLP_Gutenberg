BORKMAN.
  [Jumping up in anger.]  Is this meant for me?  A reproach----!
FOLDAL.
  [Alarmed.]  No, no, for Heaven's sake, John Gabriel----!
BORKMAN.
  Yes, you are thinking of the disaster to the bank, I can see
you are.
FOLDAL.
  [Soothingly.]  But I don't blame you for that!  Heaven forbid!
BORKMAN.
  [Growling, resumes his seat.]  Well, that is a good thing, at
any rate.
FOLDAL.
  Besides, you mustn't think it is my wife that I complain of.  It
is true she has not much polish, poor thing; but she is a good sort
of woman all the same.  No, it's the children.
BORKMAN.
  I thought as much.
FOLDAL.
  For the children--well, they have more culture and therefore
they expect more of life.
BORKMAN.
  [Looking at him sympathetically.]  And so your children despise
you, Vilhelm?
FOLDAL.
  [Shrugging his shoulders.]  I haven't made much of a career,
you see--there is no denying that.
BORKMAN.
  [Moving nearer to him, and laying his hand upon his arm.]  Do
they not know, then, that in your young days you wrote a tragedy?
FOLDAL.
  Yes, of course they know that.  But it doesn't seem to make much
impression on them.
BORKMAN.
  Then they don't understand these things.  For your tragedy is
good.  I am firmly convinced of that.
FOLDAL.
  [Brightening up.]  Yes, don't you think there are some good
things in it, John Gabriel?  Good God, if I could only manage
to get it placed----!  [Opens his portfolio, and begins eagerly
turning over the contents.]  Look here!  Just let me show you
one or two alterations I have made.
BORKMAN.
  Have you it with you?
FOLDAL.
  Yes, I thought I would bring it.  It's so long now since I have
read it to you.  And I thought perhaps it might amuse you to hear
an act or two.
BORKMAN.
  [Rising, with a negative gesture.]  No, no, we will keep that
for another time.
FOLDAL.
  Well, well, as you please.
    [BORKMAN paces up and down the room.  FOLDAL puts the
        manuscript up again.
BORKMAN.
  [Stopping in front of him.]  You are quite right in what you
said just now--you have not made any career.  But I promise you
this, Vilhelm, that when once the hour of my restoration strikes----
FOLDAL.
  [Making a movement to rise.]  Oh, thanks, thanks!
BORKMAN.
  [Waving his hand.]  No, please be seated.  [With rising
excitement.]  When the hour of my restoration strikes--when they
see that they cannot get on without me--when they come to me, here
in the gallery, and crawl to my feet, and beseech me to take the
reins of the bank again----!  The new bank, that they have founded
and can't carry on----  [Placing himself beside the writing-table
in the same attitude as before, and striking his breast.]  Here
I shall stand, and receive them!  And it shall be known far and
wide, all the country over, what conditions John Gabriel Borkman
imposes before he will----  [Stopping suddenly and staring at
FOLDAL.]  You're looking so doubtfully at me!  Perhaps you do not
believe that they will come?  That they must, must, must come to
me some day?  Do you not believe it?
