MAIA.
What do you mean by that?
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Putting the question aside.] Nothing. Nothing that you would
understand.
    [IRENE advances from the right over the upland.  The children
       at their play have already caught sight of her and run to
       meet her.  She is now surrounded by them; some appear confident
       and at ease, others uneasy and timid.  She talks low to them
       and indicates that they are to go down to the hotel; she
       herself will rest a  little beside the brook.  The children
       run down over the slope to the left, half way to the back.
       IRENE goes up to the wall of rock, and lets the rillets of
       the cascade flow over her hands, cooling them.
MAIA.
[In a low voice.] Go down and speak to her alone, Rubek.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
And where will you go in the meantime?
MAIA.
[Looking significantly at him.] Henceforth I shall go my own ways.
    [She descends form the hillock and leaps over the brook, by aid
       of her alpenstock.  She stops beside IRENE.
MAIA.
Professor Rubek is up there, waiting for you, madam.
IRENE.
What does he want?
MAIA.
He wants you to help him to open a casket that has snapped to.
IRENE.
Can I help him in that?
MAIA.
He says you are the only person that can.
IRENE.
Then I must try.
MAIA.
Yes, you really must, madam.
    [She goes down by the path to the hotel.
    [In a little while PROFESSOR RUBEK comes down to IRENE, but stops
       with the brook between them.
IRENE.
[After a short pause.] She--the other one--said that you had been
waiting for me.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
I have waited for you year after year--without myself knowing it.
IRENE.
I could not come to you, Arnold. I was lying down there, sleeping the
long, deep, dreamful sleep.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
But now you have awakened, Irene!
IRENE.
[Shakes her head.] I have the heavy, deep sleep still in my eyes.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
You shall see that day will dawn and lighten for us both.
IRENE.
Do not believe that.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Urgently.] I do believe it! And I know it! Now that I have found you
again--
IRENE.
Risen from the grave.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Transfigured!
IRENE.
Only risen, Arnold. Not transfigured.
    [He crosses over to her by means of stepping-stones below the
       cascade.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Where have you been all day, Irene?
IRENE.
[Pointing.] Far, far over there, on the great dead waste--
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Turning the conversation.] You have not your--your friend with you
to-day, I see.
IRENE.
[Smiling.] My friend is keeping a close watch on me, none the less.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Can she?
IRENE.
[Glancing furtively around.] You may be sure she can--wherever I may
go. She never loses sight of me-- [Whispering.] Until, one fine sunny
morning, I shall kill her.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Would you do that?
IRENE.
With the utmost delight--if only I could manage it.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Why do you want to?
IRENE.
Because she deals in witchcraft. [Mysteriously.] Only think, Arnold--she
has changed herself into my shadow.
