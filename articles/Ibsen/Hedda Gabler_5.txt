MISS TESMAN.
[Going to meet HEDDA.] Good morning, my dear Hedda! Good morning, and a
hearty welcome!
HEDDA.
[Holds out her hand.] Good morning, dear Miss Tesman! So early a call!
That is kind of you.
MISS TESMAN.
[With some embarrassment.] Well--has the bride slept well in her new
home?
HEDDA.
Oh yes, thanks. Passably.
TESMAN.
[Laughing.] Passably! Come, that's good, Hedda! You were sleeping like a
stone when I got up.
HEDDA.
Fortunately. Of course one has always to accustom one's self to new
surroundings, Miss Tesman--little by little. [Looking towards the left.]
Oh, there the servant has gone and opened the veranda door, and let in a
whole flood of sunshine.
MISS TESMAN.
[Going towards the door.] Well, then we will shut it.
HEDDA.
No no, not that! Tesman, please draw the curtains. That will give a
softer light.
TESMAN.
[At the door.] All right--all right.--There now, Hedda, now you have
both shade and fresh air.
HEDDA.
Yes, fresh air we certainly must have, with all these stacks of
flowers--. But--won't you sit down, Miss Tesman?
MISS TESMAN.
No, thank you. Now that I have seen that everything is all right
here--thank heaven!--I must be getting home again. My sister is lying
longing for me, poor thing.
TESMAN.
Give her my very best love, Auntie; and say I shall look in and see her
later in the day.
MISS TESMAN.
Yes, yes, I'll be sure to tell her. But by-the-bye, George--[Feeling
in her dress pocket]--I had almost forgotten--I have something for you
here.
TESMAN.
What is it, Auntie? Eh?
MISS TESMAN.
[Produces a flat parcel wrapped in newspaper and hands it to him.] Look
here, my dear boy.
TESMAN.
[Opening the parcel.] Well, I declare!--Have you really saved
them for me, Aunt Julia! Hedda! isn't this touching--eh?
HEDDA.
[Beside the whatnot on the right.] Well, what is it?
TESMAN.
My old morning-shoes! My slippers.
HEDDA.
Indeed. I remember you often spoke of them while we were abroad.
TESMAN.
Yes, I missed them terribly. [Goes up to her.] Now you shall see them,
Hedda!
HEDDA.
[Going towards the stove.] Thanks, I really don't care about it.
TESMAN.
[Following her.] Only think--ill as she was, Aunt Rina embroidered these
for me. Oh you can't think how many associations cling to them.
HEDDA.
[At the table.] Scarcely for me.
MISS TESMAN.
Of course not for Hedda, George.
TESMAN.
Well, but now that she belongs to the family, I thought--
HEDDA.
[Interrupting.] We shall never get on with this servant, Tesman.
MISS TESMAN.
Not get on with Berta?
TESMAN.
Why, dear, what puts that in your head? Eh?
HEDDA.
[Pointing.] Look there! She has left her old bonnet lying about on a
chair.
TESMAN.
[In consternation, drops the slippers on the floor.] Why, Hedda--
HEDDA.
Just fancy, if any one should come in and see it!
TESMAN.
But Hedda--that's Aunt Julia's bonnet.
HEDDA.
Is it!
MISS TESMAN.
[Taking up the bonnet.] Yes, indeed it's mine. And, what's more, it's
not old, Madam Hedda.
