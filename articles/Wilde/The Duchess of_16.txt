MORANZONE
   Why are you here,
   If not to kill him, then?
GUIDO
   Lord Moranzone,
   I purpose to ascend to the Dukes chamber,
   And as he lies asleep lay on his breast
   The dagger and this writing; when he awakes
   Then he will know who held him in his power
   And slew him not: this is the noblest vengeance
   Which I can take.
MORANZONE
   You will not slay him?
GUIDO
   No.
MORANZONE
   Ignoble son of a noble father,
   Who sufferest this man who sold that father
   To live an hour.
GUIDO
   Twas thou that hindered me;
   I would have killed him in the open square,
   The day I saw him first.
MORANZONE
   It was not yet time;
   Now it is time, and, like some green-faced girl,
   Thou pratest of forgiveness.
GUIDO
   No! revenge:
   The right revenge my fathers son should take.
MORANZONE
   You are a coward,
   Take out the knife, get to the Dukes chamber,
   And bring me back his heart upon the blade.
   When he is dead, then you can talk to me
   Of noble vengeances.
GUIDO
   Upon thine honour,
   And by the love thou bearest my fathers name,
   Dost thou think my father, that great gentleman,
   That generous soldier, that most chivalrous lord,
   Would have crept at night-time, like a common thief,
   And stabbed an old man sleeping in his bed,
   However he had wronged him: tell me that.
MORANZONE
[after some hesitation]
   You have sworn an oath, see that you keep that oath.
   Boy, do you think I do not know your secret,
   Your traffic with the Duchess?
GUIDO
   Silence, liar!
   The very moon in heaven is not more chaste.
   Nor the white stars so pure.
MORANZONE
   And yet, you love her;
   Weak fool, to let love in upon your life,
   Save as a plaything.
GUIDO
   You do well to talk:
   Within your veins, old man, the pulse of youth
   Throbs with no ardour.  Your eyes full of rheum
   Have against Beauty closed their filmy doors,
   And your clogged ears, losing their natural sense,
   Have shut you from the music of the world.
   You talk of love!  You know not what it is.
MORANZONE
   Oh, in my time, boy, have I walked i the moon,
   Swore I would live on kisses and on blisses,
   Swore I would die for love, and did not die,
   Wrote love bad verses; ay, and sung them badly,
   Like all true lovers: Oh, I have done the tricks!
   I know the partings and the chamberings;
   We are all animals at best, and love
   Is merely passion with a holy name.
GUIDO
   Now then I know you have not loved at all.
   Love is the sacrament of life; it sets
   Virtue where virtue was not; cleanses men
   Of all the vile pollutions of this world;
   It is the fire which purges gold from dross,
   It is the fan which winnows wheat from chaff,
   It is the spring which in some wintry soil
   Makes innocence to blossom like a rose.
   The days are over when God walked with men,
   But Love, which is his image, holds his place.
   When a man loves a woman, then he knows
   Gods secret, and the secret of the world.
   There is no house so lowly or so mean,
   Which, if their hearts be pure who live in it,
   Love will not enter; but if bloody murder
   Knock at the Palace gate and is let in,
   Love like a wounded thing creeps out and dies.
   This is the punishment God sets on sin.
   The wicked cannot love.
