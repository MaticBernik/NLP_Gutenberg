LORD WINDERMERE.  Margaret! dont talk like that of Mrs. Erlynne, you
dont know how unjust it is!
LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Turning to him_.]  You are very jealous of Mrs.
Erlynnes honour.  I wish you had been as jealous of mine.
LORD WINDERMERE.  Your honour is untouched, Margaret.  You dont think
for a moment that[_Puts book back into desk_.]
LADY WINDERMERE.  I think that you spend your money strangely.  That is
all.  Oh, dont imagine I mind about the money.  As far as I am
concerned, you may squander everything we have.  But what I _do_ mind is
that you who have loved me, you who have taught me to love you, should
pass from the love that is given to the love that is bought.  Oh, its
horrible!  [_Sits on sofa_.]  And it is I who feel degraded! _you_ dont
feel anything.  I feel stained, utterly stained.  You cant realise how
hideous the last six months seems to me nowevery kiss you have given me
is tainted in my memory.
LORD WINDERMERE.  [_Crossing to her_.]  Dont say that, Margaret.  I
never loved any one in the whole world but you.
LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Rises_.]  Who is this woman, then?  Why do you take a
house for her?
LORD WINDERMERE.  I did not take a house for her.
LADY WINDERMERE.  You gave her the money to do it, which is the same
thing.
LORD WINDERMERE.  Margaret, as far as I have known Mrs. Erlynne
LADY WINDERMERE.  Is there a Mr. Erlynneor is he a myth?
LORD WINDERMERE.  Her husband died many years ago.  She is alone in the
world.
LADY WINDERMERE.  No relations?  [_A pause_.]
LORD WINDERMERE.  None.
LADY WINDERMERE.  Rather curious, isnt it?  [_L._]
LORD WINDERMERE.  [_L.C._]  Margaret, I was saying to youand I beg you
to listen to methat as far as I have known Mrs. Erlynne, she has
conducted herself well.  If years ago
LADY WINDERMERE.  Oh!  [_Crossing R.C._]  I dont want details about her
life!
LORD WINDERMERE.  [_C._]  I am not going to give you any details about
her life.  I tell you simply thisMrs. Erlynne was once honoured, loved,
respected.  She was well born, she had positionshe lost everythingthrew
it away, if you like.  That makes it all the more bitter.  Misfortunes
one can endurethey come from outside, they are accidents.  But to suffer
for ones own faultsah!there is the sting of life.  It was twenty years
ago, too.  She was little more than a girl then.  She had been a wife for
even less time than you have.
LADY WINDERMERE.  I am not interested in herandyou should not mention
this woman and me in the same breath.  It is an error of taste.
[_Sitting R. at desk_.]
LORD WINDERMERE.  Margaret, you could save this woman.  She wants to get
back into society, and she wants you to help her.  [_Crossing to her_.]
LADY WINDERMERE.  Me!
LORD WINDERMERE.  Yes, you.
LADY WINDERMERE.  How impertinent of her!  [_A pause_.]
LORD WINDERMERE.  Margaret, I came to ask you a great favour, and I still
ask it of you, though you have discovered what I had intended you should
never have known that I have given Mrs. Erlynne a large sum of money.  I
want you to send her an invitation for our party to-night.  [_Standing L.
of her_.]
