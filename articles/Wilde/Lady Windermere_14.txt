HOPPER.  I should like to have a chat with the Duke, Duchess.  He has not
said a single word to me yet.
DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  I think youll find he will have a great deal to say
to you to-morrow.  [_Exit_ LADY AGATHA _with_ MR. HOPPER.]  And now
good-night, Margaret.  Im afraid its the old, old story, dear.
Lovewell, not love at first sight, but love at the end of the season,
which is so much more satisfactory.
LADY WINDERMERE.  Good-night, Duchess.
[_Exit the_ DUCHESS OF BERWICK _on_ LORD PAISLEYS _arm_.]
LADY PLYMDALE.  My dear Margaret, what a handsome woman your husband has
been dancing with!  I should be quite jealous if I were you!  Is she a
great friend of yours?
LADY WINDERMERE.  No!
LADY PLYMDALE.  Really?  Good-night, dear.  [_Looks at_ MR. DUMBY _and
exit_.]
DUMBY.  Awful manners young Hopper has!
CECIL GRAHAM.  Ah!  Hopper is one of Natures gentlemen, the worst type
of gentleman I know.
DUMBY.  Sensible woman, Lady Windermere.  Lots of wives would have
objected to Mrs. Erlynne coming.  But Lady Windermere has that uncommon
thing called common sense.
CECIL GRAHAM.  And Windermere knows that nothing looks so like innocence
as an indiscretion.
DUMBY.  Yes; dear Windermere is becoming almost modern.  Never thought he
would.  [_Bows to_ LADY WINDERMERE _and exit_.]
LADY JEDBURGH.  Good night, Lady Windermere.  What a fascinating woman
Mrs. Erlynne is!  She is coming to lunch on Thursday, wont you come too?
I expect the Bishop and dear Lady Merton.
LADY WINDERMERE.  I am afraid I am engaged, Lady Jedburgh.
LADY JEDBURGH.  So sorry.  Come, dear.  [_Exeunt_ LADY JEDBURGH _and_
MISS GRAHAM.]
[_Enter_ MRS. ERLYNNE _and_ LORD WINDERMERE.]
MRS. ERLYNNE.  Charming ball it has been!  Quite reminds me of old days.
[_Sits on sofa_.]  And I see that there are just as many fools in society
as there used to be.  So pleased to find that nothing has altered!
Except Margaret.  Shes grown quite pretty.  The last time I saw
hertwenty years ago, she was a fright in flannel.  Positive fright, I
assure you.  The dear Duchess! and that sweet Lady Agatha!  Just the type
of girl I like!  Well, really, Windermere, if I am to be the Duchesss
sister-in-law
LORD WINDERMERE.  [_Sitting L. of her_.]  But are you?
[_Exit_ MR. CECIL GRAHAM _with rest of guests_.  LADY WINDERMERE
_watches_, _with a look of scorn and pain_, MRS. ERLYNNE _and her
husband_.  _They are unconscious of her presence_.]
MRS. ERLYNNE.  Oh, yes!  Hes to call to-morrow at twelve oclock!  He
wanted to propose to-night.  In fact he did.  He kept on proposing.  Poor
Augustus, you know how he repeats himself.  Such a bad habit!  But I told
him I wouldnt give him an answer till to-morrow.  Of course I am going
to take him.  And I dare say Ill make him an admirable wife, as wives
go.  And there is a great deal of good in Lord Augustus.  Fortunately it
is all on the surface.  Just where good qualities should be.  Of course
you must help me in this matter.
