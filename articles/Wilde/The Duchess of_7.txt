DUCHESS
   Poor people,
   You see I have no power with the Duke,
   But if you go into the court without,
   My almoner shall from my private purse,
   Divide a hundred ducats mongst you all.
FIRST CITIZEN
   God save the Duchess, say I.
SECOND CITIZEN
   God save her.
DUCHESS
   And every Monday morn shall bread be set
   For those who lack it.
                                          [_Citizens applaud and go out_.]
FIRST CITIZEN [_going out_]
   Why, God save the Duchess again!
DUKE [_calling him back_]
   Come hither, fellow! what is your name?
FIRST CITIZEN
   Dominick, sir.
DUKE
   A good name!  Why were you called Dominick?
FIRST CITIZEN [_scratching his head_]
   Marry, because I was born on St. Georges day.
DUKE
   A good reason! here is a ducat for you!
   Will you not cry for me God save the Duke?
FIRST CITIZEN [_feebly_]
   God save the Duke.
DUKE
   Nay! louder, fellow, louder.
FIRST CITIZEN [_a little louder_]
   God save the Duke!
DUKE
   More lustily, fellow, put more heart in it!
   Here is another ducat for you.
FIRST CITIZEN [_enthusiastically_]
   God save the Duke!
DUKE [_mockingly_]
   Why, gentlemen, this simple fellows love
   Touches me much.  [_To the Citizen_, _harshly_.]
   Go!  [_Exit Citizen_, _bowing_.]
   This is the way, my lords,
   You can buy popularity nowadays.
   Oh, we are nothing if not democratic!
                                                       [_To the_ DUCHESS.]
   Well, Madam,
   You spread rebellion midst our citizens.
DUCHESS
   My Lord, the poor have rights you cannot touch,
   The right to pity, and the right to mercy.
DUKE
   So, so, you argue with me?  This is she,
   The gentle Duchess for whose hand I yielded
   Three of the fairest towns in Italy,
   Pisa, and Genoa, and Orvieto.
DUCHESS
   Promised, my Lord, not yielded: in that matter
   Brake you your word as ever.
DUKE
   You wrong us, Madam,
   There were state reasons.
DUCHESS
   What state reasons are there
   For breaking holy promises to a state?
DUKE
   There are wild boars at Pisa in a forest
   Close to the city: when I promised Pisa
   Unto your noble and most trusting father,
   I had forgotten there was hunting there.
   At Genoa they say,
   Indeed I doubt them not, that the red mullet
   Runs larger in the harbour of that town
   Than anywhere in Italy.
                                          [_Turning to one of the Court_.]
   You, my lord,
   Whose gluttonous appetite is your only god,
   Could satisfy our Duchess on that point.
DUCHESS
   And Orvieto?
DUKE [_yawning_]
   I cannot now recall
   Why I did not surrender Orvieto
   According to the word of my contract.
   Maybe it was because I did not choose.
                                             [_Goes over to the_ DUCHESS.]
   Why look you, Madam, you are here alone;
   Tis many a dusty league to your grey France,
   And even there your father barely keeps
   A hundred ragged squires for his Court.
   What hope have you, I say?  Which of these lords
   And noble gentlemen of Padua
   Stands by your side.
DUCHESS
   There is not one.
                                [GUIDO _starts_, _but restrains himself_.]
DUKE
   Nor shall be,
   While I am Duke in Padua: listen, Madam,
   Being mine own, you shall do as I will,
   And if it be my will you keep the house,
   Why then, this palace shall your prison be;
   And if it be my will you walk abroad,
   Why, you shall take the air from morn to night.
