ACT III
                                  SCENE
_A large corridor in the Ducal Palace_: _a window_ (_L.C._) _looks out on
a view of Padua by moonlight_: _a staircase_ (_R.C._) _leads up to a door
with a portiere of crimson velvet_, _with the Dukes arms embroidered in
gold on it_: _on the lowest step of the staircase a figure draped in
black is sitting_: _the hall is lit by an iron cresset filled with
burning tow_: _thunder and lightning outside_: _the time is night_.
                  [_Enter_ GUIDO _through the window_.]
GUIDO
   The wind is rising: how my ladder shook!
   I thought that every gust would break the cords!
                                                [_Looks out at the city_.]
   Christ!  What a night:
   Great thunder in the heavens, and wild lightnings
   Striking from pinnacle to pinnacle
   Across the city, till the dim houses seem
   To shudder and to shake as each new glare
   Dashes adown the street.
                         [_Passes across the stage to foot of staircase_.]
   Ah! who art thou
   That sittest on the stair, like unto Death
   Waiting a guilty soul?  [_A pause_.]
   Canst thou not speak?
   Or has this storm laid palsy on thy tongue,
   And chilled thy utterance?
                              [_The figure rises and takes off his mask_.]
MORANZONE
   Guido Ferranti,
   Thy murdered father laughs for joy to-night.
GUIDO [_confusedly_]
   What, art thou here?
MORANZONE
   Ay, waiting for your coming.
GUIDO [_looking away from him_]
   I did not think to see you, but am glad,
   That you may know the thing I mean to do.
MORANZONE
   First, I would have you know my well-laid plans;
   Listen: I have set horses at the gate
   Which leads to Parma: when you have done your business
   We will ride hence, and by to-morrow night
GUIDO
   It cannot be.
MORANZONE
   Nay, but it shall.
GUIDO
   Listen, Lord Moranzone,
   I am resolved not to kill this man.
MORANZONE
   Surely my ears are traitors, speak again:
   It cannot be but age has dulled my powers,
   I am an old man now: what did you say?
   You said that with that dagger in your belt
   You would avenge your fathers bloody murder;
   Did you not say that?
GUIDO
   No, my lord, I said
   I was resolved not to kill the Duke.
MORANZONE
   You said not that; it is my senses mock me;
   Or else this midnight air oercharged with storm
   Alters your message in the giving it.
GUIDO
   Nay, you heard rightly; Ill not kill this man.
MORANZONE
   What of thine oath, thou traitor, what of thine oath?
GUIDO
   I am resolved not to keep that oath.
MORANZONE
   What of thy murdered father?
GUIDO
   Dost thou think
   My father would be glad to see me coming,
   This old mans blood still hot upon mine hands?
MORANZONE
   Ay! he would laugh for joy.
GUIDO
   I do not think so,
   There is better knowledge in the other world;
   Vengeance is Gods, let God himself revenge.
MORANZONE
   Thou art Gods minister of vengeance.
GUIDO
   No!
   God hath no minister but his own hand.
   I will not kill this man.
