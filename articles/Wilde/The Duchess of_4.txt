GUIDO
   Never more.
ASCANIO
   Must I go hence without a word of love?
GUIDO
   You must go hence, and may love go with you.
ASCANIO
   You are unknightly, and ungenerous.
GUIDO
   Unknightly and ungenerous if you will.
   Why should we waste more words about the matter
   Let us part now.
ASCANIO
   Have you no message, Guido?
GUIDO
   None; my whole past was but a schoolboys dream;
   To-day my life begins.  Farewell.
ASCANIO
   Farewell [_exit slowly_.]
GUIDO
   Now are you satisfied?  Have you not seen
   My dearest friend, and my most loved companion,
   Thrust from me like a common kitchen knave!
   Oh, that I did it!  Are you not satisfied?
MORANZONE
   Ay! I am satisfied.  Now I go hence,
   Do not forget the sign, your fathers dagger,
   And do the business when I send it to you.
GUIDO
   Be sure I shall.  [_Exit_ LORD MORANZONE.]
GUIDO
   O thou eternal heaven!
   If there is aught of nature in my soul,
   Of gentle pity, or fond kindliness,
   Wither it up, blast it, bring it to nothing,
   Or if thou wilt not, then will I myself
   Cut pity with a sharp knife from my heart
   And strangle mercy in her sleep at night
   Lest she speak to me.  Vengeance there I have it.
   Be thou my comrade and my bedfellow,
   Sit by my side, ride to the chase with me,
   When I am weary sing me pretty songs,
   When I am light o heart, make jest with me,
   And when I dream, whisper into my ear
   The dreadful secret of a fathers murder
   Did I say murder?  [_Draws his dagger_.]
   Listen, thou terrible God!
   Thou God that punishest all broken oaths,
   And bid some angel write this oath in fire,
   That from this hour, till my dear fathers murder
   In blood I have revenged, I do forswear
   The noble ties of honourable friendship,
   The noble joys of dear companionship,
   Affections bonds, and loyal gratitude,
   Ay, more, from this same hour I do forswear
   All love of women, and the barren thing
   Which men call beauty
[_The organ peals in the Cathedral_, _and under a canopy of cloth of
silver tissue_, _borne by four pages in scarlet_, _the_ DUCHESS OF PADUA
_comes down the steps_; _as she passes across their eyes meet for a
moment_, _and as she leaves the stage she looks back at_ GUIDO, _and the
dagger falls from his hand_.]
   Oh! who is that?
A CITIZEN
   The Duchess of Padua!

ACT II
                                  SCENE
_A state room in the Ducal Palace_, _hung with tapestries representing
the Masque of Venus_; _a large door in the centre opens into a corridor
of red marble_, _through which one can see a view of Padua_; _a large
canopy is set_ (_R.C._) _with three thrones_, _one a little lower than
the others_; _the ceiling is made of long gilded beams_; _furniture of
the period_, _chairs covered with gilt leather_, _and buffets set with
gold and silver plate_, _and chests painted with mythological scenes_.
_A number of the courtiers is out on the corridor looking from it down
into the street below_; _from the street comes the roar of a mob and
cries of_ _Death to the Duke_: _after a little interval enter the Duke
very calmly_; _he is leaning on the arm of Guido Ferranti_; _with him
enters also the Lord Cardinal_; _the mob still shouting_.
