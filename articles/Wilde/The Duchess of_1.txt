MORANZONE
   Poor boy, you never saw that noble father,
   For when by his false friend he had been sold,
   Alone of all his gentlemen I escaped
   To bear the news to Parma to the Duchess.
GUIDO
   Speak to me of my mother.
MORANZONE
   When thy mother
   Heard my black news, she fell into a swoon,
   And, being with untimely travail seized
   Bare thee into the world before thy time,
   And then her soul went heavenward, to wait
   Thy father, at the gates of Paradise.
GUIDO
   A mother dead, a father sold and bartered!
   I seem to stand on some beleaguered wall,
   And messenger comes after messenger
   With a new tale of terror; give me breath,
   Mine ears are tired.
MORANZONE
   When thy mother died,
   Fearing our enemies, I gave it out
   Thou wert dead also, and then privily
   Conveyed thee to an ancient servitor,
   Who by Perugia lived; the rest thou knowest.
GUIDO
   Saw you my father afterwards?
MORANZONE
   Ay! once;
   In mean attire, like a vineyard dresser,
   I stole to Rimini.
GUIDO [_taking his hand_]
   O generous heart!
MORANZONE
   One can buy everything in Rimini,
   And so I bought the gaolers! when your father
   Heard that a man child had been born to him,
   His noble face lit up beneath his helm
   Like a great fire seen far out at sea,
   And taking my two hands, he bade me, Guido,
   To rear you worthy of him; so I have reared you
   To revenge his death upon the friend who sold him.
GUIDO
   Thou hast done well; I for my father thank thee.
   And now his name?
MORANZONE
   How you remind me of him,
   You have each gesture that your father had.
GUIDO
   The traitors name?
MORANZONE
   Thou wilt hear that anon;
   The Duke and other nobles at the Court
   Are coming hither.
GUIDO
   What of that? his name?
MORANZONE
   Do they not seem a valiant company
   Of honourable, honest gentlemen?
GUIDO
   His name, milord?
[_Enter the_ DUKE OF PADUA _with_ COUNT BARDI, MAFFIO, PETRUCCI, _and
other gentlemen of his Court_.]
MORANZONE [_quickly_]
   The man to whom I kneel
   Is he who sold your father! mark me well.
GUIDO [_clutches hit dagger_]
   The Duke!
MORANZONE
   Leave off that fingering of thy knife.
   Hast thou so soon forgotten?  [_Kneels to the_ DUKE.]
   My noble Lord.
DUKE
   Welcome, Count Moranzone; tis some time
   Since we have seen you here in Padua.
   We hunted near your castle yesterday
   Call you it castle? that bleak house of yours
   Wherein you sit a-mumbling oer your beads,
   Telling your vices like a good old man.
                             [_Catches sight of_ GUIDO _and starts back_.]
   Who is that?
MORANZONE
   My sisters son, your Grace,
   Who being now of age to carry arms,
   Would for a season tarry at your Court
DUKE [_still looking at_ GUIDO]
   What is his name?
MORANZONE
   Guido Ferranti, sir.
DUKE
   His city?
MORANZONE
   He is Mantuan by birth.
DUKE [_advancing towards_ GUIDO]
   You have the eyes of one I used to know,
   But he died childless.  Are you honest, boy?
   Then be not spendthrift of your honesty,
   But keep it to yourself; in Padua
   Men think that honesty is ostentatious, so
   It is not of the fashion.  Look at these lords.
