LORD DARLINGTON.  You look faint.  Come out on the terrace.
LADY WINDERMERE.  Yes.  [_To_ PARKER.]  Parker, send my cloak out.
MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_Crossing to her_.]  Lady Windermere, how beautifully
your terrace is illuminated.  Reminds me of Prince Dorias at Rome.
[LADY WINDERMERE _bows coldly_, _and goes off with_ LORD DARLINGTON.]
Oh, how do you do, Mr. Graham?  Isnt that your aunt, Lady Jedburgh?  I
should so much like to know her.
CECIL GRAHAM.  [_After a moments hesitation and embarrassment_.]  Oh,
certainly, if you wish it.  Aunt Caroline, allow me to introduce Mrs.
Erlynne.
MRS. ERLYNNE.  So pleased to meet you, Lady Jedburgh.  [_Sits beside her
on the sofa_.]  Your nephew and I are great friends.  I am so much
interested in his political career.  I think hes sure to be a wonderful
success.  He thinks like a Tory, and talks like a Radical, and thats so
important nowadays.  Hes such a brilliant talker, too.  But we all know
from whom he inherits that.  Lord Allandale was saying to me only
yesterday, in the Park, that Mr. Graham talks almost as well as his aunt.
LADY JEDBURGH.  [_R._]  Most kind of you to say these charming things to
me!  [MRS. ERLYNNE _smiles_, _and continues conversation_.]
DUMBY.  [_To_ CECIL GRAHAM.]  Did you introduce Mrs. Erlynne to Lady
Jedburgh?
CECIL GRAHAM.  Had to, my dear fellow.  Couldnt help it!  That woman can
make one do anything she wants.  How, I dont know.
DUMBY.  Hope to goodness she wont speak to me!  [_Saunters towards_ LADY
PLYMDALE.]
MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_C._  _To_ LADY JEDBURGH.]  On Thursday?  With great
pleasure.  [_Rises_, _and speaks to_ LORD WINDERMERE, _laughing_.]  What
a bore it is to have to be civil to these old dowagers!  But they always
insist on it!
LADY PLYMDALE.  [_To_ MR. DUMBY.]  Who is that well-dressed woman talking
to Windermere?
DUMBY.  Havent got the slightest idea!  Looks like an _édition de luxe_
of a wicked French novel, meant specially for the English market.
MRS. ERLYNNE.  So that is poor Dumby with Lady Plymdale?  I hear she is
frightfully jealous of him.  He doesnt seem anxious to speak to me
to-night.  I suppose he is afraid of her.  Those straw-coloured women
have dreadful tempers.  Do you know, I think Ill dance with you first,
Windermere.  [LORD WINDERMERE _bits his lip and frowns_.]  It will make
Lord Augustus so jealous!  Lord Augustus!  [LORD AUGUSTUS _comes down_.]
Lord Windermere insists on my dancing with him first, and, as its his
own house, I cant well refuse.  You know I would much sooner dance with
you.
LORD AUGUSTUS.  [_With a low bow_.]  I wish I could think so, Mrs.
Erlynne.
MRS. ERLYNNE.  You know it far too well.  I can fancy a person dancing
through life with you and finding it charming.
LORD AUGUSTUS.  [_Placing his hand on his white waistcoat_.]  Oh, thank
you, thank you.  You are the most adorable of all ladies!
MRS. ERLYNNE.  What a nice speech!  So simple and so sincere!  Just the
sort of speech I like.  Well, you shall hold my bouquet.  [_Goes towards
ball-room on_ LORD WINDERMERES _arm_.]  Ah, Mr. Dumby, how are you?  I
am so sorry I have been out the last three times you have called.  Come
and lunch on Friday.
