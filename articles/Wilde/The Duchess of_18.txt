                     [_Pulls out a letter from his doublet and reads it_.]
   When he wakes,
   And sees this letter, and the dagger with it,
   Will he not have some loathing for his life,
   Repent, perchance, and lead a better life,
   Or will he mock because a young man spared
   His natural enemy?  I do not care.
   Father, it is thy bidding that I do,
   Thy bidding, and the bidding of my love
   Which teaches me to know thee as thou art.
[_Ascends staircase stealthily_, _and just as he reaches out his hand to
draw back the curtain the Duchess appears all in white_.  GUIDO _starts
back_.]
DUCHESS
   Guido! what do you here so late?
GUIDO
   O white and spotless angel of my life,
   Sure thou hast come from Heaven with a message
   That mercy is more noble than revenge?
DUCHESS
   There is no barrier between us now.
GUIDO
   None, love, nor shall be.
DUCHESS
   I have seen to that.
GUIDO
   Tarry here for me.
DUCHESS
   No, you are not going?
   You will not leave me as you did before?
GUIDO
   I will return within a moments space,
   But first I must repair to the Dukes chamber,
   And leave this letter and this dagger there,
   That when he wakes
DUCHESS
   When who wakes?
GUIDO
   Why, the Duke.
DUCHESS
   He will not wake again.
GUIDO
   What, is he dead?
DUCHESS
   Ay! he is dead.
GUIDO
   O God! how wonderful
   Are all thy secret ways!  Who would have said
   That on this very night, when I had yielded
   Into thy hands the vengeance that is thine,
   Thou with thy finger wouldst have touched the man,
   And bade him come before thy judgment seat.
DUCHESS
   I have just killed him.
GUIDO [_in horror_]
   Oh!
DUCHESS
   He was asleep;
   Come closer, love, and I will tell you all.
   I had resolved to kill myself to-night.
   About an hour ago I waked from sleep,
   And took my dagger from beneath my pillow,
   Where I had hidden it to serve my need,
   And drew it from the sheath, and felt the edge,
   And thought of you, and how I loved you, Guido,
   And turned to fall upon it, when I marked
   The old man sleeping, full of years and sin;
   There lay he muttering curses in his sleep,
   And as I looked upon his evil face
   Suddenly like a flame there flashed across me,
   There is the barrier which Guido spoke of:
   You said there lay a barrier between us,
   What barrier but he?
   I hardly know
   What happened, but a steaming mist of blood
   Rose up between us two.
GUIDO
   Oh, horrible!
DUCHESS
   And then he groaned,
   And then he groaned no more!  I only heard
   The dripping of the blood upon the floor.
GUIDO
   Enough, enough.
DUCHESS
   Will you not kiss me now?
   Do you remember saying that womens love
   Turns men to angels? well, the love of man
   Turns women into martyrs; for its sake
   We do or suffer anything.
GUIDO
   O God!
DUCHESS
   Will you not speak?
