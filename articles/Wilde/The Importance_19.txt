Algernon.  Ahem!  Cecily!  [Picking up hat.]  Your Rector here is, I
suppose, thoroughly experienced in the practice of all the rites and
ceremonials of the Church?
Cecily.  Oh, yes.  Dr. Chasuble is a most learned man.  He has never
written a single book, so you can imagine how much he knows.
Algernon.  I must see him at once on a most important christening--I mean
on most important business.
Cecily.  Oh!
Algernon.  I shan't be away more than half an hour.
Cecily.  Considering that we have been engaged since February the 14th,
and that I only met you to-day for the first time, I think it is rather
hard that you should leave me for so long a period as half an hour.
Couldn't you make it twenty minutes?
Algernon.  I'll be back in no time.
[Kisses her and rushes down the garden.]
Cecily.  What an impetuous boy he is!  I like his hair so much.  I must
enter his proposal in my diary.
[Enter Merriman.]
Merriman.  A Miss Fairfax has just called to see Mr. Worthing.  On very
important business, Miss Fairfax states.
Cecily.  Isn't Mr. Worthing in his library?
Merriman.  Mr. Worthing went over in the direction of the Rectory some
time ago.
Cecily.  Pray ask the lady to come out here; Mr. Worthing is sure to be
back soon.  And you can bring tea.
Merriman.  Yes, Miss.  [Goes out.]
Cecily.  Miss Fairfax!  I suppose one of the many good elderly women who
are associated with Uncle Jack in some of his philanthropic work in
London.  I don't quite like women who are interested in philanthropic
work.  I think it is so forward of them.
[Enter Merriman.]
Merriman.  Miss Fairfax.
[Enter Gwendolen.]
[Exit Merriman.]
Cecily.  [Advancing to meet her.]  Pray let me introduce myself to you.
My name is Cecily Cardew.
Gwendolen.  Cecily Cardew?  [Moving to her and shaking hands.]  What a
very sweet name!  Something tells me that we are going to be great
friends.  I like you already more than I can say.  My first impressions
of people are never wrong.
Cecily.  How nice of you to like me so much after we have known each
other such a comparatively short time.  Pray sit down.
Gwendolen.  [Still standing up.]  I may call you Cecily, may I not?
Cecily.  With pleasure!
Gwendolen.  And you will always call me Gwendolen, won't you?
Cecily.  If you wish.
Gwendolen.  Then that is all quite settled, is it not?
Cecily.  I hope so.  [A pause.  They both sit down together.]
Gwendolen.  Perhaps this might be a favourable opportunity for my
mentioning who I am.  My father is Lord Bracknell.  You have never heard
of papa, I suppose?
Cecily.  I don't think so.
Gwendolen.  Outside the family circle, papa, I am glad to say, is
entirely unknown.  I think that is quite as it should be.  The home seems
to me to be the proper sphere for the man.  And certainly once a man
begins to neglect his domestic duties he becomes painfully effeminate,
does he not?  And I don't like that.  It makes men so very attractive.
Cecily, mamma, whose views on education are remarkably strict, has
brought me up to be extremely short-sighted; it is part of her system; so
do you mind my looking at you through my glasses?
