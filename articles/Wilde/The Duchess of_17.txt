               [_A groan comes from the_ DUKES _chamber_.]
   Ah!  What is that?
   Do you not hear?  Twas nothing.
   So I think
   That it is womans mission by their love
   To save the souls of men: and loving her,
   My Lady, my white Beatrice, I begin
   To see a nobler and a holier vengeance
   In letting this man live, than doth reside
   In bloody deeds o night, stabs in the dark,
   And young hands clutching at a palsied throat.
   It was, I think, for loves sake that Lord Christ,
   Who was indeed himself incarnate Love,
   Bade every man forgive his enemy.
MORANZONE [_sneeringly_]
   That was in Palestine, not Padua;
   And said for saints: I have to do with men.
GUIDO
   It was for all time said.
MORANZONE
   And your white Duchess,
   What will she do to thank you?
GUIDO
   Alas, I will not see her face again.
   Tis but twelve hours since I parted from her,
   So suddenly, and with such violent passion,
   That she has shut her heart against me now:
   No, I will never see her.
MORANZONE
   What will you do?
GUIDO
   After that I have laid the dagger there,
   Get hence to-night from Padua.
MORANZONE
   And then?
GUIDO
   I will take service with the Doge at Venice,
   And bid him pack me straightway to the wars,
   And there I will, being now sick of life,
   Throw that poor life against some desperate spear.
                              [_A groan from the_ DUKES _chamber again_.]
   Did you not hear a voice?
MORANZONE
   I always hear,
   From the dim confines of some sepulchre,
   A voice that cries for vengeance.  We waste time,
   It will be morning soon; are you resolved
   You will not kill the Duke?
GUIDO
   I am resolved.
MORANZONE
   O wretched father, lying unavenged.
GUIDO
   More wretched, were thy son a murderer.
MORANZONE
   Why, what is life?
GUIDO
   I do not know, my lord,
   I did not give it, and I dare not take it.
MORANZONE
   I do not thank God often; but I think
   I thank him now that I have got no son!
   And you, what bastard blood flows in your veins
   That when you have your enemy in your grasp
   You let him go!  I would that I had left you
   With the dull hinds that reared you.
GUIDO
   Better perhaps
   That you had done so!  May be better still
   Id not been born to this distressful world.
MORANZONE
   Farewell!
GUIDO
   Farewell!  Some day, Lord Moranzone,
   You will understand my vengeance.
MORANZONE
   Never, boy.
                           [_Gets out of window and exit by rope ladder_.]
GUIDO
   Father, I think thou knowest my resolve,
   And with this nobler vengeance art content.
   Father, I think in letting this man live
   That I am doing what thou wouldst have done.
   Father, I know not if a human voice
   Can pierce the iron gateway of the dead,
   Or if the dead are set in ignorance
   Of what we do, or do not, for their sakes.
   And yet I feel a presence in the air,
   There is a shadow standing at my side,
   And ghostly kisses seem to touch my lips,
   And leave them holier.  [_Kneels down_.]
   O father, if tis thou,
   Canst thou not burst through the decrees of death,
   And if corporeal semblance show thyself,
   That I may touch thy hand!
   No, there is nothing.  [_Rises_.]
   Tis the night that cheats us with its phantoms,
   And, like a puppet-master, makes us think
   That things are real which are not.  It grows late.
   Now must I to my business.
