MRS. BORKMAN.
  She is unusually intelligent; remarkably clear in her judgments.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  In her judgments of people, do you mean?
MRS. BORKMAN.
  Yes, principally of people.  She has made quite a study of
Erhart; looked deep into his character--into his soul.  And
the result is she idolises him, as she could not help doing.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [With a touch of finesse.]  Then perhaps she knows Erhart still
better than she knows you?
MRS. BORKMAN.
  Yes, Erhart saw a good deal of her in town, before she came
out here.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Without thinking.]  And in spite of that she moved out of town?
MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Taken aback, looking keenly at her.]  In spite of that!  What
do you mean?
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Evasively.]  Oh, nothing particular.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  You said it strangely--you did mean something by it, Ella!
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Looking her straight in the eyes.]  Yes, that is true, Gunhild!
I did mean something by it.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  Well, then, say it right out.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  First let me tell you, I think I too have a certain claim upon
Erhart.  Do you think I haven't?
MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Glancing round the room.]  No doubt--after all the money you
have spent upon him.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Oh, not on that account, Gunhild.  But because I love him.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Smiling scornfully.]  Love my son?  Is it possible?  You?  In
spite of everything?
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Yes, it is possible--in spite of everything.  And it is true.
I love Erhart--as much as I can love any one--now--at my time of
life.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  Well, well, suppose you do: what then?
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Why, then, I am troubled as soon as I see anything threatening
him.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  Threatening Erhart!  Why, what should threaten him?  Or who?
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  You in the first place--in your way.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Vehemently.]  I!
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  And then this Mrs. Wilton, too, I am afraid.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Looks at her for a moment in speechless surprise.]  And you
think such things of Erhart!  Of my own boy!  He, who has his
great mission to fulfil!
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Lightly.]  Oh, his mission!
MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Indignantly.]  How dare you say that so scornfully?
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Do you think a young man of Erhart's age, full of health and
spirits--do you think he is going to sacrifice himself for--for
such a thing as a "mission"?
MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Firmly and emphatically.]  Erhart will!  I know he will.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Shaking her head.]  You neither know it nor believe it, Gunhild.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  I don't believe it!
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  It is only a dream that you cherish.  For if you hadn't that to
cling to, you feel that you would utterly despair.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  Yes, indeed I should despair.  [Vehemently.]  And I daresay that
is what you would like to see, Ella!
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [With head erect.]  Yes, I would rather see that than see you
"redeem" yourself at Erhart's expense.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Threateningly.]  You want to come between us?  Between mother
and son?  You?
