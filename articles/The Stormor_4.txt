Let him that doubts the Truth of this, examine a little the Particulars;
let him stand upon _Shooters-Hill_ in _Kent_, and view the Mouth of the
River _Thames_, and consider what a River it must be when none of the
Marshes on either side were wall'd in from the Sea, and when the Sea
without all question flow'd up to the Foot of the Hills on either Shore,
and up every Creek, where he must allow is now dry Land on either side
the River for two Miles in breadth at least, sometimes three or four,
for above forty Miles on both sides the River.
Let him farther reflect, how all these Parts lay when, as our ancient
Histories relate, the _Danish_ Fleet came up almost to _Hartford_, so
that all that Range of fresh Marshes which reach for twenty five Miles
in length, from _Ware_ to the River _Thames_, must be a Sea.
In short, Let any such considering Person imagine the vast Tract of
Marsh-Lands on both sides the River _Thames_, to _Harwich_ on the
_Essex_ side, and to _Whitstable_ on the _Kentish_ side, the Levels of
Marshes up the _Stour_ from _Sandwich_ to _Canterbury_, the whole Extent
of Lowgrounds commonly call'd _Rumney-Marsh_, from _Hythe_ to
_Winchelsea_, and up the Banks of the _Rother_; all which put together,
and being allow'd to be in one place cover'd with Water, what a Lake
wou'd it be suppos'd to make? According to the nicest Calculations I can
make, it cou'd not amount to less than 500000 Acres of Land.
The Isle of _Ely_, with the _Flats_ up the several Rivers from
_Yarmouth_ to _Norwich_, _Beccles_, &c. the continu'd Levels in the
several Counties of _Norfolk_, _Cambridge_, _Suffolk_, _Huntingdon_,
_Northampton_, and _Lincoln_, I believe do really contain as much Land
as the whole County of _Norfolk_; and 'tis not many Ages since these
Counties were universally one vast Moras or Lough, and the few solid
parts wholly unapproachable: insomuch that the Town of _Ely_ it self was
a Receptacle for the Malecontents of the Nation, where no reasonable
Force cou'd come near to dislodge them.
'Tis needless to reckon up twelve or fourteen like Places in _England_,
as the Moores in _Somersetshire_, the Flat-shores in _Lancashire_,
_Yorkshire_, and _Durham_, the like in _Hampshire_ and _Sussex_; and in
short, on the Banks of every Navigable River.
The sum of the matter is this; That while this Nation was thus full of
standing Lakes, stagnated Waters, and moist Places, the multitude of
Exhalations must furnish the Air with a quantity of Matter for Showers
and Storms infinitely more than it can be now supply'd withal, those
vast Tracts of Land being now fenc'd off, laid dry, and turn'd into
wholsome and profitable Provinces.
This seems demonstrated from _Ireland_, where the multitude of Loughs,
Lakes, Bogs, and moist Places, serve the Air with Exhalations, which
give themselves back again in Showers, and make it be call'd, _The
Piss-pot of the World_.
The imaginary Notion I have to advance on this Head, amounts only to a
Reflection upon the Skill of those Ages in the Art of Navigation; which
being far short of what it is since arrived to, made these vast Northern
Seas too terrible for them to venture in: and accordingly, they rais'd
those Apprehensions up to Fable, which began only in their want of
Judgment.
