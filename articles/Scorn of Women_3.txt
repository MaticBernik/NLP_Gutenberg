MRS. McFEE
_(With more than usual asperity.)_
And how comes it Mr. Prince should know the children of sin and still
be company for decent bodies?
MRS. EPPINGWELL
Because he is a man, I imagine.
_(Mrs. McFee snorts.)_
There is Sitka Charley. I suppose you would bar him if he wanted to
come?
MRS. MCFEE
_(Judicially.)_
Why, no, he's a verra good soul.
MRS. EPPINGWELL
Yet I'm sure he knows all the children of sin, you call them.
MRS. McFEE
But he's an Indian, and he doesna dance.
MRS. EPPINGWELL
_(Laughing.)_
Then I suppose I shall not shock you by speaking to him.
_(Approaches Sitka Charley, while Mrs. McFee goes to counter and is
waited on by a clerk.)_
Good morning, Charley. Have you seen Captain Eppingwell?
SITKA CHARLEY
_(Nodding good morning.)_
Yes.
Mrs. Eppingwell How long ago? Was he here?
SITKA CHARLEY
I see um last night.
MRS. EPPINGWELL
Oh!
_(Laughing.)_
I've seen him later than that. But he was to meet me here.
SITKA CHARLEY
Um.
MRS. EPPINGWELL
_(Trying to make conversation.)_
It is rather cold this morning.
Um.
SITKA CHARLEY
MRS. EPPINGWELL
How cold?
SITKA CHARLEY
Sixty-five below. Any dogs to sell?
MRS. EPPINGWELL
Still trying to buy dogs! For whom this time? Sitka Charley
Vanderlip. He want eight dogs.
MRS. EPPINGWELL
_(Startled and interested.)_ Mr. Vanderlip?
Um.
SITKA CHARLEY
Mrs. Eppingwell What does he want with dogs?
Sitka Charley Um. Got dogs?
MRS. EPPINGWELL
_(A sudden thought striking her.)_
Yes, I've dogs to sell. Or rather, Captain Eppingwell has.
SITKA CHARLEY
Fresh dogs? Strong dogs?
MRS. EPPINGWELL
_(Considering.)_
Well, no. You see, he just arrived yesterday. It was a long trip.
SITKA CHARLEY
Yes, me know--sixteen hundred miles. Dogs all bones, all played out,
no good.
MRS. EPPINGWELL
How soon does he want the dogs?
SITKA CHARLEY
Right away, now, to-day.
MRS. EPPINGWELL
What does he want the dogs for?
SITKA CHARLEY
_(Stolidly.)_
Um?
MRS. EPPINGWELL
What does Mr. Vanderlip want the dogs for?
SITKA CHARLEY
That no Sitka Charley's business. That Vanderlip's business.
MRS. EPPINGWELL
But I want to know.
SITKA CHARLEY
Then you ask Vanderlip.
MRS. EPPINGWELL
Tell me.
SITKA CHARLEY
Much better you ask Vanderlip, I think so.
_(A pause, during which Sitka Charley merely waits, while Mrs.
Eppingwell seems to be thinking. When she speaks, it is in a changed,
serious tone.)_
MRS. EPPINGWELL
Charley, we have travelled the Long Trail together, you and I.
SITKA CHARLEY
Um.
MRS. EPPINGWELL
We journeyed through the Hills of Silence. We saw our last dogs drop
in the traces. We staggered and fell, and crawled on our hands and
knees through the snow because we had not enough to eat, and it was
very cold. We had our last food stolen--
SITKA CHARLEY
_(Eyes flashing, face stiffening, grimly and with satisfaction.)_
Captain Eppingwell kill one man who steal food. I kill other man. I
know.
MRS. EPPINGWELL
_(Shuddering.)_
Yes, it was terrible. But we kept the faith of food and blanket, you
and I, Charley.
