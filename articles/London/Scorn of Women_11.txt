SITKA CHARLEY
Sure. And um hard like iron sometimes. But um no like you. Um say so.
What for um no like you?
FREDA
_(Gently.)_
No woman likes me, Charley.
SITKA CHARLEY
All men like you.
FREDA
_(With touch of anger.)_
All men are fools.
SITKA CHARLEY
What for womans no like you?
FREDA
_(Meditatively)_.
And she likes Vanderlip. How do you know? What do you know?
SITKA CHARLEY
No can tell. I promise.
FREDA
Promised whom?
SITKA CHARLEY
Mrs. Eppingwell. Um Mrs. Eppingwell very good woman.
FREDA
But she has a husband. It is not good for her to like another man.
What do you think?
SITKA CHARLEY
_(Perplexedly.)_
I think I don't know. I think all um womans crazy. What for all um
womans like this Vanderlip man?
FREDA
_(Decisively.)_
Well, I don't.
SITKA CHARLEY
_(Sceptically.)_
Um.
FREDA
Let me show you, Charley, and then you will know why I want you to
help me. And, remember, you mustn't tell a word of any of this to any
one.
SITKA CHARLEY
_(Debating the proposition.)_
Um--maybe I tell Mrs. Eppingwell.
FREDA
_(Angrily.)_
Don't be silly, Charley. You mustn't tell anybody. Promise me now.
SITKA CHARLEY
_(With despairing perplexity.)_ All right, I no tell.
FREDA
Now this little girl is coming in over the ice--her name is Flossie.
She has lived a soft life down in California, where the sun is warm
and there is no snow. She does not know hardship, nor the trail, and
she is having a hard time now on the trail. Think of it!--sixty-five
degrees below zero this morning, and she is out in it, walking,
walking, walking, her breath freezing, her mouth icing up, her
eyebrows rimed with frost. And she is very stiff, and sore, and tired.
Every step of the trail she takes in pain. It is like a bad dream
to her, Charley. But she sees, always before her, at the end of the
dream, an awakening at Dawson, in the arms of the man who is to marry
her. But, Charley, what if when she gets to Dawson there is no Floyd
Vanderlip? no man to marry her? It will break her heart. It will be no
happy awakening from a bad dream, but the beginning of a worse dream.
And she is a little girl, Charley--not a strong woman like me who does
not care. She will care, and she will know nobody, and she will cry,
and cry, and cry. Did you ever hear a woman cry, Charley? Think of it,
she is only a little girl.
SITKA CHARLEY
Um. More like baby.
FREDA
Yes, put it that way, more like a baby. She cannot stand pain.
SITKA CHARLEY
Oh, on trail, too much walk make um hurt.
FREDA
No, no.
_(Holds hand to heart.)_
Pain here.
SITKA CHARLEY
Um. I know. Um sick. What um call heart disease. I see one man sick
that way. Um fall down dead, just like that.
FREDA
_(Irritably.)_
Oh, you don't understand.
