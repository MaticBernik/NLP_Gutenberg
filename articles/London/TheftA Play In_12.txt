(_Knox shakes his head with a quiet smile._)
{Margaret}
Oh, Tom, be truthful. You don't hope anything of the sort. You
know you are hoping to destroy him.
{Chalmers}
(_Smiling grimly._) That is what usually happens to those who are
not won over.
(_Preparing to depart with cup of tea; speaking to Knox._) You
might accomplish much good, were you with us. Against us you
accomplish nothing, absolutely nothing.
(_Returns to Dolores Ortega._)
{Margaret}
(_Hurriedly._) You see. That is why I was anxious--why I sent
for you. Even Tom admits that they who are not won over are
destroyed. This speech is a crucial event. You know how rigidly
they rule the House and gag men like you. It is they, and they
alone, who have given you opportunity for this speech? Why?--Why?
{Knox}
(_Smiling confidently._) I know their little scheme. They have
heard my charges. They think I am going to make a firebrand
speech, and they are ready to catch me without the proofs. They
are ready in every way for me. They are going to laugh me down.
The Associated Press, the Washington correspondents--all are
ready to manufacture, in every newspaper in the land, the great
laugh that will destroy me. But I am fully prepared, I have--
{Margaret}
The proofs?
{Knox}
Yes.
{Margaret}
Now?
{Knox}
They will be delivered to me to-night--original documents,
photographs of documents, affidavits--
{Margaret}
Tell me nothing. But oh, do be careful! Be careful!
{Mrs. Dowsett}
(_Appealing to Margaret._) Do give me some assistance, Mrs.
Chalmers.
(_Indicating Sakari._) Mr. Sakari is trying to make me ridiculous.
{Margaret}
Impossible.
{Mrs. Dowsett}
But he is. He has had the effrontery--
{Chalmers}
(_Mimicking Mrs. Dowsett._) Effrontery!--O, Sakari!
{Sakari}
The dear lady is pleased to be facetious.
{Mrs. Dowsett}
He has had the effrontery to ask me to explain the cause of high
prices. Mr. Dowsett says the reason is that the people are living
so high.
{Sakari}
Such a marvelous country. They are poor because they have so much
to spend.
{Chalmers}
Are not high prices due to the increased output of gold?
{Mrs. Dowsett}
Mr. Sakari suggested that himself, and when I agreed with him he
proceeded to demolish it. He has treated me dreadfully.
{Rutland}
(_Clearing his throat and expressing himself with ponderous
unction._) You will find the solution in the drink traffic. It
is liquor, alcohol, that is undermining our industry, our
institutions, our faith in God--everything. Yearly the working
people drink greater quantities of alcohol. Naturally, through
resulting inefficiency, the cost of production is higher, and
therefore prices are higher.
{Dowsett}
Partly so, partly so. And in line with it, and in addition to it,
prices are high because the working class is no longer thrifty.
If our working class saved as the French peasant does, we would
sell more in the world market and have better times.
{Sakari} (_Bowing._) As I understand it then, the more thrifty you
are the more you save, and the more you save the more you have to
sell, the more you sell, the better the times?
