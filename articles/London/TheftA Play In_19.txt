(_Tommy enters from left, evidently playing a game, in the course
of which he is running away. By his actions he shows that he is
pursued. He intends to cross stage, but is stopped by sight of
the men. Unobserved by them, he retraces his steps and crawls
under the tea-table._)
{Chalmers}
Without doubt, Knox is in possession of the letters right now.
{Starkweather}
There is but one thing to do, and that is--get them back.
(_He looks questioningly at the two men._)
(_Margaret enters from left, in flushed and happy pursuit of
Tommy--for it is a game she is playing with him. She startles at
sight of the three men, whom she first sees as she gains the side
of the tea-table, where she pauses abruptly, resting one hand on
the table._)
{Hubbard}
I'll undertake it.
{Starkweather}
There is little time to waste. In twenty hours from now he will
be on the floor making his speech. Try mild measures first. Offer
him inducements--any inducement. I empower you to act for me. You
will find he has a price.
{Hubbard}
And if not?
{Starkweather}
Then you must get them at any cost.
{Hubbard}
(_Tentatively._) You mean--?
{Starkweather}
I mean just that. But no matter what happens, I must never be
brought in. Do you understand?
{Hubbard}
Thoroughly.
{Margaret}
(_Acting her part, and speaking with assumed gayety._) What are you
three conspiring about? (_All three men are startled._)
{Chalmers}
We are arranging to boost prices a little higher.
{Hubbard}
And so be able to accumulate more motorcars.
{Starkweather}
(_Taking no notice of Margaret and starting toward exit to rear._)
I must be going. Hubbard, you have your work cut out for you.
Tom, I want you to come with me.
{Chalmers}
(_As the three men move toward exit._) Home?
{Starkweather}
Yes, we have much to do.
{Chalmers}
Then I'll dress first and follow you.
(_Turning to Margaret._) Pick me up on the way to that dinner.
(_Margaret nods. Starkweather makes exit without speaking.
Hub-bard says good-bye to Margaret and makes exit, followed by
Chalmers._)
(_Margaret remains standing, one hand resting on table, the other
hand to her breast. She is thinking, establishing in her mind
the connection between Knox and what she has overheard, and in
process of reaching the conclusion that Knox is in danger._)
(_Tommy, having vainly waited to be discovered, crawls out
dispiritedly, and takes Margaret by the hand. She scarcely
notices him._)
{Tommy} (_Dolefully._) Don't you want to play any more? (_Margaret
does not reply_). I was a good Indian.
{Margaret}
(_Suddenly becoming aware of herself and breaking down. She stoops
and clasps Tommy in her arms, crying out, in anxiety and fear,
and from love of her boy._) Oh, Tommy! Tommy!
