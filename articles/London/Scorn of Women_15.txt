CURTAIN
ACT II--ANTEROOM OF PIONEER HALL
Scene. _Anteroom of Pioneer Hall. It is ten-thirty P.M. The room is
large and bare. Its walls are of logs, stuffed between with brown
moss. Street door to rear, in centre. Doors, window-frames, and sashes
of rough, unstained pine boards. At one side of door is wisp-broom for
brushing snow from moccasins. On either side of door is an ordinary
small-paned window, and beneath either window is a rough wooden bench.
Under benches are large out-door moccasins, left there after the
manner of overshoes, by their owners. In available space on rear wall,
many wooden pegs, on which are hanging furs, parkas, hats, wraps, etc.
Midway between front and rear, and at equal distances between centre
and sides, running at full blast, are two large wood-burning stoves.
Alongside each stove is a wood-box filled with firewood. On right, a
window. On left, wide doorway, open, connecting with ballroom. Through
doorway come occasional snatches of dance-music, bursts of laughter
and of voices. Because it is very cold, street door is kept closed,
and is opened by doorkeeper only when some one knocks, and then only
long enough for that one to enter. All parleying is done on inside
with door closed. Prince, as doorkeeper, is standing at rear by street
door. Men and women, in costume, are disappearing through door to
left, from where come strains of a waltz._
PRINCE
_(Drawing up his shoulders, as if cold.)_ B-r-r!
_(Crosses rapidly to lejt and peers through doorway into ballroom,
looking jor somebody. Holds up his finger and beckons.)_ Here, you,
Billy! More fire! Hi yu skookum fire!
_(Enter Indian, who proceeds to fire up both stoves.)_
_(Prince stands looking into ballroom. A knock is heard at street
door. He returns and opens door.)_
_(A Man enters, masked and in heavy fur overcoat.)_
PRINCE
_(Hastily closing door.)_
Hello.
_(The Man hesitates, looks around, and starts to cross to left.)_
PRINCE
_(Plucking him by the arm.)_
Well?
MAN
_(Pausing, and then, as if discovering reason for his detention.)_
Oh!
_(Sits down on bench and proceeds to remove moccasins.)_
PRINCE
Masks must be lifted at the door, you know.
MAN
_(In muffled voice.)_
And give myself away? Oh, no.
PRINCE
The doorkeeper's lips are sealed. I give nobody's identity away. Come
on, let's see who you are.
_(Reaches out and lifts mask.)_
Jack Denison!
MAN
_(In clear voice.)_
Yours truly, Prince, my boy.
PRINCE
But you can't come in here, old man.
MAN
And why not?
PRINCE
_(Stuttering and stammering.)_
Why--I--they're damned select--it's the women, you know--and
I--they--well, they made me doorkeeper, and--
_(Breaking down.)_
--you know well enough yourself, Jack.
MAN
_(Rising as though to go, and in angry tones.)_ By God, you can come
down to Jack Denison's joint all right, and buck Jack Denison's faro
layout all right, and have a social drink with him all right; but
when Jack Denison comes up to your doings, you turn'm down like he had
smallpox.
