VANDERLIP
_(Anxiety going out of face, being replaced by satisfaction.)_
Oh, you're all right, Loraine, you bet.
LORAINE
But you must leave me now, Floyd. Somebody may come in at any moment.
Besides, I've a few little things to buy for our journey.
VANDERLIP
And they're fixing my money for me in there.
_(Nodding toward door at lejt. Loraine betrays keen and involuntary
interest)_. Letters of credit, you know, and all that. Can't carry
much dust. Too heavy. And by the way, keep the weight down. Don't buy
too many little things. Dogs are dogs, and they can only haul so much.
LORAINE
Only enough for me to be comfortable.
VANDERLIP
A woman needs so almighty much to be comfortable. But it'll be all
right. Two sleds'll carry us, no matter how comfortable you make
yourself. Bring plenty of foot-gear, moccasins, and stockings, and
such things. And be at the water-hole at midnight with your whole
outfit. Be sure that Indian of yours has enough dog food. I'll get my
dogs to-day some time.
LORAINE
Which water-hole?
VANDERLIP
The one by the hospital. Don't make a mistake and go to the other one.
It's way out of the way.
LORAINE
And now you simply must leave me. And you mustn't see me again
to-day--not till midnight, at the water-hole, by the hospital. You
know I can scarcely bear to have you out of my sight. But these
women--oh, they are such suspicious creatures!
VANDERLIP
Good-by, then, until to-night.
_(Turns to go toward left.)_
LORAINE
_(Softly.)_
Floyd!
_(Vanderlip turns back.)_
You must go to the ball to-night. I've begged off, but you must go. It
will avert any possible suspicion.
VANDERLIP
I was going anyway, just to drop in for a while. I--that is, you
see--I promised Mrs. Eppingwell I'd go.
LORAINE
_(Jealously.)_ Mrs. Eppingwell!
VANDERLIP
Of course, but it's all right, Loraine. She don't count.
LORAINE
Of course not. But then, Floyd, I care so much for you that I can't
help a little jealousy--but there, there, you _must_ go. Good-by,
dear.
VANDERLIP
Good-by dear, dear Loraine. _(Turns to go toward left.)_
LORAINE
_(Softly.)_ Floyd!
VANDERLIP
_(Turns back, waits, and after a pause.)_ Well?
LORAINE
_(With sweet reproof.)_
I've been hearing things about you, sir.
VANDERLIP
What's up now?
LORAINE
Oh, you seem to have--how shall I say!--a penchant for foreigners.
VANDERLIP
_(Mystified.)_
Darned if I know what you're talking about. Penchant--is that
something to eat?
LORAINE
_(Laughing.)_
Well, then, there is a certain woman, supposed to be Greek, at any
rate a foreigner like myself; but with the most adorable accent--or so
the men say--
VANDERLIP
_(Interrupting.)_
Freda, you mean.
LORAINE
_(Fastidious expression on face.)_
Yes, I believe that is the woman's name.
Vanderlip _(Laughing jovially.)_
There ain't anything in it. I don't care a rap for her--not a rap.
LORAINE
Then there's that Mrs. Eppingwell. I can't help thinking you are a
little devoted to her.
VANDERLIP
_(Showing slight embarrassment.)_
Oh, well, I've only seen her in a social way--that's all, in a social
way.
