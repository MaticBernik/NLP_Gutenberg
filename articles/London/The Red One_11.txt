Whats the matter with it as a nugget?  I demanded.
The remote, indwelling expression went out of his eyes as he boomed
Why, its size.
It does seem large, I admitted.  But theres no doubt its authentic.
The Australian Government would scarcely dare
Large! he interrupted, with a sniff and a sneer.
Largest ever discovered I started on.
Ever discovered!  His dim eyes smouldered hotly as he proceeded.  Do
you think that every lump of gold ever discovered has got into the
newspapers and encyclopedias?
Well, I replied judicially, if theres one that hasnt, I dont see
how were to know about it.  If a really big nugget, or nugget-finder,
elects to blush unseen
But it didnt, he broke in quickly.  I saw it with my own eyes, and,
besides, Im too tanned to blush anyway.  Im a railroad man and Ive
been in the tropics a lot.  Why, I used to be the colour of mahoganyreal
old mahogany, and have been taken for a blue-eyed Spaniard more than
once
It was my turn to interrupt, and I did.
Was that nugget bigger than those in there, Mr.er?
Jones, Julian Jones is my name.
He dug into an inner pocket and produced an envelope addressed to such a
person, care of General Delivery, San Francisco; and I, in turn,
presented him with my card.
Pleased to know you, sir, he said, extending his hand, his voice
booming as if accustomed to loud noises or wide spaces.  Of course Ive
heard of you, seen your picture in the papers, and all that, and, though
I say it that shouldnt, I want to say that I didnt care a rap about
those articles you wrote on Mexico.  Youre wrong, all wrong.  You make
the mistake of all Gringos in thinking a Mexican is a white man.  He
aint.  None of them aintGreasers, Spiggoties, Latin-Americans and all
the rest of the cattle.  Why, sir, they dont think like we think, or
reason, or act.  Even their multiplication table is different.  You think
seven times seven is forty-nine; but not them.  They work it out
different.  And white isnt white to them, either.  Let me give you an
example.  Buying coffee retail for house-keeping in one-pound or
ten-pound lots
How big was that nugget you referred to? I queried firmly.  As big as
the biggest of those?
Bigger, he said quietly.  Bigger than the whole blamed exhibit of them
put together, and then some.  He paused and regarded me with a steadfast
gaze.  I dont see no reason why I shouldnt go into the matter with
you.  Youve got a reputation a man ought to be able to trust, and Ive
read youve done some tall skylarking yourself in out-of-the-way places.
Ive been browsing around with an eye open for some one to go in with me
on the proposition.
You can trust me, I said.
And here I am, blazing out into print with the whole story just as he
told it to me as we sat on a bench by the lagoon before the Palace of
Fine Arts with the cries of the sea gulls in our ears.  Well, he should
have kept his appointment with me.  But I anticipate.
