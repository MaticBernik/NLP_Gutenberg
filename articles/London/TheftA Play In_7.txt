{Dowsett}
(_Angrily._) I refuse to be treated in this manner, Mr.
Starkweather. I have some self-respect--
(_Starkweather grunts incredulously._) Some decency--
(_Starkweather grunts._) A position of prominence in my state.
You forget, sir, that in our state organization I occupy no mean
place.
{Starkweather}
(_Cutting him off so sharply that Dowsett drops cup and saucer._)
Don't you show your teeth to me. I can make you or break you.
That state organization of yours belongs to me.
(_Dowsett starts--he is learning something new. To hide his
feelings, he stoops to pick up cup and saucer._) Let it alone! I
am talking to you.
(_Dowsett straightens up to attention with alacrity._) (_Connie,
who has witnessed, rings for Servant._) I bought that state
organization, and paid for it. You are one of the chattels that
came along with the machine. You were made senator to obey my
orders. Understand? Do you understand?
{Dowsett}
(_Beaten._) I--I understand.
{Starkweather}
That bill is to be killed.
{Dowsett}
Yes, sir.
{Starkweather}
Quietly, no headlines about it.
(_Dowsett nods._) Now you can go.
(_Dowsett proceeds rather limply across to join group at
tea-table._) (_Chalmers and Hubbard enter from right, laughing
about something. At sight of Starkweather they immediately become
sober._) (_No hands are shaken. Starkweather barely acknowledges
Hubbard's greeting._)
{Starkweather}
Tom, I want to see you.
(_Hubbard takes his cue, and proceeds across to tea-table._)
(_Enter Servant. Connie directs him to remove broken cup and
saucer. While this is being done, Starkweather remains silent.
He consults note-book, and Chalmers stands, not quite at ease,
waiting the other's will. At the same time, patter at tea-table.
Hubbard, greeting others and accepting or declining cup of tea._)
(_Servant makes exit_).
{Starkweather}
(_Closing finger on book and looking sharply at Chalmers._) Tom,
this affair of yours in New York must come to an end. Understand?
{Chalmers}
(_Starting._) Hubbard has been talking.
{Starkweather}
No, it is not Hubbard. I have the reports from other sources.
{Chalmers}
It is a harmless affair.
{Starkweather}
I happen to know better. I have the whole record. If you wish,
I can give you every detail, every meeting. I know. There is no
discussion whatever. I want no more of it.
{Chalmers}
I never dreamed for a moment that I was--er--indiscreet.
{Starkweather}
Never forget that every indiscretion of a man in your position is
indiscreet. We have a duty, a great and solemn duty to perform.
Upon our shoulders rest the destinies of ninety million people.
If we fail in our duty, they go down to destruction. Ignorant
demagogues are working on the beast-passions of the people.
If they have their way, they are lost, the country is lost,
civilization is lost. We want no more Dark Ages.
{Chalmers}
Really, I never thought it was as serious as all that.
{Starkweather}
(_Shrugging shoulders and lifting eyebrows._) After all, why should
you? You are only a cog in the machine. I, and the several men
grouped with me, am the machine. You are a useful cog--too useful
to lose--
