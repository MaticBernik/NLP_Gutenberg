SITKA CHARLEY
Um. Sure.
FREDA
_(Preparing to start toward door at right.)_
Start the dogs right away with a man you can trust. And he must
be sure to let Flossie think that Vanderlip sent him. At the best,
Flossie can't arrive until late to-night. And there may be delays. You
keep on Vanderlip's trail so that you will know always where he is.
_(Freda and Sitka Charley start to walk toward the door at right.)_
When I send for him you must bring him to me, and I'll hold him till
Flossie gets in.
SITKA CHARLEY
_(Touching Freda's arm.)_
No very strong, Freda.
FREDA
_(Tapping her forehead.)_
Vanderlip no very strong, Charley.
_(Both cover ears, pull on mittens, and go out.)_
_(Dave Harney, unobserved, has been squatting on hams in front of
counter to right, intently reading newspaper. He is making dumb show
of excited interest. One of the miners discovers him, runs over to
him, and starts to read newspaper over his shoulder. Dave Harney folds
newspaper across, resting it on his knee, and looks up coolly into
face of Miner.)_
MINER
_(In hurt voice.)_
Can't you give a fellow a squint at your paper?
DAVE HARNEY
Got any sugar?
Sure.
MINER
DAVE HARNEY
Give me a whack at your sugar barrel?
MINER
_(Surprised and shocked.)_
No.
DAVE HARNEY
Then nary squint at my noospaper.
_(In meantime other miners and clerks have surrounded him, all
demanding to see his newspaper. Whereupon he puts paper in his pocket,
rises to his feet, and starts toward door to right, miners and clerks
following him and grumbling at his meanness.)_
DAVE HARNEY
_(Pausing with his hand on door.)_
You think you're smart, don't you? Got a corner on sugar, eh? And poor
Dave Harney left without no sweetenin' for his coffee an' mush. Well,
poor Dave Harney's got a corner on noos. When you want noos, come an'
see him, an' be sure an bring your sugar along.
_(Goes out, followed by miners.)_
_(Mrs. Eppingwell and Capt. Eppingwell come forward to stove and warm
their hands.)_
CAPT. EPPINGWELL
_(Continuing conversation.)_
Perhaps Freda doesn't know about Flossie. I always thought her a good
girl at heart.
MRS. EPPINGWELL
Why this haste then? Why are they running away to-night instead of
to-morrow as they had planned? They must have received information
somehow, even before the mail carrier arrived. _(Enter Mail Carrier
from left.)_
And look how she captured the mail carrier at once, and for one thing,
I know, to learn Flossie's whereabouts.
CAPT. EPPINGWELL
Here he is now. Let's ask him.
_(Beckons Mail Carrier over to him.)_
You were talking with Freda a little while ago. What did she want to
learn?
MAIL CARRIER
_(Pausing only long enough to reply, and then going on to make exit to
right.)_ Same thing as your wife--where I passed that girl's outfit.
MRS. EPPINGWELL
_(Quietly.)_
I knew it.
CAPT. EPPINGWELL
But why couldn't I go around, or you, and talk with Freda, explain the
situation fully to her, and make an appeal to whatever good is in her?
