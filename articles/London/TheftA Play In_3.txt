Now you're quoting somebody---- father, I suppose. To think of
him being so abused--poor, dear Ali Baba--
{Starkweather}
(_Clearing his throat in advertisement of his presence._) A-hem.
(_Margaret and Connie turn around abruptly and discover him._)
{Margaret}
And Connie Father!
(_Both come forward to greet him, Margaret leading._)
{Starkweather}
(_Anticipating, showing the deliberate method of the busy man
saving time by eliminating the superfluous._) Fine, thank you.
Quite well in every particular. This Ali Baba? Who is Ali Baba?
(_Margaret looks amused reproach at Connie._)
{Connie}
Mr. Howard Knox.
{Starkweather}
And why is he called Ali Baba?
{Margaret}
That is my nickname for him. In the den of thieves, you know. You
remember your Arabian Nights.
{Starkweather}
(_Severely._) I have been wanting to speak to you for some time,
Margaret, about that man. You know that I have never interfered
with your way of life since your marriage, nor with your and
Tom's housekeeping arrangements. But this man Knox. I understand
that you have even had him here in your house--
{Margaret}
(_Interrupting._) He is very liable to be here this afternoon, any
time, now.
(_Connie displays irritation at Margaret._)
{Starkweather}
(_Continuing imperturbably._) _Your_ house--_you_, my daughter, and
the wife of Senator Chalmers. As I said, I have not interfered
with you since your marriage. But this Knox affair transcends
household arrangements. It is of political importance. The man is
an enemy to our class, a firebrand. Why do you have him here?
{Margaret}
Because I like him. Because he is a man I am proud to call
"friend." Because I wish there were more men like him, many
more men like him, in the world. Because I have ever seen in him
nothing but the best and highest. And, besides, it's such good
fun to see how one virtuous man can so disconcert you captains of
industry and arbiters of destiny. Confess that you are very
much disconcerted, father, right now. He will be here in a few
minutes, and you will be more disconcerted. Why? Because it is
an affair that transcends family arrangements. And it is your
affair, not mine.
{Starkweather}
This man Knox is a dangerous character--one that I am not pleased
to see any of my family take up with. He is not a gentleman.
{Margaret}
He is a self-made man, if that is what you mean, and he certainly
hasn't any money.
{Connie}
(_Interrupting._) He says that money is theft--at least when it is
in the hands of a wealthy person.
{Starkweather}
He is uncouth--ignorant.
{Margaret}
I happen to know that he is a graduate of the University of
Oregon.
{Starkweather}
(_Sneeringly._) A cow college. But that is not what I mean. He is a
demagogue, stirring up the wild-beast passions of the people.
{Margaret}
Surely you would not call his advocacy of that child labor bill
and of the conservation of the forest and coal lands stirring up
the wild-beast passions of the people?
{Starkweather}
(_Wearily._) You don't understand. When I say he is dangerous it is
because he threatens all the stabilities, because he threatens
us who have made this country and upon whom this country and its
prosperity rest.
