And I suppose Seth was busy running the engine, Mrs. Jones observed.
I was breaking him in, wasnt I?  Mr. Jones protested.  So we made the
run into Amato.  Shed never opened her mouth once, and no soonerd the
engine stopped than shed jumped to the ground and was gone.  Just like
that.  Not a thank you kindly.  Nothing.
But next morning when we came to pull out for Quito with a dozen flat
cars loaded with rails, there she was in the cab waiting for us; and in
the daylight I could see how much better a looker she was than the night
before.
Huh! shes adopted you, Seth grins.  And it looked like it.  She just
stood there and looked at meat uslike a loving hound dog that you love,
that youve caught with a string of sausages inside of him, and that just
knows you aint going to lift a hand to him.  Go chase yourself! I told
her _pronto_.  (Mrs. Jones her proximity noticeable with a wince at the
Spanish word.)  You see, Sarah, Id no use for her, even at the start.
Mrs. Jones stiffened.  Her lips moved soundlessly, but I knew to what
syllables.
And what made it hardest was Seth jeering at me.  You cant shake her
that way, he said.  You saved her life  I didnt, I said sharply;
it was you.  But she thinks you did, which is the same thing, he came
back at me.  And now she belongs to you.  Custom of the country, as you
ought to know.
Heathenish, said Mrs. Jones, and though her steady gaze was set upon
the Tower of Jewels I knew she was making no reference to its
architecture.
Shes come to do light housekeeping for you, Seth grinned.  I let him
rave, though afterwards I kept him throwing in the coal too fast to work
his mouth very much.  Why, say, when I got to the spot where I picked her
up, and stopped the train for her to get off, she just flopped down on
her knees, got a hammerlock with her arms around my knees, and cried all
over my shoes.  What was I to do?
With no perceptible movement that I was aware of, Mrs. Jones advertised
her certitude of knowledge of what _she_ would have done.
And the moment we pulled into Quito, she did what shed done
beforevanished.  Sarah never believes me when I say how relieved I felt
to be quit of her.  But it was not to be.  I got to my dobe house and
managed a cracking fine dinner my cook had ready for me.  She was mostly
Spiggoty and half Indian, and her name was Paloma.Now, Sarah, havent I
told you she was oldern a grandmother, and looked more like a buzzard
than a dove?  Why, I couldnt bear to eat with her around where I could
look at her.  But she did make things comfortable, and she was some
economical when it came to marketing.
