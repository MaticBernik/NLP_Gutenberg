No sugar, you can't do business with me.
_(Rushes through door, slamming it after him.)_
_(General laugh from miners about stove. Clerk throws up his arms
despairingly.)_
_(Vanderlip looks backward through door, which he pulls open for a
moment, and laughs at Dave Harney.)_
_(Loraine Lisznayi enters from right and pauses at door to brush snow
from moccasins.)_
VANDERLIP
_(Sees Loraine Lisznayi, starts across to meet her, but stops midway
to speak hurriedly to Sitka Charley.)_
How about those dogs, Charley?
SITKA CHARLEY
I get um all right by and by.
VANDERLIP
I want them right away, to-day.
SITKA CHARLEY
Yesterday you tell me to-morrow.
VANDERLIP
To-day, I tell you to-day. Never mind the price. I must have
them--good dogs. Tonight, twelve o'clock, have them down at the
water-hole all ready, harnesses, grub, everything in shape. And you're
to drive them down river for me. Sure?
SITKA CHARLEY
Sure.
VANDERLIP
_(Over his shoulder as he continues to cross to right.)_
Never mind the price. I must have them.
_(Crosses on over to right to Loraine Lisznayi, an expression of joy
on his face. Sweeps off his Fur cap and shakes her hand.)_
LORAINE
You must do better than that. Had there been a woman here, your face
would have given everything away.
VANDERLIP
I can't help the gladness getting into my face, Loraine.
LORAINE
Don't call me Loraine. Somebody might hear. And we can't be too
careful. And you mustn't talk but for a moment, Floyd.
VANDERLIP
_(Grinning broadly.)_
There you go, calling me Floyd. Somebody might hear. But who's afraid?
I'm not. Let 'em hear. I'm glad of it! Proud of it that you're mine.
The dearest little woman in the world, and mine, all mine!
LORAINE
_(Glancing furtively about and finding that nobody is paying any
attention.)_
Hush, dear. Wait until we are safely away, and then I shall be proud
before all the world to have you proud of me. You are such a man! Such
a man!
VANDERLIP
Just wait until I get you into that Mediterranean palace. We'll make
'em sit up with this Klondike gold of ours. People don't know how rich
I am, Loraine. Nor do you. I've got pay-claims over on Dominion Creek
nobody dreams of, and--
LORAINE
I don't care how much you've got, or how little. It's you, you big,
big man, you, my hero, that I care for. You'll grace a palace like a
prince, and I've known a few princes, too.
VANDERLIP
And queens, too, didn't you say?
LORAINE
Yes, and queens, too. And they will be proud and glad to know you.
They don't have men like you over there--real men. You'll create a
sensation.
VANDERLIP
_(Anxiously.)_
But this living in palaces--sort of softening and fattening, ain't it?
I don't like fat.
_(Looks her over critically.)_
You don't incline that way, do you?
LORAINE
_(Laughing.)_
You foolish, dear man, of course not. Do I look it?
VANDERLIP
_(Slowly.)_
Well, you look round--and plump.
LORAINE
I've always been plump like this. I'm like my mother. She was that
way. She never got stout, and neither shall I.
