(_Dowsett and Mrs. Dowsett make exit._)
(_The instant Mrs. Dowsett's remark puts a complete end to Mrs.
Starkweather's speech, Starkweather, without answer or noticing
his wife, turns and interrogates Servant with a glance._)
{Servant}
Mr. Dobleman has already left some time to come here, sir.
{Starkweather}
Show him in as soon as he comes.
{Servant}
Yes, sir.
(_Servant makes exit._)
(_Margaret, Dolores Ortega, and Rutland are left in a group
together, this time around tea-table, where Margaret serves
Rutland another cup of tea. From time to time Margaret glances
curiously at the serious group of men across the stage._)
(_Starkweather is thinking hard with knitted brows. Hubbard is
likewise pondering._)
{Chalmers}
If I were certain Knox had those papers I would take him by the
throat and shake them out of him.
{Starkweather}
No foolish talk like that, Tom. This is a serious matter.
{Hubbard}
But Knox has no money. A Starkweather stenographer comes high.
{Starkweather}
There is more than Knox behind this. (_Enter Dobleman, walking
quickly and in a state of controlled excitement._)
{Dobleman}
(_To Starkweather._) You received that telegram, sir?
(_Starkweather nods._) I got the New York office--Martinaw--right
along afterward, by long distance. I thought best to follow and
tell you.
{Starkweather}
What did Martinaw say?
{Dobleman}
The files seem in perfect order.
{Starkweather}
Thank God!
(_During the following speech of Dobleman, Rutland says good-bye
to Margaret and Dolores Ortega and makes exit._)
(_Margaret and Dolores Ortega rise a minute afterward and
go toward exit, throwing curious glances at the men but not
disturbing them._)
(_Dolores Ortega makes exit._)
(_Margaret pauses in doorway a moment, giving a final anxious
glance at the men, and makes exit._)
{Dobleman}
But they are not. The stenographer, Miss Standish, has confessed.
For a long time she has followed the practice of taking two or
three letters and documents at a time away from the office. Many
have been photographed and returned. But the more important ones
were retained and clever copies returned. Martinaw says that Miss
Standish herself does not know and cannot tell which of the ones
she returned are genuine and which are copies.
{Hubbard}
Knox never did this.
{Starkweather}
Did Martinaw say whom Miss Standish was acting for?
{Dobleman}
Gherst.
(_The alarm on the three men's faces is patent._)
{Starkweather}
Gherst!
(_Pauses to think._)
{Hubbard}
Then it is not so grave after all. A yellow journal sensation is
the best Gherst can make of it. And, documents or not, the very
medium by which it is made public discredits it.
{Starkweather}
Trust Gherst for more ability than that. He will certainly
exploit them in his newspapers, but not until after Knox has
used them in his speech. Oh, the cunning dog! Never could he
have chosen a better mode and moment to strike at me, at the
Administration, at everything. That is Gherst all over. Playing
to the gallery. Inducing Knox to make this spectacular exposure
on the floor of the House just at the critical time when so many
important bills are pending.
