Impossible!
_(Looks at his watch and smiles triumphantly.)_
I knew it. On time to the tick of the second.
MRS. EPPINGWELL
_(Smiling.)_
Not by Dawson time.
CAPT. EPPINGWELL
Oh! of course. I haven't changed my watch. I'm still going by
sun-time. Sorry.
MRS. EPPINGWELL
_(Smiling.)_
I forgive you. It is the first time, but I really can't count it
against you.
CAPT. EPPINGWELL
_(Looking closely into her face.)_
What's wrong?
MRS. EPPINGWELL
Archie, you're the dearest man I know. Of course there is something
wrong, and of course you knew it as soon as you set eyes on me. Well,
I am beaten.
CAPT. EPPINGWELL
The Ever-Victorious-One beaten! Impossible! I'll not believe it.
MRS. EPPINGWELL
I am, just the same. Here I have been trying to save Floyd Vanderlip,
counteracting that evil woman's influence, having him to tea and
dinner and giving him no end of my time, and Flossie isn't here yet,
and he runs away with Freda Mo-loof to-night. It's all arranged, and
everything.
CAPT. EPPINGWELL
But--but--wait a minute. Enlighten me. I am only a poor traveller.
Who is this Flossie? And why shouldn't this Vanderlip-man--whoever he
is--run away if he wants to?
MRS. EPPINGWELL
How ridiculous of me! I forget you've been away. You know who Freda
Moloof is?
CAPT. EPPINGWELL
Surely, surely. She has the most magnificent furs and the
most magnificent dogs in all Alaska. A fascinating creature,
I--er--understand. She plays with men as a child plays with bubbles.
MRS. EPPINGWELL
It seems to me I've heard that before.
CAPT. EPPINGWELL
It has become a saying in the country.
MRS. EPPINGWELL
I have heard of men who whistle women up as they would whistle dogs.
She must be the type of woman that whistles men.
CAPT. EPPINGWELL
_(Warmly.)_
All she has to do is look at a man.
MRS. EPPINGWELL
_(Smiling.)_
You speak as though she had looked at you.
CAPT. EPPINGWELL
_(Smiling.)_
A very interesting woman.
MRS. EPPINGWELL
Well, anyway, she has cast eyes and wiles upon Floyd Vanderlip.
CAPT. EPPINGWELL
But why shouldn't she? This is a free country.
MRS. EPPINGWELL
Wait a minute. I'm trying to explain. Floyd Vanderlip is engaged to
marry some one else.
CAPT. EPPINGWELL
O-o-h!
MRS. EPPINGWELL
Floyd Vanderlip is a big, strong man. For five years he chased
Eldorados over the ice-fields, living on moose and salmon and working
like a beast. He never had an idle moment in which to be wicked. Then
he struck it on Klondike and is worth millions and millions. Also, he
sat down for the first time in five years and rested.
He remembered a girl who was waiting for him down in the States--a
young thing--and sent for her to come in. They were to be married as
soon as she arrived. He has a cabin all ready. Well, that's Flossie.
She is coming in over the ice now--he's told me all about it--and
ought to be here any day. I've been looking for her, and looking for
her, till I am almost sick. Then this Freda Moloof cast her spell upon
him. I heard the gossip--
