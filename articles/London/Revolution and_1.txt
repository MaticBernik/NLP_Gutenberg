According to the same authority, under the best conditions for
organization in farming, labour can produce 20 bushels of wheat for 66
cents, or 1 bushel for 3.5 cents.  This was done on a bonanza farm of
10,000 acres in California, and was the average cost of the whole product
of the farm.  Mr. Carroll D. Wright says that to-day 4,500,000 men, aided
by machinery, turn out a product that would require the labour of
40,000,000 men if produced by hand.  Professor Herzog, of Austria, says
that 5,000,000 people with the machinery of to-day, employed at socially
useful labour, would be able to supply a population of 20,000,000 people
with all the necessaries and small luxuries of life by working 1.5 hours
per day.
This being so, matter being mastered, man's efficiency for food- and
shelter-getting being increased a thousandfold over the efficiency of the
caveman, then why is it that millions of modern men live more miserably
than lived the caveman?  This is the question the revolutionist asks, and
he asks it of the managing class, the capitalist class.  The capitalist
class does not answer it.  The capitalist class cannot answer it.
If modern man's food- and shelter-getting efficiency is a thousandfold
greater than that of the caveman, why, then, are there 10,000,000 people
in the United States to-day who are not properly sheltered and properly
fed?  If the child of the caveman did not have to work, why, then,
to-day, in the United States, are 80,000 children working out their lives
in the textile factories alone?  If the child of the caveman did not have
to work, why, then, to-day, in the United States, are there 1,752,187
child-labourers?
It is a true count in the indictment.  The capitalist class has
mismanaged, is to-day mismanaging.  In New York City 50,000 children go
hungry to school, and in New York City there are 1,320 millionaires.  The
point, however, is not that the mass of mankind is miserable because of
the wealth the capitalist class has taken to itself.  Far from it.  The
point really is that the mass of mankind is miserable, not for want of
the wealth taken by the capitalist class, _but for want of the wealth
that was never created_.  This wealth was never created because the
capitalist class managed too wastefully and irrationally.  The capitalist
class, blind and greedy, grasping madly, has not only not made the best
of its management, but made the worst of it.  It is a management
prodigiously wasteful.  This point cannot be emphasized too strongly.
In face of the facts that modern man lives more wretchedly than the
caveman, and that modern man's food- and shelter-getting efficiency is a
thousandfold greater than the caveman's, no other solution is possible
than that the management is prodigiously wasteful.
