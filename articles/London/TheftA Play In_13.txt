{Dowsett}
Exactly so. Exactly.
{Sakari}
The less you sell, the harder are the times?
{Dowsett}
Just so.
{Sakari}
Then if the people are thrifty, and buy less, times will be
harder?
{Dowsett}
(_Perplexed._) Er--it would seem so.
{Sakari}
Then it would seem that the present bad times are due to the fact
that the people are thrifty, rather than not thrifty?
(_Dowsett is nonplussed, and Mrs. Dowsett throws up her hands in
despair._)
{Mrs. Dowsett}
(_Turning to Knox._) Perhaps you can explain to us, Mr. Knox, the
reason for this terrible condition of affairs.
(_Starkweather closes note-book on finger and listens._) (_Knox
smiles, but does not speak._)
{Dolores Ortega}
Please do, Mr. Knox. I am so dreadfully anxious to know why
living is so high now. Only this morning I understand meat went
up again.
(_Knox hesitates and looks questioningly at Margaret._)
{Hubbard}
I am sure Mr. Knox can shed new light on this perplexing problem.
{Chalmers}
Surely you, the whirlwind of oratorical swords in the House, are
not timid here--among friends.
{Knox} (_Sparring._) I had no idea that questions of such nature
were topics of conversation at affairs like this.
{Starkweather}
(_Abruptly and imperatively._) What causes the high prices?
{Knox}
(_Equally abrupt and just as positive as the other was
imperative._) _Theft_!
(_It is a sort of a bombshell he has exploded, but they receive it
politely and smilingly, even though it has shaken them up._)
{Dolores Ortega}
What a romantic explanation. I suppose everybody who has anything
has stolen it.
{Knox}
Not quite, but almost quite. Take motorcars, for example. This
year five hundred million dollars has been spent for motor-cars.
It required men toiling in the mines and foundries, women sewing
their eyes out in sweat-shops, shop girls slaving for four and
five dollars a week, little children working in the factories and
cotton-mills--all these it required to produce those five hundred
millions spent this year in motor-cars. And all this has been
stolen from those who did the work.
{Mrs. Starkweather}
I always knew those motor-cars were to blame for terrible things.
{Dolores Ortega}
But Mr. Knox, I have a motor-car.
{Knox}
Somebody's labor made that car. Was it yours?
{Dolores Ortega}
Mercy, no! I bought it---- and paid for it.
{Knox}
Then did you labor at producing something else, and exchange the
fruits of that labor for the motor-car?
(_A pause._)
You do not answer. Then I am to understand that you have a
motor-car which was made by somebody else's labor and for which
you gave no labor of your own. This I call theft. You call it
property. Yet it is theft.
{Starkweather}
(_Interrupting Dolores Ortega who was just about to speak._)
But surely you have intelligence to see the question in larger
ways than stolen motor-cars. I am a man of affairs. I don't steal
motor-cars.
{Knox}
(_Smiling._) Not concrete little motor-cars, no. You do things on a
large scale.
{Starkweather}
Steal?
{Knox}
(_Shrugging his shoulders._) If you will have it so.
