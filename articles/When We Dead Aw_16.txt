MAIA.
[Smiles scornfully.] Only draw away from each other a little, you mean?
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Shakes his head.] Even that is not necessary.
MAIA.
Well then? Come out with what you want to do with me.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[With some hesitation.] What I now feel so keenly--and so
painfully--that I require, is to have some one about me who really and
truly stands close to me--
MAIA.
[Interrupts him anxiously.] Don't I do that, Rubek?
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Waving her aside.] Not in that sense. What I need is the companionship
of another person who can, as it were, complete me--supply what is
wanting in me--be one with me in all my striving.
MAIA.
[Slowly.] It's true that things like that are a great deal too hard for
me.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Oh no, they are not at all in your line, Maia.
MAIA.
[With an outburst.] And heaven knows I don't want them to be, either!
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
I know that very well.--And it was with no idea of finding any such help
in my life-work that I married you.
MAIA.
[Observing him closely.] I can see in your face that you are thinking of
some one else.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Indeed? I have never noticed before that you were a thought-reader. But
you can see that, can you?
MAIA.
Yes, I can. Oh, I know you so well, so well, Rubek.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Then perhaps you can also see who it is I am thinking of?
MAIA.
Yes, indeed I can.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Well? Have the goodness to--?
MAIA.
You are thinking of that--that model you once used for-- [Suddenly
letting slip the train of thought.] Do you know, the people down at the
hotel think she's mad.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Indeed? And pray what do the people down at the hotel think of you and
the bear-killer?
MAIA.
That has nothing to do with the matter. [Continuing the former train of
thought.] But it was this pale lady you were thinking of.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Calmly.] Precisely, of her.--When I had no more use for her--and when,
besides, she went away from me--vanished without a word--
MAIA.
Then you accepted me as a sort of makeshift, I suppose?
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[More unfeelingly.] Something of the sort, to tell the truth, little
Maia. For a year or a year and a half I had lived there lonely and
brooding, and had put the last touch--the very last touch, to my work.
"The Resurrection Day" went out over the world and brought me fame--and
everything else that heart could desire. [With greater warmth.] But I no
longer loved my own work. Men's laurels and incense nauseated me, till I
could have rushed away in despair and hidden myself in the depths of the
woods. [Looking at her.] You, who are a thought-reader--can you guess
what then occurred to me?
MAIA.
[Lightly.] Yes, it occurred to you to make portrait-busts of gentlemen
and ladies.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Nods.] To order, yes. With animals' faces behind the masks. Those I
threw in gratis--into the bargain, you understand. [Smiling.] But that
was not precisely what I had in my mind.
