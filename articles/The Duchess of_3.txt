MAFFIO
   May it please your Grace,
   The wives of Padua are above suspicion.
DUKE
   What, are they so ill-favoured!  Let us go,
   This Cardinal detains our pious Duchess;
   His sermon and his beard want cutting both:
   Will you come with us, sir, and hear a text
   From holy Jerome?
MORANZONE [_bowing_]
   My liege, there are some matters
DUKE [_interrupting_]
   Thou needst make no excuse for missing mass.
   Come, gentlemen.
                                   [_Exit with his suite into Cathedral_.]
GUIDO [_after a pause_]
   So the Duke sold my father;
   I kissed his hand.
MORANZONE
   Thou shalt do that many times.
GUIDO
   Must it be so?
MORANZONE
   Ay! thou hast sworn an oath.
GUIDO
   That oath shall make me marble.
MORANZONE
   Farewell, boy,
   Thou wilt not see me till the time is ripe.
GUIDO
   I pray thou comest quickly.
MORANZONE
   I will come
   When it is time; be ready.
GUIDO
   Fear me not.
MORANZONE
   Here is your friend; see that you banish him
   Both from your heart and Padua.
GUIDO
   From Padua,
   Not from my heart.
MORANZONE
   Nay, from thy heart as well,
   I will not leave thee till I see thee do it.
GUIDO
   Can I have no friend?
MORANZONE
   Revenge shall be thy friend;
   Thou needst no other.
GUIDO
   Well, then be it so.
                                             [_Enter_ ASCANIO CRISTOFANO.]
ASCANIO
   Come, Guido, I have been beforehand with you in everything, for I have
   drunk a flagon of wine, eaten a pasty, and kissed the maid who served
   it.  Why, you look as melancholy as a schoolboy who cannot buy apples,
   or a politician who cannot sell his vote.  What news, Guido, what
   news?
GUIDO
   Why, that we two must part, Ascanio.
ASCANIO
   That would be news indeed, but it is not true.
GUIDO
   Too true it is, you must get hence, Ascanio,
   And never look upon my face again.
ASCANIO
   No, no; indeed you do not know me, Guido;
   Tis true I am a common yeomans son,
   Nor versed in fashions of much courtesy;
   But, if you are nobly born, cannot I be
   Your serving man?  I will tend you with more love
   Than any hired servant.
GUIDO [_clasping his hand_]
   Ascanio!
     [_Sees_ MORANZONE _looking at him and drops_ ASCANIOS _hand_.]
   It cannot be.
ASCANIO
   What, is it so with you?
   I thought the friendship of the antique world
   Was not yet dead, but that the Roman type
   Might even in this poor and common age
   Find counterparts of love; then by this love
   Which beats between us like a summer sea,
   Whatever lot has fallen to your hand
   May I not share it?
GUIDO
   Share it?
ASCANIO
   Ay!
GUIDO
   No, no.
ASCANIO
   Have you then come to some inheritance
   Of lordly castle, or of stored-up gold?
GUIDO [_bitterly_]
   Ay! I have come to my inheritance.
   O bloody legacy! and O murderous dole!
   Which, like the thrifty miser, must I hoard,
   And to my own self keep; and so, I pray you,
   Let us part here.
ASCANIO
   What, shall we never more
   Sit hand in hand, as we were wont to sit,
   Over some book of ancient chivalry
   Stealing a truant holiday from school,
   Follow the huntsmen through the autumn woods,
   And watch the falcons burst their tasselled jesses,
   When the hare breaks from covert.
