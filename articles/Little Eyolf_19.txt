RITA. Yes, but before Asta came? You have been away from me all the
morning.
ALLMERS. I have been sitting here looking out over the water.
RITA. Ugh,--how can you?
ALLMERS. [Impatiently.] I like best to be alone now.
RITA. [Moving restlessly about.] And then to sit still! To stay in one
place!
ALLMERS. I have nothing in the world to move for.
RITA. I cannot bear to be anywhere long. Least of all here--with the
fiord at my very feet.
ALLMERS. It is just the nearness of the fiord--
RITA. [To BORGHEIM.] Don't you think he should come back with the rest
of us?
BORGHEIM. [To ALLMERS.] I believe it would be better for you.
ALLMERS. No, no; let me stay where I am.
RITA. Then I will stay with you, Alfred.
ALLMERS. Very well; do so, then. You remain too, Asta.
ASTA. [Whispers to BORGHEIM.] Let us leave them alone!
BORGHEIM. [With a glance of comprehension.] Miss Allmers, shall we go a
little further--along the shore? For the very last time?
ASTA. [Taking her umbrella.] Yes, come. Let us go a little further.
[ASTA and BORGHEIM go out together behind the boat-shed. ALLMERS wanders
about for a little. Then he seats himself on a stone under the trees on
the left.]
RITA. [Comes up and stands before him, her hands folded and hanging
down.] Can you think the thought, Alfred--that we have lost Eyolf?
ALLMERS. [Looking sadly at the ground.] We must accustom ourselves to
think it.
RITA. I cannot. I cannot. And then that horrible sight that will haunt
me all my life long.
ALLMERS. [Looking up.] What sight? What have you seen?
RITA. I have seen nothing myself. I have only heard it told. Oh--!
ALLMERS. You may as well tell me at once.
RITA. I got Borgheim to go down with me to the pier--
ALLMERS. What did you want there?
RITA. To question the boys as to how it happened.
ALLMERS. But we know that.
RITA. We got to know more.
ALLMERS. Well?
RITA. It is not true that he disappeared all at once.
ALLMERS. Do they say that now?
RITA. Yes. They say they saw him lying down on the bottom. Deep down in
the clear water.
ALLMERS. [Grinding his teeth.] And they didn't save him!
RITA. I suppose they could not.
ALLMERS. They could swim--every one of them. Did they tell you how he
was lying whilst they could see him?
RITA. Yes. They said he was lying on his back. And with great, open
eyes.
ALLMERS. Open eyes. But quite still?
RITA. Yes, quite still. And then something came and swept him away. They
called it the undertow.
ALLMERS. [Nodding slowly.] So that was the last they saw of him.
RITA. [Suffocated with tears.] Yes.
ALLMERS. [In a dull voice.] And never--never will any one see him again.
RITA. [Wailing.] I shall see him day and night, as he lay down there.
ALLMERS. With great, open eyes.
RITA. [Shuddering.] Yes, with great, open eyes. I see them! I see them
now!
