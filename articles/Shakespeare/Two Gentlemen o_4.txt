ACT II.
SCENE I. _Milan. The DUKE'S Palace._
  _Enter VALENTINE and SPEED._
_Speed._ Sir, your glove.
_Val._                  Not mine; my gloves are on.
_Speed._ Why, then, this may be yours, for this is but one.
_Val._ Ha! let me see: ay, give it me, it's mine:
Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine!
Ah, Silvia, Silvia!                                                  5
_Speed._ Madam Silvia! Madam Silvia!
_Val._ How now, sirrah?
_Speed._ She is not within hearing, sir.
_Val._ Why, sir, who bade you call her?
_Speed._ Your worship, sir; or else I mistook.                      10
_Val._ Well, you'll still be too forward.
_Speed._ And yet I was last chidden for being too slow.
_Val._ Go to, sir: tell me, do you know Madam Silvia?
_Speed._ She that your worship loves?
_Val._ Why, how know you that I am in love?                         15
_Speed._ Marry, by these special marks: first, you have
learned, like Sir Proteus, to wreathe your arms, like a malecontent;
to relish a love-song, like a robin-redbreast; to
walk alone, like one that had the pestilence; to sigh, like a
school-boy that had lost his A B C; to weep, like a young           20
wench that had buried her grandam; to fast, like one that
takes diet; to watch, like one that fears robbing; to speak
puling, like a beggar at Hallowmas. You were wont, when
you laughed, to crow like a cock; when you walked, to walk
like one of the lions; when you fasted, it was presently after      25
dinner; when you looked sadly, it was for want of money:
and now you are metamorphosed with a mistress, that, when
I look on you, I can hardly think you my master.
_Val._ Are all these things perceived in me?
_Speed._ They are all perceived without ye.                         30
_Val._ Without me? they cannot.
_Speed._ Without you? nay, that's certain, for, without
you were so simple, none else would: but you are so without
these follies, that these follies are within you, and shine
through you like the water in an urinal, that not an eye that       35
sees you but is a physician to comment on your malady.
_Val._ But tell me, dost thou know my lady Silvia?
_Speed._ She that you gaze on so as she sits at supper?
_Val._ Hast thou observed that? even she, I mean.
_Speed._ Why, sir, I know her not.                                  40
_Val._ Dost thou know her by my gazing on her, and
yet knowest her not?
_Speed._ Is she not hard-favoured, sir?
_Val._ Not so fair, boy, as well-favoured.
_Speed._ Sir, I know that well enough.                              45
_Val._ What dost thou know?
_Speed._ That she is not so fair as, of you, well favoured.
_Val._ I mean that her beauty is exquisite, but her
favour infinite.
_Speed._ That's because the one is painted, and the other           50
out of all count.
_Val._ How painted? and how out of count?
_Speed._ Marry, sir, so painted, to make her fair, that no
man counts of her beauty.
_Val._ How esteemest thou me? I account of her beauty.              55
