TRIN. This is the tune of our catch, played by the picture of Nobody.
STEPH. If thou beest a man, show thyself in thy likeness: if thou beest
a devil, take't as thou list.
TRIN. O, forgive me my sins!
STEPH. He that dies pays all debts: I defy thee. Mercy upon us!
CAL. Art thou afeard?
STEPH. No, monster, not I.
    CAL. Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises,
    Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not.
    Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments
    Will hum about mine ears; and sometime voices,
    That, if I then had waked after long sleep,
    Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming,
    The clouds methought would open and show riches
    Ready to drop upon me, that, when I waked,
    I cried to dream again.
STEPH. This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I shall have my
music for nothing.
CAL. When Prospero is destroyed.
STEPH. That shall be by and by: I remember the story.
TRIN. The sound is going away; let's follow it, and after do our work.
STEPH. Lead, monster; we'll follow. I would I could see this taborer;
he lays it on.
TRIN. Wilt come? I'll follow, Stephano.
                                                             [_Exeunt._

SCENE III
_Another part of the island._
_Enter_ ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO, ADRIAN, FRANCISCO, _and
others_.
    GON. By'r lakin, I can go no further, sir;
    My old bones ache: here's a maze trod indeed
    Through forth-rights and meanders! By your patience,
    I needs must rest me.
    _Alon._                    Old lord, I cannot blame thee,
    Who am myself attach'd with weariness,
    To the dulling of my spirits: sit down, and rest.
    Even here I will put off my hope and keep it
    No longer for my flatterer: he is drown'd
    Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks
    Our frustrate search on land. Well, let him go.
    ANT. [_aside to_ SEB.]
    I am right glad that he's so out of hope.
    Do not, for one repulse, forego the purpose
    That you resolved to effect.
    SEB. [_aside to_ ANT.]      The next advantage
    Will we take throughly.
    ANT. [_aside to_ SEB.]
                                    Let it be to-night:
    For, now they are oppress'd with travel, they
    Will not, nor cannot, use such vigilance
    As when they are fresh.
    SEB. [_aside to_ ANT.]      I say, to-night: no more.
                                           [_Solemn and strange music._
ALON. What harmony is this? My good friends, hark!
GON. Marvellous sweet music!
    _Enter_ PROSPERO _above, invisible. Enter several strange Shapes,
      bringing in a banquet; they dance about it with gentle actions of
      salutation; and, inviting the King, etc. to eat, they depart._
ALON. Give us kind keepers, heavens! What were these!
    SEB. A living drollery. Now I will believe
    That there are unicorns, that in Arabia
    There is one tree, the phoenix' throne, one phoenix
    At this hour reigning there.
    ANT.                   I'll believe both;
    And what does else want credit, come to me,
    And I'll be sworn 'tis true: travellers ne'er did lie,
    Though fools at home condemn 'em.
