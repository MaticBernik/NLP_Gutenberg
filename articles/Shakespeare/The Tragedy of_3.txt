VIRGILIA.
Give me excuse, good madam; I will obey you in everything
hereafter.
VOLUMNIA.
Let her alone, lady; as she is now, she will but disease our
better mirth.
VALERIA.
In troth, I think she would.--Fare you well, then.--Come,
good sweet lady.--Pr'ythee, Virgilia, turn thy solemness out o'
door and go along with us.
VIRGILIA.
No, at a word, madam; indeed I must not. I wish you much mirth.
VALERIA.
Well then, farewell.
[Exeunt.]
SCENE IV. Before Corioli.
[Enter, with drum and colours, MARCIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, Officers,
and soldiers.]
MARCIUS.
Yonder comes news:--a wager they have met.
LARTIUS.
My horse to yours, no.
MARCIUS.
'Tis done.
LARTIUS.
Agreed.
[Enter a Messenger.]
MARCIUS.
Say, has our general met the enemy?
MESSENGER.
They lie in view; but have not spoke as yet.
LARTIUS.
So, the good horse is mine.
MARCIUS.
I'll buy him of you.
LARTIUS.
No, I'll nor sell nor give him: lend you him I will
For half a hundred years.--Summon the town.
MARCIUS.
How far off lie these armies?
MESSENGER.
Within this mile and half.
MARCIUS.
Then shall we hear their 'larum, and they ours.--
Now, Mars, I pr'ythee, make us quick in work,
That we with smoking swords may march from hence
To help our fielded friends!--Come, blow thy blast.
[They sound a parley. Enter, on the Walls, some Senators and
others.]
Tullus Aufidius, is he within your walls?
FIRST SENATOR.
No, nor a man that fears you less than he,
That's lesser than a little.
[Drum afar off]
Hark, our drums
Are bringing forth our youth! we'll break our walls
Rather than they shall pound us up: our gates,
Which yet seem shut, we have but pinn'd with rushes;
They'll open of themselves.
[Alarum far off.]
Hark you far off!
There is Aufidius; list what work he makes
Amongst your cloven army.
MARCIUS.
O, they are at it!
LARTIUS.
Their noise be our instruction.--Ladders, ho!
[The Volsces enter and pass over.]
MARCIUS.
They fear us not, but issue forth their city.
Now put your shields before your hearts, and fight
With hearts more proof than shields.--Advance, brave Titus:
They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts,
Which makes me sweat with wrath.--Come on, my fellows:
He that retires, I'll take him for a Volsce,
And he shall feel mine edge.
[Alarums, and exeunt Romeans and Volsces fighting. Romans are
beaten back to their trenches. Re-enter MARCIUS.]
MARCIUS.
All the contagion of the south light on you,
You shames of Rome!--you herd of--Boils and plagues
Plaster you o'er, that you may be abhorr'd
Farther than seen, and one infect another
Against the wind a mile! You souls of geese
That bear the shapes of men, how have you run
From slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!
All hurt behind; backs red, and faces pale
With flight and agued fear! Mend, and charge home,
Or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe
And make my wars on you: look to't: come on;
If you'll stand fast we'll beat them to their wives,
As they us to our trenches.
