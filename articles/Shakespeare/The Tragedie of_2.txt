_Hora._ A moth it is to trouble the mindes eye:
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
A little ere the mightiest _Iulius_ fell
The graues stood tennatlesse, and the sheeted dead
Did squeake and gibber in the Roman streets[7]
As starres with traines of fier, and dewes of blood
Disasters in the sunne; and the moist starre,
Vpon whose influence _Neptunes_ Empier stands
Was sicke almost to doomesday with eclipse.
And euen the like precurse of feare euents
As harbindgers preceading still the fates
And prologue to the _Omen_ comming on
Haue heauen and earth together demonstrated
Vnto our Climatures and countrymen.[8]
               _Enter Ghost_.]
[Footnote 1: French designe.]
[Footnote 2: _not proved_ or _tried. Improvement_, as we use the word,
is the result of proof or trial: _upon-proof-ment_.]
[Footnote 3: Is _shark'd_ related to the German _scharren_? _Zusammen
scharren--to scrape together._ The Anglo-Saxon _searwian_ is _to
prepare, entrap, take_.]
[Footnote 4: Some enterprise of acquisition; one for the sake of getting
something.]
[Footnote 5: In Scotch, _remish_--the noise of confused and varied
movements; a _row_; a _rampage_.--Associated with French _remuage_?]
[Footnote 6: _suit_: so used in Scotland still, I think.]
[Footnote 7: _Julius Caesar_, act i. sc. 3, and act ii. sc. 2.]
[Footnote 8: The only suggestion I dare make for the rectifying of the
confusion of this speech is, that, if the eleventh line were inserted
between the fifth and sixth, there would be sense, and very nearly
grammar.
                              and the sheeted dead
    Did squeake and gibber in the Roman streets,
    As harbindgers preceading still the fates;
    As starres with traines of fier, and dewes of blood
(Here understand _precede_)
    Disasters in the sunne;
The tenth will close with the twelfth line well enough.
But no one, any more than myself, will be _satisfied_ with the
suggestion. The probability is, of course, that a line has dropped out
between the fifth and sixth. Anything like this would restore the
connection:
_The labouring heavens themselves teemed dire portent_
As starres &c.]

If thou hast any sound, or vse of Voyce,[3]
Speake to me. If there be any good thing to be done,
That may to thee do ease, and grace to me; speak to me.
If thou art priuy to thy Countries Fate
(Which happily foreknowing may auoyd) Oh speake.
Or, if thou hast vp-hoorded in thy life
Extorted Treasure in the wombe of Earth,

_Mar_. Shall I strike at it with my Partizan? [Sidenote: strike it with]
_Hor_. Do, if it will not stand.
_Barn_. 'Tis heere.
_Hor_. 'Tis heere.

We do it wrong, being so Maiesticall[6]
To offer it the shew of Violence,
For it is as the Ayre, invulnerable,
And our vaine blowes, malicious Mockery.
_Barn_. It was about to speake, when the Cocke crew.
