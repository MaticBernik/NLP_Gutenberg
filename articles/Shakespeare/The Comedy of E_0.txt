_Ant. S._ Stop in your wind, sir: tell me this, I pray:
Where have you left the money that I gave you?
_Dro. E._ O,--sixpence, that I had o' Wednesday last                55
To pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper?
The saddler had it, sir; I kept it not.
_Ant. S._ I am not in a sportive humour now:
Tell me, and dally not, where is the money?
We being strangers here, how darest thou trust                      60
So great a charge from thine own custody?
_Dro. E._ I pray you, jest, sir, as you sit at dinner:
I from my mistress come to you in post;
If I return, I shall be post indeed,
For she will score your fault upon my pate.                         65
Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,
And strike you home without a messenger.
_Ant. S._ Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season;
Reserve them till a merrier hour than this.
Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?                         70
_Dro. E._ To me, sir? why, you gave no gold to me.
_Ant. S._ Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,
And tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge.
_Dro. E._ My charge was but to fetch you from the mart
Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner:                    75
My mistress and her sister stays for you.
_Ant. S._ Now, as I am a Christian, answer me,
In what safe place you have bestow'd my money;
Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours,
That stands on tricks when I am undisposed:                         80
Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?
_Dro. E._ I have some marks of yours upon my pate,
Some of my mistress' marks upon my shoulders;
But not a thousand marks between you both.
If I should pay your worship those again,                           85
Perchance you will not bear them patiently.
_Ant. S._ Thy mistress' marks? what mistress, slave, hast thou?
_Dro. E._ Your worship's wife, my mistress at the Phoenix;
She that doth fast till you come home to dinner,
And prays that you will hie you home to dinner.                     90
_Ant. S._ What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,
Being forbid? There, take you that, sir knave.
_Dro. E._ What mean you, sir? for God's sake, hold your hands!
Nay, an you will not, sir, I'll take my heels.    [_Exit._
_Ant. S._ Upon my life, by some device or other                     95
The villain is o'er-raught of all my money.
They say this town is full of cozenage;
As, nimble jugglers that deceive the eye,
Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind.
Soul-killing witches that deform the body,                         100
Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks,
And many such-like liberties of sin:
If it prove so, I will be gone the sooner.
I'll to the Centaur, to go seek this slave:
I greatly fear my money is not safe.    [_Exit._                   105
