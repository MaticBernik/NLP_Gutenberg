[Enter La Pucelle, on the top, thrusting out
a torch burning.]
PUCELLE.
Behold, this is the happy wedding torch
That joineth Rouen unto her countrymen,
But burning fatal to the Talbotites!
[Exit.]
BASTARD.
See, noble Charles, the beacon of our friend;
The burning torch in yonder turret stands.
CHARLES.
Now shine it like a comet of revenge,
A prophet to the fall of all our foes!
REIGNIER.
Defer no time, delays have dangerous ends;
Enter, and cry, 'The Dauphin!' presently,
And then do execution on the watch.
[Alarum. Exeunt.]
[An alarum. Enter Talbot in an excursion.]
TALBOT.
France, thou shalt rue this treason with thy tears,
If Talbot but survive thy treachery.
Pucelle, that witch, that damned sorceress,
Hath wrought this hellish mischief unawares,
That hardly we escaped the pride of France.
[Exit.]
[An alarum:  excursions.]
[Bedford, brought in sick in a chair. Enter Talbot and Burgundy
without: within La Pucelle, Charles, Bastard, Alencon, and
Reignier, on the walls.]
PUCELLE.
Good morrow, gallants! want ye corn for bread?
I think the Duke of Burgundy will fast
Before he 'll buy again at such a rate:
'Twas full of darnel:  do you like the taste?
BURGUNDY.
Scoff on, vile fiend and shameless courtezan!
I trust ere long to choke thee with thine own,
And make thee curse the harvest of that corn.
CHARLES.
Your Grace may starve perhaps before that time.
BEDFORD.
O, let no words, but deeds, revenge this treason!
PUCELLE.
What will you do, good graybeard? break a lance,
And run a tilt at death within a chair?
TALBOT.
Foul fiend of France, and hag of all despite,
Encompass'd with thy lustful paramours!
Becomes it thee to taunt his valiant age,
And twit with cowardice a man half dead?
Damsel, I 'll have a bout with you again,
Or else let Talbot perish with this shame.
PUCELLE.
Are ye so hot? yet, Pucelle, hold thy peace;
If Talbot do but thunder, rain will follow.
[The English party whisper together in council. ]
God speed the parliament! who shall be the speaker?
TALBOT.
Dare ye come forth and meet us in the field?
PUCELLE.
Belike your lordship takes us then for fools,
To try if that our own be ours or no.
TALBOT.
I speak not to that railing Hecate,
But unto thee, Alencon, and the rest;
Will ye, like soldiers, come and fight it out?
ALENCON.
Signior, no.
TALBOT.
Signior, hang! base muleters of France!
Like peasant foot-boys do they keep the walls,
And dare not take up arms like gentlemen.
PUCELLE.
Away, captains! let 's get us from the walls;
For Talbot means no goodness by his looks.
God be wi' you, my lord! we came but to tell you
That we are here.
[Exeunt from the walls.]
TALBOT.
And there will we be too, ere it be long,
Or else reproach be Talbot's greatest fame!
Vow, Burgundy, by honor of thy house,
Prick'd on by public wrongs sustain'd in France,
Either to get the town again or die:
And I, as sure as English Henry lives,
And as his father here was conqueror,
As sure as in this late-betrayed town
Great Coeur-de-lion's heart was buried,
So sure I swear to get the town or die.
