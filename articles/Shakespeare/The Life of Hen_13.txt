KING.
Deliver this with modesty to the Queen.
[Exit Gardiner.]
The most convenient place that I can think of
For such receipt of learning is Black-Friars;
There ye shall meet about this weighty business.
My Wolsey, see it furnish'd. O, my lord,
Would it not grieve an able man to leave
So sweet a bedfellow? But, conscience, conscience!
O, 'tis a tender place; and I must leave her.
[Exeunt.]
SCENE III.  An ante-chamber of the Queen's apartments.
[Enter Anne Bullen and an Old Lady.]
ANNE.
Not for that neither. Here's the pang that pinches:
His Highness having liv'd so long with her, and she
So good a lady that no tongue could ever
Pronounce dishonour of her,--by my life,
She never knew harm-doing--O, now, after
So many courses of the sun enthroned,
Still growing in a majesty and pomp, the which
To leave a thousand-fold more bitter than
'Tis sweet at first to acquire,--after this process,
To give her the avaunt, it is a pity
Would move a monster.
OLD LADY.
Hearts of most hard temper
Melt and lament for her.
ANNE.
O, God's will, much better
She ne'er had known pomp!  Though't be temporal,
Yet, if that quarrel, fortune, do divorce
It from the bearer, 'tis a sufferance panging
As soul and body's severing.
OLD LADY.
Alas, poor lady!
She's a stranger now again.
ANNE.
So much the more
Must pity drop upon her. Verily,
I swear, 'tis better to be lowly born
And range with humble livers in content,
Than to be perk'd up in a glist'ring grief,
And wear a golden sorrow.
OLD LADY.
Our content
Is our best having.
ANNE.
By my troth and maidenhead,
I would not be a queen.
OLD LADY.
Beshrew me, I would,
And venture maidenhead for't; and so would you,
For all this spice of your hypocrisy.
You, that have so fair parts of woman on you,
Have too a woman's heart, which ever yet
Affected eminence, wealth, sovereignty;
Which, to say sooth, are blessings; and which gifts,
Saving your mincing, the capacity
Of your soft cheveril conscience would receive,
If you might please to stretch it.
ANNE.
Nay, good troth.
OLD LADY.
Yes, troth and troth. You would not be a queen?
ANNE.
No, not for all the riches under heaven.
OLD LADY.
'Tis strange.  A three-pence bow'd would hire me,
Old as I am, to queen it. But, I pray you,
What think you of a duchess? Have you limbs
To bear that load of title?
ANNE.
No, in truth.
OLD LADY.
Then you are weakly made; pluck off a little.
I would not be a young count in your way,
For more than blushing comes to. If your back
Cannot vouchsafe this burden, 'tis too weak
Ever to get a boy.
ANNE.
How you do talk!
I swear again I would not be a queen
For all the world.
OLD LADY.
In faith, for little England
You'd venture an emballing. I myself
Would for Carnarvonshire, although there long'd
No more to the crown but that. Lo, who comes here?
