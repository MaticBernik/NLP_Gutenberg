    MIR. Beseech you, father.
    PROS. Hence! hang not on my garments.
    MIR. Sir, have pity;
    I'll be his surety.
    PROS.                  Silence! one word more
    Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!
    An advocate for an impostor! hush!
    Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he,
    Having seen but him and Caliban: foolish wench!
    To the most of men this is a Caliban,
    And they to him are angels.
    MIR.                   My affections
    Are then most humble; I have no ambition
    To see a goodlier man.
    PROS.                  Come on; obey:
    Thy nerves are in their infancy again
    And have no vigour in them.
    FER.                   So they are;
    My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.
    My father's loss, the weakness which I feel,
    The wreck of all my friends, nor this man's threats,
    To whom I am subdued, are but light to me,
    Might I but through my prison once a day
    Behold this maid: all corners else o' the earth
    Let liberty make use of; space enough
    Have I in such a prison.
    PROS. [_aside._] It works. [_To_ FER.]
      Come on.
    Thou hast done well, fine Ariel! [_To_ FER.] Follow me.
    [_To_ ARIEL.] Hark what thou else shalt do me.
    MIR.                   Be of comfort;
    My father's of a better nature, sir,
    Than he appears by speech: this is unwonted
    Which now came from him.
    PROS.                  Thou shalt be as free
    As mountain winds: but then exactly do
    All points of my command.
    ARI.                   To the syllable.
    PROS. Come, follow. Speak not for him.  [_Exeunt._

SCENE I
_Another part of the island._
_Enter_ ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO, ADRIAN, FRANCISCO, _and
others_.
    GON. Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,
    So have we all, of joy; for our escape
    Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe
    Is common; every day some sailor's wife,
    The masters of some merchant, and the merchant,
    Have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,
    I mean our preservation, few in millions
    Can speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh
    Our sorrow with our comfort.
ALON. Prithee, peace.
SEB. He receives comfort like cold porridge.
ANT. The visitor will not give him o'er so.
SEB. Look, he's winding up the watch of his wit: by and by it will
strike.
GON. Sir,--
SEB. One: tell.
    GON. When every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd,
    Comes to the entertainer--
SEB. A dollar.
GON. Dolour comes to him, indeed: you have spoken truer than you
purposed.
SEB. You have taken it wiselier that I meant you should.
GON. Therefore, my lord,--
ANT. Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!
ALON. I prithee, spare.
GON. Well, I have done: but yet,--
SEB. He will be talking.
ANT. Which, of he or Adrian, for a good wager, first begins to crow?
SEB. The old cock.
ANT. The cockerel.
SEB. Done. The wager?
ANT. A laughter.
SEB. A match!
ADR. Though this island seem to be desert,--
