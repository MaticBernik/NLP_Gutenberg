TIMON.
So soon as dinner's done, we'll forth again.
My Alcibiades. With me? what is your will?
CAPHIS.
My lord, here is a note of certain dues.
TIMON.
Dues! Whence are you?
CAPHIS.
Of Athens here, my lord.
TIMON.
Go to my steward.
CAPHIS.
Please it your lordship, he hath put me off
To the succession of new days this month:
My master is awak'd by great occasion
To call upon his own; and humbly prays you
That with your other noble parts you'll suit
In giving him his right.
TIMON.
Mine honest friend,
I prithee, but repair to me next morning.
CAPHIS.
Nay, good my lord,--
TIMON.
Contain thyself, good friend.
VARRO'S SERVANT.
One Varro's servant, my good lord,--
ISIDORE'S SERVANT.
From Isidore; he humbly prays your speedy payment.
CAPHIS.
If you did know, my lord, my master's wants,--
VARRO'S SERVANT.
'Twas due on forfeiture, my lord, six weeks and past.
ISIDORE'S SERVANT.
Your steward puts me off, my lord; and
I am sent expressly to your lordship.
TIMON.
Give me breath.
I do beseech you, good my lords, keep on;
I'll wait upon you instantly.
[Exeunt ALCIBIADES and LORDS.]
[To FLAVIUS.]
Come hither: pray you,
How goes the world, that I am thus encounter'd
With clamorous demands of date-broke bonds,
And the detention of long-since-due debts,
Against my honour?
FLAVIUS.
Please you, gentlemen,
The time is unagreeable to this business:
Your importunacy cease till after dinner,
That I may make his lordship understand
Wherefore you are not paid.
TIMON.
Do so, my friends.
See them well entertain'd.
[Exit.]
FLAVIUS.
Pray, draw near.
[Exit.]
[Enter APEMANTUS and FOOL.]
CAPHIS.
Stay, stay; here comes the fool with Apemantus:
Let's ha' some sport with 'em.
VARRO'S SERVANT.
Hang him, he'll abuse us!
ISIDORE'S SERVANT.
A plague upon him, dog!
VARRO'S SERVANT.
How dost, fool?
APEMANTUS.
Dost dialogue with thy shadow?
VARRO'S SERVANT.
I speak not to thee.
APEMANTUS.
No; 'tis to thyself. [To the FOOL.]
Come away.
ISIDORE'S SERVANT. [To VARRO'S SERVANT.]
There's the fool hangs on your back already.
APEMANTUS.
No, thou stand'st single; thou'rt not on him yet.
CAPHIS.
Where's the fool now?
APEMANTUS.
He last asked the question. Poor rogues and usurers'
men! bawds between gold and want!
ALL SERVANTS.
What are we, Apemantus?
APEMANTUS.
Asses.
ALL SERVANTS.
Why?
APEMANTUS.
That you ask me what you are, and do not know yourselves. Speak
to 'em, fool.
FOOL.
How do you, gentlemen?
ALL SERVANTS.
Gramercies, good fool. How does your mistress?
FOOL.
She's e'en setting on water to scald such chickens as you
are. Would we could see you at Corinth!
APEMANTUS.
Good! gramercy.
[Enter PAGE.]
FOOL.
Look you, here comes my mistress' page.
PAGE. [To the FOOL.]
Why, how now, Captain! what do you in this wise company? How dost
thou, Apemantus?
APEMANTUS.
Would I had a rod in my mouth, that I might answer thee
profitably.
PAGE.
Prithee, Apemantus, read me the superscription of these
letters: I know not which is which.
APEMANTUS.
Canst not read?
PAGE.
No.
