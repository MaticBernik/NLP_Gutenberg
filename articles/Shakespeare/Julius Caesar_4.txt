[Thunders still.]
CASCA.
So can I:
So every bondman in his own hand bears
The power to cancel his captivity.
CASSIUS.
And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?
Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf,
But that he sees the Romans are but sheep:
He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.
Those that with haste will make a mighty fire
Begin it with weak straws: what trash is Rome,
What rubbish, and what offal, when it serves
For the base matter to illuminate
So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,
Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this
Before a willing bondman: then I know
My answer must be made; but I am arm'd,
And dangers are to me indifferent.
CASCA.
You speak to Casca; and to such a man
That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand:
Be factious for redress of all these griefs;
And I will set this foot of mine as far
As who goes farthest.
CASSIUS.
There's a bargain made.
Now know you, Casca, I have moved already
Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans
To undergo with me an enterprise
Of honorable-dangerous consequence;
And I do know by this, they stay for me
In Pompey's Porch: for now, this fearful night,
There is no stir or walking in the streets;
And the complexion of the element
Is favor'd like the work we have in hand,
Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.
CASCA.
Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.
CASSIUS.
'Tis Cinna; I do know him by his gait;
He is a friend.--
[Enter Cinna.]
Cinna, where haste you so?
CINNA.
To find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber?
CASSIUS.
No, it is Casca, one incorporate
To our attempts. Am I not stay'd for, Cinna?
CINNA.
I am glad on't. What a fearful night is this!
There's two or three of us have seen strange sights.
CASSIUS.
Am I not stay'd for? tell me.
CINNA.
Yes,
You are. O Cassius, if you could but win
The noble Brutus to our party,--
CASSIUS.
Be you content. Good Cinna, take this paper,
And look you lay it in the praetor's chair,
Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this
In at his window; set this up with wax
Upon old Brutus' statue: all this done,
Repair to Pompey's Porch, where you shall find us.
Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?
CINNA.
All but Metellus Cimber, and he's gone
To seek you at your house. Well, I will hie
And so bestow these papers as you bade me.
CASSIUS.
That done, repair to Pompey's theatre.--
[Exit Cinna.]
Come, Casca, you and I will yet, ere day,
See Brutus at his house: three parts of him
Is ours already; and the man entire,
Upon the next encounter, yields him ours.
CASCA.
O, he sits high in all the people's hearts!
And that which would appear offense in us,
His countenance, like richest alchemy,
Will change to virtue and to worthiness.
