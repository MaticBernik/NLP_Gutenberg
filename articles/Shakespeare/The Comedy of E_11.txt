_Ant. S._ Sweet mistress,--what your name is else, I know not,
    Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine,--                        30
Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not
    Than our earth's wonder; more than earth divine.
Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak;
    Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit,
Smother'd in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,                         35
    The folded meaning of your words' deceit.
Against my soul's pure truth why labour you
    To make it wander in an unknown field?
Are you a god? would you create me new?
    Transform me, then, and to your power I'll yield.               40
But if that I am I, then well I know
    Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,
Nor to her bed no homage do I owe:
    Far more, far more to you do I decline.
O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,                      45
    To drown me in thy sister flood of tears:
Sing, siren, for thyself, and I will dote:
    Spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs,
And as a bed I'll take them, and there lie;
    And, in that glorious supposition, think                        50
He gains by death that hath such means to die:
    Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!
_Luc._ What, are you mad, that you do reason so?
_Ant. S._ Not mad, but mated; how, I do not know.
_Luc._ It is a fault that springeth from your eye.                  55
_Ant. S._ For gazing on your beams, fair sun, being by.
_Luc._ Gaze where you should, and that will clear your sight.
_Ant. S._ As good to wink, sweet love, as look on night.
_Luc._ Why call you me love? call my sister so.
_Ant. S._ Thy sister's sister.
_Luc._                       That's my sister.
_Ant. S._                                    No;                    60
It is thyself, mine own self's better part,
Mine eye's clear eye, my dear heart's dearer heart,
My food, my fortune, and my sweet hope's aim,
My sole earth's heaven, and my heaven's claim.
_Luc._ All this my sister is, or else should be.                    65
_Ant. S._ Call thyself sister, sweet, for I am thee.
Thee will I love, and with thee lead my life:
Thou hast no husband yet, nor I no wife.
Give me thy hand.
_Luc._          O, soft, sir! hold you still:
I'll fetch my sister, to get her good will.    [_Exit._             70
  _Enter _DROMIO of Syracuse_._
_Ant. S._ Why, how now, Dromio! where runn'st thou
so fast?
_Dro. S._ Do you know me, sir? am I Dromio? am I
your man? am I myself?
_Ant. S._ Thou art Dromio, thou art my man, thou art                75
thyself.
_Dro. S._ I am an ass, I am a woman's man, and
besides myself.
_Ant. S._ What woman's man? and how besides thyself?
_Dro. S._ Marry, sir, besides myself, I am due to a                 80
woman; one that claims me, one that haunts me, one that
will have me.
_Ant. S._ What claim lays she to thee?
_Dro. S._ Marry, sir, such claim as you would lay to
your horse; and she would have me as a beast: not that,             85
I being a beast, she would have me; but that she, being
a very beastly creature, lays claim to me.
