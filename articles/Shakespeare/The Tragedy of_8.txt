COMINIUS.
So, to our tent;
Where, ere we do repose us, we will write
To Rome of our success.--You, Titus Lartius,
Must to Corioli back: send us to Rome
The best, with whom we may articulate
For their own good and ours.
LARTIUS.
I shall, my lord.
CORIOLANUS.
The gods begin to mock me. I, that now
Refus'd most princely gifts, am bound to beg
Of my lord general.
COMINIUS.
Take't: 'tis yours.--What is't?
CORIOLANUS.
I sometime lay here in Corioli
At a poor man's house; he used me kindly:
He cried to me; I saw him prisoner;
But then Aufidius was within my view,
And wrath o'erwhelmed my pity: I request you
To give my poor host freedom.
COMINIUS.
O, well begg'd!
Were he the butcher of my son, he should
Be free as is the wind. Deliver him, Titus.
LARTIUS.
Marcius, his name?
CORIOLANUS.
By Jupiter, forgot:--
I am weary; yea, my memory is tir'd.--
Have we no wine here?
COMINIUS.
Go we to our tent:
The blood upon your visage dries; 'tis time
It should be look'd to: come.
[Exeunt.]
SCENE X. The camp of the Volsces.
[A flourish. Cornets. Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS, bloody, with two or
three soldiers.]
AUFIDIUS.
The town is ta'en.
FIRST SOLDIER.
'Twill be delivered back on good condition.
AUFIDIUS.
Condition!
I would I were a Roman; for I cannot,
Being a Volsce, be that I am.--Condition?
What good condition can a treaty find
I' the part that is at mercy?--Five times, Marcius,
I have fought with thee; so often hast thou beat me;
And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter
As often as we eat.--By the elements,
If e'er again I meet him beard to beard,
He's mine or I am his: mine emulation
Hath not that honour in't it had; for where
I thought to crush him in an equal force,--
True sword to sword,--I'll potch at him some way,
Or wrath or craft may get him.
FIRST SOLDIER.
He's the devil.
AUFIDIUS.
Bolder, though not so subtle. My valour's poisoned
With only suffering stain by him; for him
Shall fly out of itself: nor sleep nor sanctuary,
Being naked, sick; nor fane nor Capitol,
The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice,
Embarquements all of fury, shall lift up
Their rotten privilege and custom 'gainst
My hate to Marcius: where I find him, were it
At home, upon my brother's guard, even there,
Against the hospitable canon, would I
Wash my fierce hand in's heart. Go you to the city;
Learn how 'tis held; and what they are that must
Be hostages for Rome.
FIRST SOLDIER.
Will not you go?
AUFIDIUS.
I am attended at the cypress grove: I pray you,--
'Tis south the city mills,--bring me word thither
How the world goes, that to the pace of it
I may spur on my journey.
FIRST SOLDIER.
I shall, sir.
[Exeunt.]
ACT II.
SCENE I. Rome. A public place
[Enter MENENIUS, SICINIUS, and BRUTUS.]
MENENIUS.
The augurer tells me we shall have news tonight.
