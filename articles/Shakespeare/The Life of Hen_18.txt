LINCOLN.
Very well, my liege.
KING.
I have spoke long; be pleas'd yourself to say
How far you satisfi'd me.
LINCOLN.
So please your Highness,
The question did at first so stagger me,
Bearing a state of mighty moment in't
And consequence of dread, that I committed
The daring'st counsel which I had to doubt;
And did entreat your Highness to this course
Which you are running here.
KING.
I then mov'd you,
My Lord of Canterbury; and got your leave
To make this present summons. Unsolicited
I left no reverend person in this court;
But by particular consent proceeded
Under your hands and seals.  Therefore, go on;
For no dislike i' the world against the person
Of the good queen, but the sharp thorny points
Of my alleged reasons, drives this forward.
Prove but our marriage lawful, by my life
And kingly dignity, we are contented
To wear our mortal state to come with her,
Katherine our queen, before the primest creature
That's paragon'd o' the world.
CAMPEIUS.
So please your Highness,
The Queen being absent, 'tis a needful fitness
That we adjourn this court till further day.
Meanwhile must be an earnest motion
Made to the Queen, to call back her appeal
She intends unto his Holiness.
KING.
[Aside.]  I may perceive
These Cardinals trifle with me; I abhor
This dilatory sloth and tricks of Rome.
My learn'd and well-beloved servant, Cranmer,
Prithee, return. With thy approach, I know,
My comfort comes along.--Break up the court!
I say, set on.
[Exuent in manner as they enter'd.]
ACT THIRD
SCENE I.  London. The Queen's apartments.
[The Queen and her women, as at work.]
QUEEN KATHERINE.
Take thy lute, wench; my soul grows
sad with troubles.
Sing, and disperse 'em, if thou canst. Leave working.
                SONG
Orpheus with his lute made trees
And the mountain tops that freeze
  Bow themselves when he did sing.
To his music plants and flowers
Ever sprung; as sun and showers
  There had made a lasting spring.
Every thing that heard him play,
Even the billows of the sea,
  Hung their heads, and then lay by.
In sweet music is such art,
Killing care and grief of heart
  Fall asleep, or hearing, die.
[Enter a Gentleman.]
QUEEN KATHERINE.
How now!
GENTLEMAN.
An't please your Grace, the two great Cardinals
Wait in the presence.
QUEEN KATHERINE.
Would they speak with me?
GENTLEMAN.
They will'd me say so, madam.
QUEEN KATHERINE.
Pray their Graces
To come near. [Exit Gentleman.] What can be their business
With me, a poor weak woman, fallen from favour?
I do not like their coming. Now I think on't,
They should be good men, their affairs as righteous.
But all hoods make not monks.
[Enter the two Cardinals, Wolsey and Campeius.]
WOLSEY.
Peace to your Highness!
QUEEN KATHERINE.
Your Graces find me here part of housewife;
I would be all, against the worst may happen.
What are your pleasures with me, reverend lords?
WOLSEY.
May it please you, noble madam, to withdraw
Into your private chamber, we shall give you
The full cause of our coming.
