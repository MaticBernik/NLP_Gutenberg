  To shallow rivers, to whose falls                                 15
  Melodious birds sings madrigals;
  There will we make our peds of roses,
  And a thousand fragrant posies.
  To shallow--
Mercy on me! I have a great dispositions to cry.    [_Sings._       20
  Melodious birds sing madrigals--
  Whenas I sat in Pabylon--
  And a thousand vagram posies.
  To shallow &c.
  _Re-enter SIMPLE._
_Sim._ Yonder he is coming, this way, Sir Hugh.                     25
_Evans._ He's welcome. --    [_Sings._
  To shallow rivers, to whose falls--
Heaven prosper the right!--What weapons is he?
_Sim._ No weapons, sir. There comes my master,
Master Shallow, and another gentleman, from Frogmore,               30
over the stile, this way.
_Evans._ Pray you, give me my gown; or else keep it
in your arms.
  _Enter PAGE, SHALLOW, and SLENDER._
_Shal._ How now, master parson! Good morrow, good
Sir Hugh. Keep a gamester from the dice, and a good                 35
student from his book, and it is wonderful.
_Slen._ [_Aside_] Ah, sweet Anne Page!
_Page._ Save you, good Sir Hugh!
_Evans._ Pless you from his mercy sake, all of you!
_Shal._ What, the sword and the word! do you study                  40
them both, master parson?
_Page._ And youthful still! in your doublet and hose
this raw rheumatic day!
_Evans._ There is reasons and causes for it.
_Page._ We are come to you to do a good office, master              45
parson.
_Evans._ Fery well: what is it?
_Page._ Yonder is a most reverend gentleman, who, belike
having received wrong by some person, is at most odds
with his own gravity and patience that ever you saw.                50
_Shal._ I have lived fourscore years and upward; I never
heard a man of his place, gravity, and learning, so wide of
his own respect.
_Evans._ What is he?
_Page._ I think you know him; Master Doctor Caius,                  55
the renowned French physician.
_Evans._ Got's will, and his passion of my heart! I had
as lief you would tell me of a mess of porridge.
_Page._ Why?
_Evans._ He has no more knowledge in Hibocrates and                 60
Galen,--and he is a knave besides; a cowardly knave as
you would desires to be acquainted withal.
_Page._ I warrant you, he's the man should fight with
him.
_Slen._ [_Aside_] O sweet Anne Page!                                65
_Shal._ It appears so, by his weapons. Keep them asunder:
here comes Doctor Caius.
  _Enter HOST, CAIUS, and RUGBY._
_Page._ Nay, good master parson, keep in your weapon.
_Shal._ So do you, good master doctor.
_Host._ Disarm them, and let them question: let them                70
keep their limbs whole, and hack our English.
_Caius._ I pray you, let-a me speak a word with your
ear. Verefore vill you not meet-a me?
_Evans._ [_Aside to Caius_] Pray you, use your patience:
in good time.                                                       75
_Caius._ By gar, you are de coward, de Jack dog, John
ape.
_Evans._ [_Aside to Caius_] Pray you, let us not be laughing-stocks
to other men's humours; I desire you in friendship,
and I will one way or other make you amends.                        80
[_Aloud_] I will knog your urinals about your knave's cogscomb
[for missing your meetings and appointments].
