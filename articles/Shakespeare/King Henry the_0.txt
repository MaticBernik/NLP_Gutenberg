SCENE I.--THE PAINTED CHAMBER IN THE ROYAL PALACE AT WESTMINSTER.
    [Frequent reference is made in the Chronicles to the Painted
    Chamber, as the room wherein Henry V. held his councils.]
  _Trumpets sound._
    _KING HENRY(B) discovered on his throne (CENTRE)[*], BEDFORD,(C)
    GLOSTER,(D) EXETER,(E) WARWICK, WESTMORELAND, and others in
    attendance._
    [Footnote *: The throne is powdered with the letter S. This
    decoration made its appearance in the reign of Henry IV., and
    has been differently accounted for. The late Sir Samuel Meyrick
    supposes it to be the initial letter of Henry's motto,
    "Souveraine." The King's costume is copied from Strutt's "Regal
    Antiquities." The dresses of the English throughout the play are
    taken from the works of Strutt, Meyrick, Shaw, and Hamilton Smith.
    The heraldry has been kindly supplied by Thomas Willement, Esq.,
    F.S.A. The Lord Great Chamberlain carrying the sword of state is
    De Vere, Earl of Oxford.]
  _K. Hen._ Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury?
  _Exe._ (L.) Not here in presence.
  _K. Hen._ Send for him, good uncle.
    [_EXETER beckons to a HERALD, who goes off, L.H._
  _West._ (L.) Shall we call in the ambassador, my liege?
  _K. Hen._ Not yet, my cousin: we would be resolv'd,
  Before we hear him, of some things of weight,
  That task[1] our thoughts, concerning us and France.
    _Re-enter HERALD with the Archbishop of CANTERBURY,(F)[2] and
    Bishop of ELY,[3] L.H. The Bishops cross to R.C._
  _Cant._ (R.C.) Heaven and its angels guard your sacred throne,
  And make you long become it!
  _K. Hen._                  Sure, we thank you.
  My learned lord, we pray you to proceed,
  And justly and religiously unfold,
  Why the law Salique,(G) that they have in France,
  Or should, or should not, bar us in our claim:
  And Heaven forbid, my dear and faithful lord,
  That you should fashion, wrest,[4] or bow your reading,[5]
  Or nicely charge your understanding soul[6]
  With opening titles miscreate,[7] whose right
  Suits not in native colours with the truth.
  For Heaven doth know how many, now in health,
  Shall drop their blood in approbation[8]
  Of what your reverence shall incite us to.
  Therefore take heed how you impawn our person,[9]
  How you awake the sleeping sword of war:
  We charge you, in the name of Heaven, take heed:
  Under this conjuration, speak, my lord.
  _Cant._ (R.C.) Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,
  That owe your lives, your faith, and services,
  To this imperial throne.--There is no bar
  To make against your highness' claim to France
  But this, which they produce from Pharamond,--
  _No woman shall succeed in Salique land_:
  Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze[10]
  To be the realm of France, and Pharamond
  The founder of this law and female bar.
  Yet their own authors faithfully affirm
  That the land Salique lies in Germany,
  Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;
  Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,
  There left behind and settled certain French:
  Nor did the French possess the Salique land
  Until four hundred one and twenty years
  After defunction of King Pharamond,
  Idly supposed the founder of this law.
  Besides, their writers say,
  King Pepin, which deposed Childerick,
  Did hold in right and title of the female:
  So do the kings of France unto this day;
  Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law
  To bar your highness claiming from the female;
  And rather choose to hide them in a net
  Than amply to imbare their crooked titles[11]
  Usurp'd from you and your progenitors.
