_Pros._ Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban,                    285
Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know'st
What torment I did find thee in; thy groans
Did make wolves howl, and penetrate the breasts
Of ever-angry bears: it was a torment
To lay upon the damn'd, which Sycorax                              290
Could not again undo: it was mine art,
When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape
The pine, and let thee out.
_Ari._                    I thank thee, master.
_Pros._ If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oak,
And peg thee in his knotty entrails, till                          295
Thou hast howl'd away twelve winters.
_Ari._                              Pardon, master:
I will be correspondent to command,
And do my spiriting gently.
_Pros._                   Do so; and after two days
I will discharge thee.
_Ari._               That's my noble master!
What shall I do? say what; what shall I do?                        300
_Pros._ Go make thyself like a nymph o' the sea:
Be subject to no sight but thine and mine; invisible
To every eyeball else. Go take this shape,
And hither come in't: go, hence with diligence!
    [_Exit Ariel._
Awake, dear heart, awake! thou hast slept well;                    305
Awake!
_Mir._ The strangeness of your story put
Heaviness in me.
_Pros._        Shake it off. Come on;
We'll visit Caliban my slave, who never
Yields us kind answer.
_Mir._               'Tis a villain, sir,
I do not love to look on.
_Pros._                 But, as 'tis,                              310
We cannot miss him: he does make our fire,
Fetch in our wood, and serves in offices
That profit us. What, ho! slave! Caliban!
Thou earth, thou! speak.
_Cal._ [_within_] There's wood enough within.
_Pros._ Come forth, I say! there's other business for thee:        315
Come, thou tortoise! when?
  _Re-enter ARIEL like a water-nymph._
Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel,
Hark in thine ear.
_Ari._           My lord, it shall be done.    [_Exit._
_Pros._ Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself
Upon thy wicked dam, come forth!                                   320
  _Enter CALIBAN._
_Cal._ As wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'd
With raven's feather from unwholesome fen
Drop on you both! a south-west blow on ye
And blister you all o'er!
_Pros._ For this, be sure, to-night thou shalt have cramps,        325
Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up; urchins
Shall, for that vast of night that they may work,
All exercise on thee; thou shalt be pinch'd
As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging
Than bees that made 'em.
_Cal._                 I must eat my dinner.                       330
This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother,
Which thou takest from me. When thou camest first,
Thou strokedst me, and madest much of me; wouldst give me
Water with berries in't; and teach me how
To name the bigger light, and how the less,                        335
That burn by day and night: and then I loved thee,
And show'd thee all the qualities o' th' isle,
The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile:
Curs'd be I that did so! All the charms
Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!                    340
For I am all the subjects that you have,
Which first was mine own king: and here you sty me
In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me
The rest o' th' island.
