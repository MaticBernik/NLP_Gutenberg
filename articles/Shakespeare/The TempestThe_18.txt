_Fer._                My mistress, dearest;
And I thus humble ever.
_Mir._                My husband, then?
_Fer._ Ay, with a heart as willing
As bondage e'er of freedom: here's my hand.
_Mir._ And mine, with my heart in't: and now farewell               90
Till half an hour hence.
_Fer._                 A thousand thousand!
    [_Exeunt Fer. and Mir. severally._
_Pros._ So glad of this as they I cannot be,
Who are surprised withal; but my rejoicing
At nothing can be more. I'll to my book;
For yet, ere supper-time, must I perform                            95
Much business appertaining.    [_Exit._

SCENE II. _Another part of the island._
  _Enter CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO._
_Ste._ Tell not me;--when the butt is out, we will drink
water; not a drop before: therefore bear up, and board 'em.
Servant-monster, drink to me.
_Trin._ Servant-monster! the folly of this island! They
say there's but five upon this isle: we are three of them; if        5
th' other two be brained like us, the state totters.
_Ste._ Drink, servant-monster, when I bid thee: thy eyes
are almost set in thy head.
_Trin._ Where should they be set else? he were a brave
monster indeed, if they were set in his tail.                       10
_Ste._ My man-monster hath drowned his tongue in sack:
for my part, the sea cannot drown me; I swam, ere I could
recover the shore, five-and-thirty leagues off and on. By
this light, thou shalt be my lieutenant, monster, or my
standard.                                                           15
_Trin._ Your lieutenant, if you list; he's no standard.
_Ste._ We'll not run, Monsieur Monster.
_Trin._ Nor go neither; but you'll lie, like dogs, and
yet say nothing neither.
_Ste._ Moon-calf, speak once in thy life, if thou beest a           20
good moon-calf.
_Cal._ How does thy honour? Let me lick thy shoe.
I'll not serve him, he is not valiant.
