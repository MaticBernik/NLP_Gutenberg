    'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves:'
I will assume desert:--Give me a key for this,
And instantly unlock my fortunes here.
_Por_. Too long a pause for that which you find there.
_Arr_. What's here: the portrait of a blinking idiot,
Presenting me a schedule? I will read it.
        Some there be that shadows kiss;
        Such have but a shadow's bliss:
        There be fools alive, I wis,[75]
        Silver'd o'er; and so was this.'
    Still more fool I shall appear
    By the time I linger here:
    With one fool's head I came to woo,
    But I go away with two.
Sweet, adieu! I'll keep my oath,
Patiently to bear my wroath.[76]
[_Exeunt_ ARRAGON _and Train_.
_Por_. Thus hath the candle sing'd the moth.
O these deliberate fools! when they do choose,
They have the wisdom by their wit to lose.
_Ner_. The ancient saying is no heresy;--
Hanging and wiving goes by destiny.
_Enter_ BALTHAZAR.
_Ser_. Madam, there is alighted at your gate
A young Venetian, one that comes before
To signify the approaching of his lord:
From whom he bringeth sensible regreets;[77]
To wit, besides commends and courteous breath,
Gifts of rich value; yet I have not seen
So likely an ambassador of love.
_Por_. No more, I pray thee.
Come, come, Nerissa; for I long to see
Quick Cupid's post that comes so mannerly.
_Ner_. Bassanio, lord love, if thy will it be!
[_Exeunt_.

SCENE II.--RIALTO BRIDGE (A), AND GRAND CANAL.
_Enter_ SALARINO _and_ SALANIO.
_Salar_. Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail;
With him is Gratiano gone along;
And in their ship, I am sure, Lorenzo is not.
_Sal_. The villain Jew with outcries rais'd the duke;
Who went with him to search Bassanio's ship.
_Salar_. He came too late, the ship was under sail;
But there the duke was given to understand,
That in a gondola were seen together
Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica;
Besides, Antonio certified the duke,
They were not with Bassanio in his ship.
_Sal_. I never heard a passion so confus'd,
So strange, outrageous, and so variable,
As the dog Jew did utter in the streets;
"_My daughter!--O, my ducats!--O, my daughter!
Fled with a Christian!--O, my Christian ducats!--
Justice! the law! my ducats, and my daughter.!"_
Let good Antonio look he keep his day,
Or he shall pay for this.
_Salar_. Marry, well remember'd: I reason'd[78] with a Frenchman
yesterday, who told me that Antonio hath a ship of rich lading wreck'd
on the narrow seas that part the French and English,--the Goodwins, I
think they call the place--a very dangerous flat and fatal, where the
carcases of many a tall ship lie buried, as they say, if my gossip
report be an honest woman of her word.
