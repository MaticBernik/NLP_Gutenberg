_Isab._ Doth he so seek his life?
_Lucio._                        Has censured him
Already; and, as I hear, the provost hath
A warrant for his execution.
_Isab._ Alas! what poor ability's in me                             75
To do him good?
_Lucio._      Assay the power you have.
_Isab._ My power? Alas, I doubt,--
_Lucio._                         Our doubts are traitors,
And make us lose the good we oft might win
By fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo,
And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,                        80
Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,
All their petitions are as freely theirs
As they themselves would owe them.
_Isab._ I'll see what I can do.
_Lucio._                      But speedily.
_Isab._ I will about it straight;                                   85
No longer staying but to give the Mother
Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you:
Commend me to my brother: soon at night
I'll send him certain word of my success.
_Lucio._ I take my leave of you.
_Isab._                        Good sir, adieu.                     90

ACT II.
SCENE I. _A hall in ANGELO'S house._
  _Enter ANGELO, ESCALUS, and a _Justice, Provost, Officers_,
    and other _Attendants_, behind._
_Ang._ We must not make a scarecrow of the law,
Setting it up to fear the birds of prey,
And let it keep one shape, till custom make it
Their perch, and not their terror.
_Escal._                         Ay, but yet
Let us be keen, and rather cut a little,                             5
Than fall, and bruise to death. Alas, this gentleman,
Whom I would save, had a most noble father!
Let but your honour know,
Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue,
That, in the working of your own affections,                        10
Had time cohered with place or place with wishing,
Or that the resolute acting of your blood
Could have attain'd the effect of your own purpose,
Whether you had not sometime in your life
Err'd in this point which now you censure him,                      15
And pull'd the law upon you.
