THIRD CITIZEN.
We have been called so of many; not that our heads are some
brown, some black, some auburn, some bald, but that our wits are
so diversely coloured; and truly I think if all our wits were to
issue out of one skull, they would fly east, west, north, south;
and their consent of one direct way should be at once to all the
points o' the compass.
SECOND CITIZEN.
Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit would fly?
THIRD CITIZEN.
Nay, your wit will not so soon out as another man's will,--'tis
strongly wedged up in a block-head; but if it were at liberty
'twould, sure, southward.
SECOND CITIZEN.
Why that way?
THIRD CITIZEN.
To lose itself in a fog; where being three parts melted away with
rotten dews, the fourth would return for conscience' sake, to
help to get thee a wife.
SECOND CITIZEN.
You are never without your tricks:--you may, you may.
THIRD CITIZEN.
Are you all resolved to give your voices? But that's no matter,
the greater part carries it. I say, if he would incline to the
people, there was never a worthier man. Here he comes, and in the
gown of humility. Mark his behaviour. We are not to stay all
together, but to come by him where he stands, by ones, by twos,
and by threes. He's to make his requests by particulars, wherein
every one of us has a single honour, in giving him our own voices
with our own tongues; therefore follow me, and I'll direct you
how you shall go by him.
ALL.
Content, content.
[Exeunt.]
[Enter CORIOLANUS and MENENIUS.]
MENENIUS.
O sir, you are not right; have you not known
The worthiest men have done't!
CORIOLANUS.
What must I say?--
'I pray, sir'--Plague upon't! I cannot bring
My tongue to such a pace.--'Look, sir,--my wounds;--
I got them in my country's service, when
Some certain of your brethren roar'd, and ran
From the noise of our own drums.'
MENENIUS.
O me, the gods!
You must not speak of that: you must desire them
To think upon you.
CORIOLANUS.
Think upon me! Hang 'em!
I would they would forget me, like the virtues
Which our divines lose by 'em.
MENENIUS.
You'll mar all:
I'll leave you. Pray you speak to 'em, I pray you,
In wholesome manner.
CORIOLANUS.
Bid them wash their faces
And keep their teeth clean.
[Exit MENENIUS.]
So, here comes a brace:
[Re-enter two citizens.]
You know the cause, sirs, of my standing here.
FIRST CITIZEN.
We do, sir; tell us what hath brought you to't.
CORIOLANUS.
Mine own desert.
SECOND CITIZEN.
Your own desert?
CORIOLANUS.
Ay, not mine own desire.
FIRST CITIZEN.
How! not your own desire!
CORIOLANUS.
No, sir, 'twas never my desire yet to trouble the poor with
begging.
FIRST CITIZEN.
You must think, if we give you anything, we hope to gain by you.
CORIOLANUS.
Well then, I pray, your price o' the consulship?
FIRST CITIZEN.
The price is to ask it kindly.
