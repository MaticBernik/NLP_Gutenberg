[Footnote 11: The connection is:
    That for some vicious mole--
    As by their o'ergrowth--
    Or by some habit, &c.]
[Footnote 12: pleasing.]
[Footnote 13: Repeat from above '--so oft it chaunces,' before 'that
these men.']
[Footnote 14: 'whether the thing come by Nature or by Destiny,'
_Fortune's star_: the mark set on a man by fortune to prove her share in
him. 83.]
[Footnote 15: A change to the singular.]
[Footnote l6: 'be his virtues besides as pure &c.']
[Footnote 17: _walk under; carry_.]
[Footnote 18: the judgment of the many.]
[Footnote 19: 'Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send
forth a stinking savour: so doth a little folly him that is in
reputation for wisdom and honour.' Eccles. x. 1.]
[Footnote 20: Compare Quarto reading, page 112:
    The spirit that I haue scene
    May be a deale, and the deale hath power &c.
If _deale_ here stand for _devil_, then _eale_ may in the same edition
be taken to stand for _evil_. It is hardly necessary to suspect a Scotch
printer; _evil_ is often used as a monosyllable, and _eale_ may have
been a pronunciation of it half-way towards _ill_, which is its
contraction.]
[Footnote 21: I do not believe there is any corruption in the rest of
the passage. 'Doth it of a doubt:' _affects it with a doubt_, brings it
into doubt. The following from _Measure for Measure_, is like, though
not the same.
    I have on Angelo imposed the office,
    Who may, in the ambush of my name, strike home
    And yet my nature never in the fight
    _To do in slander._
'To do my nature in slander'; to affect it with slander; to bring it
into slander, 'Angelo may punish in my name, but, not being present, I
shall not be accused of cruelty, which would be to slander my nature.']
[Footnote 22: _his_--the man's; see _note_ 13 above.]

[Sidenote: 112] Be thy euents wicked or charitable,
                                                  [Sidenote: thy intent]
Thou com'st in such a questionable shape[1]
That I will speake to thee. Ile call thee _Hamlet_,[2]
King, Father, Royall Dane: Oh, oh, answer me,
                                             [Sidenote: Dane, o answere]
Let me not burst in Ignorance; but tell
Why thy Canoniz'd bones Hearsed in death,[3]
Haue burst their cerments; why the Sepulcher
Wherein we saw thee quietly enurn'd,[4]
                                         [Sidenote: quietly interr'd[3]]
Hath op'd his ponderous and Marble iawes,
To cast thee vp againe? What may this meane?
That thou dead Coarse againe in compleat steele,
Reuisits thus the glimpses of the Moone,
Making Night hidious? And we fooles of Nature,[6]
So horridly to shake our disposition,[7]
With thoughts beyond thee; reaches of our Soules,[8]
                                                 [Sidenote: the reaches]
Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we doe?[9]
_Ghost beckens Hamlet._
_Hor._ It beckons you to goe away with it,           [Sidenote: Beckins]
As if it some impartment did desire
To you alone.
_Mar._ Looke with what courteous action
It wafts you to a more remoued ground:                 [Sidenote: waues]
But doe not goe with it.
