MARINA.
You will not do 't for all the world, I hope.
You are well favour'd, and your looks foreshow
You have a gentle heart.  I saw you lately,
When you caught hurt in parting two that fought:
Good sooth, it show'd well in you: do so now:
Your lady seeks my life; come you between,
And save poor me, the weaker.
LEONINE.
I am sworn,
And will dispatch.
[He seizes her.]
[Enter Pirates.]
FIRST PIRATE.
Hold, villain!
[Leonine runs away.]
SECOND PIRATE.
A prize! a prize!
THIRD PIRATE.
Half-part, mates, half-part,
Comes, let's have her aboard suddenly.
[Exeunt Pirates with Marina.]
[Re-enter Leonine.]
LEONINE.
These roguing thieves serve the great pirate Valdes;
And they hav seized Marina. Let her go:
Thre's no hope she will return. I'll swear she's dead
And thrown into the sea. But I'll see further:
Perhaps they will but please themselves upon her,
Not carry her aboard.  If she remain,
Whom they have ravish'd must by me be slain.
[Exit.]
Scene II. Mytilene.  A room in a brothel.
[Enter Pandar, Bawd, and Boult.]
PANDAR.
Boult!
BOULT.
Sir?
PANDAR.
Search the market narrowly; Mytilene is full of gallants. We lost
too much money this mart by being too wenchless.
BAWD.
We were never so much out of creatures. We have but poor three,
and they can do no more than they can do; and they with continual
action are even as good as rotten.
PANDAR.
Therefore let's have fresh ones, whate'r we pay for them.  If
there be not a conscience to be used in every trade, we shall
never prosper.
BAWD.
Thou sayest true: 'tis not our bringing up of poor bastards, --
as, I think, I have bought up some eleven --
BOULT.
Ay, to eleven; and brought them down again. But shall I search
the market?
BAWD.
What else, man?  The stuff we have, a strong wind will blo it to
pieces, they are so pitifully sodden.
PANDAR.
Thou sayest true; they're too unwholesome, o' conscience. The
poor Transylvanian is dead, that lay with the little baggage.
BOULT.
Ay, she quickly pooped him; she made him roast-meat for worms.
But I'll go search the market.
[Exit.]
PANDAR.
Three or four thousand chequins were as pretty a proportion to
live quietly, and so give over.
BAWD.
Wgy to give over, I pray you? is it a shame to get when we are
old?
PANDAR.
O, our credit comes not in like the commodity , nor the commodity
wages not with the danger: therfore, if in our youths we could
pick up some pretty estate, 'twere not amiss to keep our door
hatched.  Besides, the sore terms we stand upon with the gods will
be strong with us for giving over.
BAWD.
Come, others sorts offend as well as we.
PANDAR.
As well as we! ay, and better too; we offend worse. Neither is
our profession any trade; it's no calling.  But here comes Boult.
[Re-enter Boult, with the Pirates and Marina.]
BOULT
[To Marina.]
Come your ways. My masters, you say she's a virgin?
