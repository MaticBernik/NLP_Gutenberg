SCENE II. PADUA. _Before_ HORTENSIO'S _house_.
_Enter_ PETRUCHIO _and his man_ GRUMIO.
    _Pet._ Verona, for a while I take my leave,
    To see my friends in Padua, but of all
    My best beloved and approved friend,
    Hortensio; and I trow this is his house.
    Here, sirrah Grumio; knock, I say.                                 5
    _Gru._ Knock, sir! whom should I knock? is there any
    man has rebused your worship?
    _Pet._ Villain, I say, knock me here soundly.
    _Gru._ Knock you here, sir! why, sir, what am I, sir,
    that I should knock you here, sir?                                10
    _Pet._ Villain, I say, knock me at this gate
    And rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate.
    _Gru._ My master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock you first,
    And then I know after who comes by the worst.
    _Pet._ Will it not be?                                            15
    Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock, I'll ring it;
    I'll try how you can _sol_, _fa_, and sing it.
                                   [_He wrings him by the ears._
    _Gru._ Help, masters, help! my master is mad.
    _Pet._ Now, knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!
_Enter_ HORTENSIO.
    _Hor._ How now! what's the matter? My old friend Grumio!          20
    and my good friend Petruchio! How do you all at
    Verona?
    _Pet._ Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?
    'Con tutto il core ben trovato,' may I say.
    _Hor._ 'Alla nostra casa ben venuto, molto honorato               25
    signor mio Petrucio.'
    Rise, Grumio, rise: we will compound this quarrel.
    _Gru._ Nay, 'tis no matter, sir, what he 'leges in Latin. If
    this be not a lawful cause for me to leave his service, look
    you, sir, he bid me knock him and rap him soundly, sir:           30
    well, was it fit for a servant to use his master so, being perhaps,
    for aught I see, two-and-thirty, a pip out?
    Whom would to God I had well knock'd at first,
    Then had not Grumio come by the worst.
    _Pet._ A senseless villain! Good Hortensio,                       35
    I bade the rascal knock upon your gate
    And could not get him for my heart to do it.
