[_As he is going out in haste_
_Enter_ OLD GOBBO, _with a basket_.
_Gob_. Master, young man, you, I pray you; which is the way to master
Jew's?
_Lau. (aside.)_ O heavens, this is my true-begotten father! who, being
more than sand-blind, high-gravel blind,[45] knows me not: I will try
conclusions[46] with him.
_Gob_. Master young gentleman, I pray you which is the way to master
Jew's?
_Lau_. Turn upon your right hand at the next turning, but, at the next
turning of all, on your left; marry, at the very next turning, turn of
no hand, but turn down indirectly to the Jew's house.[47]
_Gob_. 'Twill be a hard way to hit. Can you tell me whether one
Launcelot that dwells with him, dwell with him, or no?
_Lau_, Talk you of young master Launcelot?--mark me,
now--_(aside.)_--now will I raise the waters.[48] Talk you of young
master Launcelot?
_Gob_. No master, sir: but a poor man's son: his father, though I say
it, is an honest exceeding poor man, and, Heaven be thanked, well to
live.
_Lau_, Well, let his father be what he will, we talk of young master
Launcelot.
_Gob_. Of Launcelot, an't please your mastership.[49]
_Lau. Ergo_, master Launcelot; talk not of master Launcelot, father; for
the young gentleman (according to fates and destinies, and such odd
sayings, the sisters three, and such branches of learning), is, indeed,
deceased; or, as you would say in plain terms, gone to heaven.
_Gob_. Marry, Heaven forbid! the boy was the very staff of my age, my
very prop.
_Lau_. Do I look like a cudgel, or a hovel-post, a staff, or a prop?--Do
you know me, father?
_Gob_. Alack the day, I know you not, young gentleman; but, I pray you
tell me, is my boy (rest his soul!) alive or dead?
_Lau_. Do you not know me, father?
_Gob_. Alack! sir, I am sand-blind, I know you not.
_Lau_. Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail of the knowing
me: it is a wise father that knows his own child. Well, old man, I will
tell you news of your son: Give me your blessing: _(kneels.)_ Truth will
come to light; murder cannot be hid long; a man's son may; but, in the
end, truth will out.
_Gob_. Pray you, sir, stand up: I am sure you are not Launcelot, my boy.
_Lau_. Pray you, let's have no more fooling about it, but give me your
blessing; I am Launcelot, your boy that was, your son that is, your
child that shall be.
_Gob_. I cannot think you are my son.
_Lau_. I know not what I shall think of that; but I am Launcelot, the
Jew's man; and I am sure Margery, your wife, is my mother.
_Gob_. Her name is Margery, indeed: I'll be sworn if thou be Launcelot,
thou art mine own flesh and blood. What a beard hast thou got: thou hast
got more hair on thy chin than Dobbin, my phill-horse,[50] has on his
tail.
