SCENE II. _A room in the Garter Inn._
  _Enter FALSTAFF and PISTOL._
_Fal._ I will not lend thee a penny.
_Pist._ Why, then the world's mine oyster,
Which I with sword will open.
_Fal._ Not a penny. I have been content, sir, you
should lay my countenance to pawn: I have grated upon                5
my good friends for three reprieves for you and your coach-fellow
Nym; or else you had looked through the grate,
like a geminy of baboons. I am damned in hell for swearing
to gentlemen my friends, you were good soldiers and
tall fellows; and when Mistress Bridget lost the handle of          10
her fan, I took't upon mine honour thou hadst it not.
_Pist._ Didst not thou share? hadst thou not fifteen
pence?
_Fal._ Reason, you rogue, reason: thinkest thou I'll endanger
my soul gratis? At a word, hang no more about                       15
me, I am no gibbet for you. Go. A short knife and a
throng!--To your manor of Pickt-hatch! Go. You'll not
bear a letter for me, you rogue! you stand upon your
honour! Why, thou unconfinable baseness, it is as much as
I can do to keep the terms of my honour precise: I, I, I            20
myself sometimes, leaving the fear of God on the left hand,
and hiding mine honour in my necessity, am fain to shuffle,
to hedge, and to lurch; and yet you, rogue, will ensconce
your rags, your cat-a-mountain looks, your red-lattice
phrases, and your bold-beating oaths, under the shelter of          25
your honour! You will not do it, you!
_Pist._ I do relent: what would thou more of man?
  _Enter ROBIN._
_Rob._ Sir, here's a woman would speak with you.
_Fal._ Let her approach.
  _Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY._
_Quick._ Give your worship good morrow.                             30
_Fal._ Good morrow, good wife.
_Quick._ Not so, an't please your worship.
_Fal._ Good maid, then.
_Quick._ I'll be sworn;
As my mother was, the first hour I was born.                        35
_Fal._ I do believe the swearer. What with me?
_Quick._ Shall I vouchsafe your worship a word or two?
_Fal._ Two thousand, fair woman: and I'll vouchsafe
thee the hearing.
_Quick._ There is one Mistress Ford, sir:--I pray, come             40
a little nearer this ways:--I myself dwell with Master
Doctor Caius,--
_Fal._ Well, on: Mistress Ford, you say,--
_Quick._ Your worship says very true:--I pray your
worship, come a little nearer this ways.                            45
_Fal._ I warrant thee, nobody hears;--mine own people,
mine own people.
_Quick._ Are they so? God bless them, and make them
his servants!
_Fal._ Well, Mistress Ford;--what of her?                           50
_Quick._ Why, sir, she's a good creature. --Lord, Lord!
your worship's a wanton! Well, heaven forgive you and
all of us, I pray!
_Fal._ Mistress Ford;--come, Mistress Ford,--
_Quick._ Marry, this is the short and the long of it; you           55
have brought her into such a canaries as 'tis wonderful.
The best courtier of them all, when the court lay at Windsor,
could never have brought her to such a canary. Yet
there has been knights, and lords, and gentlemen, with their
coaches; I warrant you, coach after coach, letter after letter,     60
gift after gift; smelling so sweetly, all musk, and so
rushling, I warrant you, in silk and gold; and in such alligant
terms; and in such wine and sugar of the best and the
fairest, that would have won any woman's heart; and, I
warrant you, they could never get an eye-wink of her: I             65
had myself twenty angels given me this morning; but
I defy all angels--in any such sort, as they say--but in the
way of honesty: and, I warrant you, they could never get
her so much as sip on a cup with the proudest of them all:
and yet there has been earls, nay, which is more, pensioners;       70
but, I warrant you, all is one with her.
