CRESSIDA.
So he says here.
PANDARUS.
True, he was so; I know the cause too; he'll lay about
him today, I can tell them that. And there's Troilus will not
come far behind him; let them take heed of Troilus, I can tell
them that too.
CRESSIDA.
What, is he angry too?
PANDARUS.
Who, Troilus? Troilus is the better man of the two.
CRESSIDA.
O Jupiter! there's no comparison.
PANDARUS.
What, not between Troilus and Hector? Do you know a man
if you see him?
CRESSIDA.
Ay, if I ever saw him before and knew him.
PANDARUS.
Well, I say Troilus is Troilus.
CRESSIDA.
Then you say as I say, for I am sure he is not Hector.
PANDARUS.
No, nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees.
CRESSIDA.
'Tis just to each of them: he is himself.
PANDARUS.
Himself! Alas, poor Troilus! I would he were!
CRESSIDA.
So he is.
PANDARUS.
Condition I had gone barefoot to India.
CRESSIDA.
He is not Hector.
PANDARUS.
Himself! no, he's not himself. Would 'a were himself!
Well, the gods are above; time must friend or end. Well, Troilus,
well! I would my heart were in her body! No, Hector is not a
better man than Troilus.
CRESSIDA.
Excuse me.
PANDARUS.
He is elder.
CRESSIDA.
Pardon me, pardon me.
PANDARUS.
Th' other's not come to't; you shall tell me another tale
when th' other's come to't. Hector shall not have his wit this
year.
CRESSIDA.
He shall not need it if he have his own.
ANDARUS.
Nor his qualities.
CRESSIDA.
No matter.
PANDARUS.
Nor his beauty.
CRESSIDA.
'Twould not become him: his own's better.
PANDARUS.
You have no judgment, niece. Helen herself swore th'
other day that Troilus, for a brown favour, for so 'tis, I must
confess--not brown neither--
CRESSIDA.
No, but brown.
PANDARUS.
Faith, to say truth, brown and not brown.
CRESSIDA.
To say the truth, true and not true.
PANDARUS.
She prais'd his complexion above Paris.
CRESSIDA.
Why, Paris hath colour enough.
PANDARUS.
So he has.
CRESSIDA.
Then Troilus should have too much. If she prais'd him
above, his complexion is higher than his; he having colour
enough, and the other higher, is too flaming praise for a good
complexion. I had as lief Helen's golden tongue had commended
Troilus for a copper nose.
PANDARUS.
I swear to you I think Helen loves him better than Paris.
CRESSIDA.
Then she's a merry Greek indeed.
PANDARUS.
Nay, I am sure she does. She came to him th' other day
into the compass'd window--and you know he has not past three or
four hairs on his chin--
CRESSIDA.
Indeed a tapster's arithmetic may soon bring his
particulars therein to a total.
PANDARUS.
Why, he is very young, and yet will he within three pound
lift as much as his brother Hector.
CRESSIDA.
Is he so young a man and so old a lifter?
PANDARUS.
But to prove to you that Helen loves him: she came and
puts me her white hand to his cloven chin--
