_Sil._ And when it's writ, for my sake read it over,
And if it please you, so; if not, why, so.                         120
_Val._ If it please me, madam, what then?
_Sil._ Why, if it please you, take it for your labour:
And so, good morrow, servant.    [_Exit._
_Speed._ O jest unseen, inscrutable, invisible,
As a nose on a man's face, or a weathercock on a steeple!          125
My master sues to her; and she hath taught her suitor,
He being her pupil, to become her tutor.
O excellent device! was there ever heard a better,
That my master, being scribe, to himself should write the letter?
_Val._ How now, sir? what are you reasoning with                   130
yourself?
_Speed._ Nay. I was rhyming: 'tis you that have the reason.
_Val._ To do what?
_Speed._ To be a spokesman for Madam Silvia.                       135
_Val._ To whom?
_Speed._ To yourself: why, she wooes you by a figure.
_Val._ What figure?
_Speed._ By a letter, I should say.
_Val._ Why, she hath not writ to me?                               140
_Speed._ What need she, when she hath made you write
to yourself? Why, do you not perceive the jest?
_Val._ No, believe me.
_Speed._ No believing you, indeed, sir. But did you perceive
her earnest?                                                       145
_Val._ She gave me none, except an angry word.
_Speed._ Why, she hath given you a letter.
_Val._ That's the letter I writ to her friend.
_Speed._ And that letter hath she delivered, and there
an end.                                                            150
_Val._ I would it were no worse.
_Speed._ I'll warrant you, 'tis as well:
For often have you writ to her; and she, in modesty,
Or else for want of idle time, could not again reply;
Or fearing else some messenger, that might her mind discover,      155
Herself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover.
All this I speak in print, for in print I found it. Why muse
you, sir? 'tis dinner-time.
_Val._ I have dined.
_Speed._ Ay, but hearken, sir; though the chameleon                160
Love can feed on the air, I am one that am nourished by
my victuals, and would fain have meat. O, be not like
your mistress; be moved, be moved.    [_Exeunt._
