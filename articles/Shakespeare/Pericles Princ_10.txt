ESCANES.
'Twas very strange
HELICANUS.
And yet but justice; for though
This king were great; his greatness was no guard.
To bar heaven's shaft, but sin had his reward.
ESCANES.
'Tis very true.
[Enter two or three Lords.]
FIRST LORD.
See, not a man in private conference
Or council has respect with him but he.
SECOND LORD.
It shall no longer grieve with out reproof.
THIRD LORD.
And cursed be he that will not second it.
FIRST LORD.
Follow me, then.  Lord Helicane, a word.
HELICANE.
With me? and welcome: happy day, my lords.
FIRST LORD.
Know that our griefs are risen to the top,
And now at length they overflow their banks.
HELICANE.
Your griefs! for what? wrong not your prince your love.
FIRST LORD.
Wrong not yourself, then, noble Helicane;
But if the prince do live, let us salute him.
Or know what ground's made happy by his breath.
If in the world he live, we'll seek him there;
And be resolved he lives to govern us,
Or dead, give's cause to mourn his funeral,
And leave us to our free election.
SECOND LORD.
Whose death indeed 's the strongest in our censure:
And knowing this kingdom is without a head, --
Like goodly buildings left without a roof
Soon fall to ruin, -- your noble self,
That best know how to rulle and how to reign,
We thus submit unto, -- our sovereign.
ALL.
Live, noble Helicane!
HELICANUS.
For honour's cause, forbear your suffrages:
If that you love Prince Pericles, forbear.
Take I your wish, I leap into the seas,
Where's hourly trouble for a minute's ease.
A twelve month longer, let me entreat you to
Forbear the absence of your king;
If in which time expired, he not return,
I shall with aged patience bear your yoke.
But if I cannot win you to this love,
Go search like nobles, like noble subjects,
And in your search spend your adventurous worth;
Whom if you find, and win unto return,
You shall like diamonds sit about his crown.
FIRST LORD.
To wisdom he's a fool that will not yield;
And since Lord Helicane enjoineth us,
We with our travels will endeavour us.
HELICANUS.
Then you love us, we you, and we'll clasp hands:
When peers thus knit, a kingdom ever stands.
[Exeunt.]
SCENE V. Pentapolis. A room in the palace.
Enter Simonides, reading a letter at one door: the Knights meet
him.]
FIRST KNIGHT.]
Good morrow to the good Simonides.
SIMONIDES.
Knights, from my daughter this I let you know,
That for this twelvemonth she'll not undertake
A married life.
Her reason to herself is only known,
Which yet from her by no means can I get.
SECOND KNIGHT.
May we not get access to her, my lord?
SIMONIDES.
'Faith, by no means; she hath so strictly tied
Her to her chamber, that 'tis impossible.
One twelve moons more she'll wear Diana's livery;
This by the eye of Cynthia hath she vow'd,
And on her virgin honour will not break it.
