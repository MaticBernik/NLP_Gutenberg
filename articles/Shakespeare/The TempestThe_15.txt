_Ste._ Prithee, do not turn me about; my stomach is not
constant.
_Cal._ [_aside_] These be fine things, an if they be not sprites.
That's a brave god, and bears celestial liquor:
I will kneel to him.                                               110
_Ste._ How didst thou 'scape? How camest thou hither?
swear, by this bottle, how thou camest hither. I escaped
upon a butt of sack, which the sailors heaved o'erboard, by
this bottle! which I made of the bark of a tree with mine
own hands, since I was cast ashore.                                115
_Cal._ I'll swear, upon that bottle, to be thy true subject;
for the liquor is not earthly.
_Ste._ Here; swear, then, how thou escapedst.
_Trin._ Swum ashore, man, like a duck: I can swim
like a duck, I'll be sworn.                                        120
_Ste._ Here, kiss the book. Though thou canst swim
like a duck, thou art made like a goose.
_Trin._ O Stephano, hast any more of this?
_Ste._ The whole butt, man: my cellar is in a rock by
the sea-side, where my wine is hid. How now, moon-calf!            125
how does thine ague?
_Cal._ Hast thou not dropp'd from heaven?
_Ste._ Out o' the moon, I do assure thee: I was the man
i' the moon when time was.
_Cal._ I have seen thee in her, and I do adore thee:               130
My mistress show'd me thee, and thy dog, and thy bush.
_Ste._ Come, swear to that; kiss the book: I will furnish
it anon with new contents: swear.
_Trin._ By this good light, this is a very shallow monster!
I afeard of him! A very weak monster! The                          135
man i' the moon! A most poor credulous monster! Well
drawn, monster, in good sooth!
_Cal._ I'll show thee every fertile inch o' th' island;
And I will kiss thy foot: I prithee, be my god.
_Trin._ By this light, a most perfidious and drunken               140
monster! when's god's asleep, he'll rob his bottle.
_Cal._ I'll kiss thy foot; I'll swear myself thy subject.
_Ste._ Come on, then; down, and swear.
_Trin._ I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed
monster. A most scurvy monster! I could find in                    145
my heart to beat him,--
_Ste._ Come, kiss.
_Trin._ But that the poor monster's in drink: an abominable
monster!
_Cal._ I'll show thee the best springs; I'll pluck thee berries;   150
I'll fish for thee, and get thee wood enough.
A plague upon the tyrant that I serve!
I'll bear him no more sticks, but follow thee,
Thou wondrous man.
_Trin._ A most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder                155
of a poor drunkard!
_Cal._ I prithee, let me bring thee where crabs grow;
And I with my long nails will dig thee pig-nuts;
Show thee a jay's nest, and instruct thee how
To snare the nimble marmoset; I'll bring thee                      160
To clustering filberts, and sometimes I'll get thee
Young scamels from the rock. Wilt thou go with me?
_Ste._ I prithee now, lead the way, without any more
talking. Trinculo, the king and all our company else being
drowned, we will inherit here: here; bear my bottle: fellow        165
Trinculo, we'll fill him by and by again.
