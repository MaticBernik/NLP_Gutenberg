_Fal._ But what says she to me? be brief, my good she-Mercury.
_Quick._ Marry, she hath received your letter; for the
which she thanks you a thousand times; and she gives you            75
to notify, that her husband will be absence from his house
between ten and eleven.
_Fal._ Ten and eleven.
_Quick._ Ay, forsooth; and then you may come and see
the picture, she says, that you wot of: Master Ford, her            80
husband, will be from home. Alas, the sweet woman leads
an ill life with him! he's a very jealousy man: she leads a
very frampold life with him, good heart.
_Fal._ Ten and eleven. Woman, commend me to her;
I will not fail her.                                                85
_Quick._ Why, you say well. But I have another messenger
to your worship. Mistress Page hath her hearty
commendations to you, too: and let me tell you in your
ear, she's as fartuous a civil modest wife, and one, I tell
you, that will not miss you morning nor evening prayer, as          90
any is in Windsor, whoe'er be the other: and she bade me
tell your worship that her husband is seldom from home;
but, she hopes, there will come a time. I never knew a
woman so dote upon a man: surely, I think you have
charms, la; yes, in truth.                                          95
_Fal._ Not I, I assure thee: setting the attraction of my
good parts aside, I have no other charms.
_Quick._ Blessing on your heart for't!
_Fal._ But, I pray thee, tell me this: has Ford's wife
and Page's wife acquainted each other how they love me?            100
_Quick._ That were a jest indeed! they have not so
little grace, I hope: that were a trick indeed! But Mistress
Page would desire you to send her your little page,
of all loves: her husband has a marvellous infection to the
little page; and, truly, Master Page is an honest man.             105
Never a wife in Windsor leads a better life than she does:
do what she will, say what she will, take all, pay all, go to
bed when she list, rise when she list, all is as she will: and,
truly, she deserves it; for if there be a kind woman in
Windsor, she is one. You must send her your page; no               110
remedy.
_Fal._ Why, I will.
_Quick._ Nay, but do so, then: and, look you, he may
come and go between you both; and, in any case, have a
nay-word, that you may know one another's mind, and                115
the boy never need to understand any thing; for 'tis not
good that children should know any wickedness: old folks,
you know, have discretion, as they say, and know the world.
_Fal._ Fare thee well: commend me to them both:
there's my purse; I am yet thy debtor. Boy, go along               120
with this woman. [_Exeunt Mistress Quickly and Robin._]
This news distracts me!
_Pist._ This punk is one of Cupid's carriers:
Clap on more sails; pursue; up with your fights:
Give fire: she is my prize, or ocean whelm them all! [_Exit._      125
