_Caius._ Rugby, come to the court with me. By gar, if              110
I have not Anne Page, I shall turn your head out of my
door. Follow my heels, Rugby.    [_Exeunt Caius and Rugby._
_Quick._ You shall have An fool's-head of your own.
No, I know Anne's mind for that: never a woman in
Windsor knows more of Anne's mind than I do; nor can               115
do more than I do with her, I thank heaven.
_Fent._ [_Within_] Who's within there? ho!
_Quick._ Who's there, I trow? Come near the house, I
pray you.
  _Enter FENTON._
_Fent._ How now, good woman! how dost thou?                        120
_Quick._ The better that it pleases your good worship
to ask.
_Fen._ What news? how does pretty Mistress Anne?
_Quick._ In truth, sir, and she is pretty, and honest, and
gentle; and one that is your friend, I can tell you that by        125
the way; I praise heaven for it.
_Fent._ Shall I do any good, thinkest thou? shall I not
lose my suit?
_Quick._ Troth, sir, all is in his hands above: but notwithstanding,
Master Fenton, I'll be sworn on a book, she                        130
loves you. Have not your worship a wart above your eye?
_Fent._ Yes, marry, have I; what of that?
_Quick._ Well, thereby hangs a tale:--good faith, it is
such another Nan; but, I detest, an honest maid as ever
broke bread:--we had an hour's talk of that wart. --I shall        135
never laugh but in that maid's company!--But, indeed, she
is given too much to allicholy and musing: but for you--well,
go to.
_Fent._ Well, I shall see her to-day. Hold, there's
money for thee; let me have thy voice in my behalf:                140
if thou seest her before me, commend me.
_Quick._ Will I? i' faith, that we will; and I will tell
your worship more of the wart the next time we have
confidence; and of other wooers.
_Fent._ Well, farewell; I am in great haste now.                   145
_Quick._ Farewell to your worship. [_Exit Fenton._] Truly,
an honest gentleman: but Anne loves him not; for I know
Anne's mind as well as another does. --Out upon't! what
have I forgot?    [_Exit._
