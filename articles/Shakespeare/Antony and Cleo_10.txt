AGRIPPA.
Rare Egyptian!
ENOBARBUS.
Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,
Invited her to supper: she replied
It should be better he became her guest;
Which she entreated: our courteous Antony,
Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak,
Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast,
And, for his ordinary, pays his heart
For what his eyes eat only.
AGRIPPA.
Royal wench!
She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed:
He ploughed her, and she cropp'd.
ENOBARBUS.
I saw her once
Hop forty paces through the public street;
And, having lost her breath, she spoke and panted,
That she did make defect perfection,
And, breathless, power breathe forth.
MAECENAS.
Now Antony must leave her utterly.
ENOBARBUS.
Never; he will not:
Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale
Her infinite variety: other women cloy
The appetites they feed; but she makes hungry
Where most she satisfies: for vilest things
Become themselves in her; that the holy priests
Bless her when she is riggish.
MAECENAS.
If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle
The heart of Antony, Octavia is
A blessed lottery to him.
AGRIPPA.
Let us go.--
Good Enobarbus, make yourself my guest
Whilst you abide here.
ENOBARBUS.
Humbly, sir, I thank you.
[Exeunt.]
SCENE III. Rome. A Room in CAESAR'S House.
[Enter CAESAR, ANTONY, OCTAVIA between them, and Attendants.]
ANTONY.
The world and my great office will sometimes
Divide me from your bosom.
OCTAVIA.
All which time
Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers
To them for you.
ANTONY.
Good night, sir.--My Octavia,
Read not my blemishes in the world's report:
I have not kept my square; but that to come
Shall all be done by the rule. Good night, dear lady.--
OCTAVIA.
Good night, sir.
CAESAR.
Good night.
[Exeunt CAESAR and OCTAVIA.]
[Enter SOOTHSAYER.]
ANTONY.
Now, sirrah, you do wish yourself in Egypt?
SOOTHSAYER.
Would I had never come from thence, nor you
Thither!
ANTONY.
If you can, your reason.
SOOTHSAYER.
I see it in my motion, have it not in my tongue; but yet
Hie you to Egypt again.
ANTONY.
Say to me,
Whose fortunes shall rise higher, Caesar's or mine?
SOOTHSAYER.
Caesar's.
Therefore, O Antony, stay not by his side:
Thy demon, that thy spirit which keeps thee, is
Noble, courageous, high, unmatchable,
Where Caesar's is not; but near him thy angel
Becomes a fear, as being o'erpower'd: therefore
Make space enough between you.
ANTONY.
Speak this no more.
SOOTHSAYER.
To none but thee; no more but when to thee.
If thou dost play with him at any game,
Thou art sure to lose; and of that natural luck
He beats thee 'gainst the odds: thy lustre thickens
When he shines by: I say again, thy spirit
Is all afraid to govern thee near him;
But, he away, 'tis noble.
ANTONY.
Get thee gone:
Say to Ventidius I would speak with him:--
[Exit SOOTHSAYER.]
He shall to Parthia.--Be it art or hap,
He hath spoken true: the very dice obey him;--
And in our sports my better cunning faints
Under his chance: if we draw lots, he speeds;
His cocks do win the battle still of mine,
When it is all to nought; and his quails ever
Beat mine, inhoop'd, at odds. I will to Egypt:
And though I make this marriage for my peace,
I' the East my pleasure lies.
