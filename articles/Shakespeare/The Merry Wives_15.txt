_Ford._ I would you knew Ford, sir, that you might
avoid him, if you saw him.
_Fal._ Hang him, mechanical salt-butter rogue! I will
stare him out of his wits; I will awe him with my cudgel:          250
it shall hang like a meteor o'er the cuckold's horns. Master
Brook, thou shalt know I will predominate over the
peasant, and thou shalt lie with his wife. --Come to me
soon at night. Ford's a knave, and I will aggravate his
style; thou, Master Brook, shalt know him for knave and            255
cuckold. Come to me soon at night.      [_Exit._
_Ford._ What a damned Epicurean rascal is this! My
heart is ready to crack with impatience. Who says this is
improvident jealousy? my wife hath sent to him; the hour
is fixed; the match is made. Would any man have thought            260
this? See the hell of having a false woman! My bed
shall be abused, my coffers ransacked, my reputation gnawn
at; and I shall not only receive this villanous wrong, but
stand under the adoption of abominable terms, and by him
that does me this wrong. Terms! names!--Amaimon                    265
sounds well; Lucifer, well; Barbason, well; yet they are
devils' additions, the names of fiends: but Cuckold!
Wittol!--Cuckold! the devil himself hath not such a name. Page
is an ass, a secure ass: he will trust his wife; he will not
be jealous. I will rather trust a Fleming with my butter,          270
Parson Hugh the Welshman with my cheese, an Irishman
with my aqua-vitae bottle, or a thief to walk my ambling
gelding, than my wife with herself: then she plots, then
she ruminates, then she devises; and what they think in
their hearts they may effect, they will break their hearts         275
but they will effect. God be praised for my jealousy!--Eleven
o'clock the hour. I will prevent this, detect my
wife, be revenged on Falstaff, and laugh at Page. I will
about it; better three hours too soon than a minute too
late. Fie, fie, fie! cuckold! cuckold! cuckold!   [_Exit._         280
