_Ant. S._ Go hie thee presently, post to the road:--               145
An if the wind blow any way from shore,
I will not harbour in this town to-night:--
If any bark put forth, come to the mart,
Where I will walk till thou return to me.
If every one knows us, and we know none,                           150
'Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack, and be gone.
_Dro. S._ As from a bear a man would run for life,
So fly I from her that would be my wife.    [_Exit._
_Ant. S._ There's none but witches do inhabit here;
And therefore 'tis high time that I were hence.                    155
She that doth call me husband, even my soul
Doth for a wife abhor. But her fair sister,
Possess'd with such a gentle sovereign grace,
Of such enchanting presence and discourse,
Hath almost made me traitor to myself:                             160
But, lest myself be guilty to self-wrong,
I'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song.
  _Enter ANGELO with the chain._
_Ang._ Master Antipholus,--
_Ant. S._                  Ay, that's my name.
_Ang._ I know it well, sir:--lo, here is the chain.
I thought to have ta'en you at the Porpentine:                     165
The chain unfinish'd made me stay thus long.
_Ant. S._ What is your will that I shall do with this?
_Ang._ What please yourself, sir: I have made it for you.
_Ant. S._ Made it for me, sir! I bespoke it not.
_Ang._ Not once, nor twice, but twenty times you have.             170
Go home with it, and please your wife withal;
And soon at supper-time I'll visit you,
And then receive my money for the chain.
_Ant. S._ I pray you, sir, receive the money now,
For fear you ne'er see chain nor money more.                       175
_Ang._ You are a merry man, sir: fare you well.    [_Exit._
_Ant. S._ What I should think of this, I cannot tell:
But this I think, there's no man is so vain
That would refuse so fair an offer'd chain.
I see a man here needs not live by shifts,                         180
When in the streets he meets such golden gifts.
I'll to the mart, and there for Dromio stay:
If any ship put out, then straight away.    [_Exit._
