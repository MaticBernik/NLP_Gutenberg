_Sal_. I would she were as lying a gossip in that, as ever knapp'd
ginger,[79] or made her neighbours believe she wept for the death of a
third husband: But it is true, that the good Antonio, the honest
Antonio,--O, that I had a title good enough to keep his name company!--
_Salar_. Come, the full stop.
_Sal_. Why, the end is, he hath lost a ship.
_Salar_. I would it might prove the end of his losses!
_Sal_. Let me say amen betimes, lest the devil cross my prayer; for here
he comes in the likeness of a Jew.
_Enter_ SHYLOCK.
_Salar_. How now, Shylock? what news among the merchants?
_Shy_. You knew, none so well, none so well as you, of my daughter's
flight?
_Sal_. That's certain. I, for my part, knew the tailor that made the
wings she flew withal.
_Salar_. And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was fledg'd; and
then it is the complexion of them all to leave the dam.
_Shy_. She is damn'd for it.
_Sal_. That's certain, if the devil may be her judge.
_Shy_. My own flesh and blood to rebel!
_Salar_. But tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had any loss at
sea or no?
_Shy_. There I have another bad match: a bankrupt, a prodigal, who dare
scarce show his head on the Rialto; a beggar, that used to come so smug
upon the mart.--Let him look to his bond: he was wont to call me
usurer;--let him look to his bond: he was wont to lend money for a
Christian courtesy;--let him look to his bond.
_Sal_. Why, I am sure, if he forfeit, thou wilt not take his flesh?
What's that good for?
_Shy_. To bait fish withal: if it will feed nothing else it will feed my
revenge. He hath disgraced me, and hindered me half a million; laughed
at my losses, mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my
bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine enemies: and what's his reason?
I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew hands, organs,
dimensions, senses, affections, passions? fed with the same food, hurt
with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same
means, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as a Christian
is? If you prick us, do we not bleed? if you tickle us, do we not laugh?
if you poison us, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall we not
revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in that.
If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility? revenge: If a
Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian
example? why, revenge. The villany you teach me I will execute: and it
shall go hard but I will better the instruction.
_Salar_. Here comes another of the tribe; a third cannot be matched,
unless the devil himself turn Jew.
