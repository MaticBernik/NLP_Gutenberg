[Trumpet sounds. Enter a MESSENGER.]
TIMON.
What trumpet's that?
MESSENGER.
'Tis Alcibiades, and some twenty horse,
All of companionship.
TIMON.
Pray entertain them; give them guide to us.
[Exeunt some attendants.]
You must needs dine with me. Go not you hence
Till I have thank'd you; when dinner's done,
Show me this piece. I am joyful of your sights.
[Enter ALCIBIADES, with the his Company.]
Most welcome, sir!
[They salute.]
APEMANTUS.
So, so, there!
Aches contract and starve your supple joints!
That there should be small love 'mongst these sweet knaves,
And all this courtesy! The strain of man's bred out
Into baboon and monkey.
ALCIBIADES.
Sir, you have sav'd my longing, and I feed
Most hungerly on your sight.
TIMON.
Right welcome, sir!
Ere we depart we'll share a bounteous time
In different pleasures. Pray you, let us in.
[Exeunt all but APEMANTUS.]
[Enter two LORDS.]
FIRST LORD.
What time o' day is't, Apemantus?
APEMANTUS.
Time to be honest.
FIRST LORD.
That time serves still.
APEMANTUS.
The more accursed thou that still omitt'st it.
SECOND LORD.
Thou art going to Lord Timon's feast.
APEMANTUS.
Ay; to see meat fill knaves and wine heat fools.
SECOND LORD.
Fare thee well, fare thee well.
APEMANTUS.
Thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice.
SECOND LORD.
Why, Apemantus?
APEMANTUS.
Shouldst have kept one to thyself, for I mean to give thee none.
FIRST LORD.
Hang thyself!
APEMANTUS.
No, I will do nothing at thy bidding: make thy requests to thy
friend.
SECOND LORD.
Away, unpeaceable dog! or I'll spurn thee hence.
APEMANTUS.
I will fly, like a dog, the heels of an ass.
[Exit.]
FIRST LORD.
He's opposite to humanity. Come, shall we in,
And taste Lord Timon's bounty? he outgoes
The very heart of kindness.
SECOND LORD.
He pours it out; Plutus, the god of gold,
Is but his steward: no meed but he repays
Sevenfold above itself; no gift to him
But breeds the giver a return exceeding
All use of quittance.
FIRST LORD.
The noblest mind he carries
That ever govern'd man.
SECOND LORD.
Long may he live in fortunes! Shall we in?
FIRST LORD.
I'll keep you company.
[Exeunt.]
Scene II.-- The Same. A room of state in TIMON'S House.
[Hautboys playing loud music. A great banquet served in;
FLAVIUS and Others attending: then enter LORD TIMON, ALCIBIADES,
Lords, and Senators, VENTIDIUS and Attendants. Then comes,
dropping after all, APEMANTUS, discontentedly, like himself.]
VENTIDIUS.
Most honour'd Timon,
It hath pleas'd the gods to remember my father's age,
And call him to long peace.
He is gone happy, and has left me rich:
Then, as in grateful virtue I am bound
To your free heart, I do return those talents,
Doubled with thanks and service, from whose help
I deriv'd liberty.
TIMON.
O! by no means,
Honest Ventidius: you mistake my love;
I gave it freely ever; and there's none
Can truly say he gives, if he receives:
If our betters play at that game, we must not dare
To imitate them; faults that are rich are fair.
