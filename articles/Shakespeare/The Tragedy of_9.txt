BRUTUS.
Good or bad?
MENENIUS.
Not according to the prayer of the people, for they love not
Marcius.
SICINIUS.
Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.
MENENIUS.
Pray you, who does the wolf love?
SICINIUS.
The lamb.
MENENIUS.
Ay, to devour him, as the hungry plebeians would the noble
Marcius.
BRUTUS.
He's a lamb indeed, that baas like a bear.
MENENIUS.
He's a bear indeed, that lives like a lamb. You two are old men:
tell me one thing that I shall ask you.
BOTH TRIBUNES.
Well, sir.
MENENIUS.
In what enormity is Marcius poor in, that you two have not
in abundance?
BRUTUS.
He's poor in no one fault, but stored with all.
SICINIUS.
Especially in pride.
BRUTUS.
And topping all others in boasting.
MENENIUS.
This is strange now: do you two know how you are censured here in
the city, I mean of us o' the right-hand file? Do you?
BOTH TRIBUNES.
Why, how are we censured?
MENENIUS.
Because you talk of pride now,--will you not be angry?
BOTH TRIBUNES.
Well, well, sir, well.
MENENIUS.
Why, 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief of occasion
will rob you of a great deal of patience: give your dispositions
the reins, and be angry at your pleasures; at the least, if you
take it as a pleasure to you in being so. You blame Marcius for
being proud?
BRUTUS.
We do it not alone, sir.
MENENIUS.
I know you can do very little alone; for your helps are many, or
else your actions would grow wondrous single: your abilities are
too infant-like for doing much alone. You talk of pride: O that
you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks, and make
but an interior survey of your good selves! O that you could!
BOTH TRIBUNES.
What then, sir?
MENENIUS.
Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting, proud,
violent, testy magistrates,--alias fools,--as any in Rome.
SICINIUS.
Menenius, you are known well enough too.
MENENIUS.
I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that loves a cup
of hot wine with not a drop of allaying Tiber in't; said to
be something imperfect in favouring the first complaint, hasty
and tinder-like upon too trivial motion; one that converses more
with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the
morning. What I think I utter, and spend my malice in my breath.
Meeting two such wealsmen as you are,--I cannot call you
Lycurguses,--if the drink you give me touch my palate adversely,
I make a crooked face at it. I cannot say your worships have
delivered the matter well when I find the ass in compound with
the major part of your syllables; and though I must be content to
bear with those that say you are reverend grave men, yet they lie
deadly that tell you have good faces. If you see this in the map
of my microcosm, follows it that I am known well enough too? What
harm can your bisson conspectuities glean out of this character,
if I be known well enough too?
