[Enter a Beadle with whips.]
GLOSTER.
Well, sir, we must have you find your legs.--
Sirrah beadle, whip him till he leap over that same stool.
BEADLE.
I will, my lord.--Come on, sirrah; off with your doublet
quickly.
SIMPCOX.
Alas, master, what shall I do? I am not able to stand.
[After the Beadle hath hit him once, he leaps over
the stool and runs away; and they follow and cry,
'A miracle!']
KING.
O God, seest Thou this, and bearest so long?
QUEEN.
It made me laugh to see the villain run.
GLOSTER.
Follow the knave, and take this drab away.
WIFE.
Alas, sir, we did it for pure need!
GLOSTER.
Let them be whipped through every market-town
till they come to Berwick, from whence they came.
[Exeunt Wife, Beadle, Mayor, etc.]
CARDINAL.
Duke Humphrey has done a miracle to-day.
SUFFOLK.
True; made the lame to leap and fly away.
GLOSTER.
But you have done more miracles than I;
You made in a day, my lord, whole towns to fly.
[Enter BUCKINGHAM.]
KING.
What tidings with our cousin Buckingham?
BUCKINGHAM.
Such as my heart doth tremble to unfold.
A sort of naughty persons, lewdly bent,
Under the countenance and confederacy
Of Lady Eleanor, the protector's wife,
The ringleader and head of all this rout,
Have practis'd dangerously against your state,
Dealing with witches and with conjurers,
Whom we have apprehended in the fact,
Raising up wicked spirits from underground,
Demanding of King Henry's life and death,
And other of your highness' privy-council,
As more at large your Grace shall understand.
CARDINAL.
[Aside to Gloster.] And so, my lord protector,
by this means
Your lady is forthcoming yet at London.
This news, I think, hath turn'd your weapon's edge;
'T is like, my lord, you will not keep your hour.
GLOSTER.
Ambitious churchman, leave to afflict my heart.
Sorrow and grief have vanquish'd all my powers;
And, vanquish'd as I am, I yield to thee,
Or to the meanest groom.
KING.
O God, what mischiefs work the wicked ones,
Heaping confusion on their own heads thereby!
QUEEN.
Gloster, see here the tainture of thy nest;
And look thyself be faultless, thou wert best.
GLOSTER.
Madam, for myself, to heaven I do appeal,
How I have lov'd my king and commonweal;
And, for my wife, I know not how it stands.
Sorry I am to hear what I have heard;
Noble she is; but if she have forgot
Honour and virtue, and convers'd with such
As like to pitch defile nobility,
I banish her my bed and company,
And give her as a prey to law and shame,
That hath dishonoured Gloster's honest name.
KING.
Well, for this night we will repose us here;
To-morrow toward London back again,
To look into this business thoroughly,
And call these foul offenders to their answers,
And poise the cause in justice' equal scales,
Whose beam stands sure, whose rightful cause prevails.
[Flourish. Exeunt.]
SCENE II. London. The Duke of York's Garden.
[Enter YORK, SALISBURY, and WARWICK.]
