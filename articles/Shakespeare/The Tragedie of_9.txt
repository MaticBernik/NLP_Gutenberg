[Footnote 4: _1st Q._ 'O my good friend, I change, &c.' This would leave
it doubtful whether he wished to exchange servant or friend; but 'Sir,
my _good friend_,' correcting Horatio, makes his intent plain.]
[Footnote 5: Emphasis on _that_: 'I will exchange the name of _friend_
with you.']
[Footnote 6: 'What are you doing from--out of, _away
from_--Wittenberg?']
[Footnote 7: In recognition: the word belongs to Hamlet's speech.]
[Footnote 8: _Point thus_: 'you.--Good even, sir.'--_to Barnardo, whom
he does not know._]
[Footnote 9: An ungrammatical reply. He does not wish to give the real,
painful answer, and so replies confusedly, as if he had been asked,
'What makes you?' instead of, 'What do you make?']
[Footnote 10: '--I should know how to answer him.']
[Footnote 11: Emphasis on _you_.]
[Footnote 12: Said with contempt for his surroundings.]

_Hor._ Indeed my Lord, it followed hard vpon.
_Ham._ Thrift, thrift _Horatio_: the Funerall Bakt-meats
Did coldly furnish forth the Marriage Tables;
Would I had met my dearest foe in heauen,[1]
Ere I had euer seerie that day _Horatio_.[2]   [Sidenote: Or ever I had]
My father, me thinkes I see my father.
_Hor._ Oh where my Lord?                            [Sidenote: Where my]
_Ham._ In my minds eye (_Horatio_)[3]
_Hor._ I saw him once; he was a goodly King.     [Sidenote: once, a was]
_Ham._ He was a man, take him for all in all:    [Sidenote: A was a man]
I shall not look vpon his like againe.
_Hor._ My Lord, I thinke I saw him yesternight.
_Ham._ Saw? Who?[4]
_Hor._ My Lord, the King your Father.
_Ham._ The King my Father?[5]
_Hor._ Season[6] your admiration for a while
With an attent eare;[7] till I may deliuer
Vpon the witnesse of these Gentlemen,
This maruell to you.
_Ham._ For Heauens loue let me heare.             [Sidenote: God's love]
_Hor._ Two nights together, had these Gentlemen
(_Marcellus_ and _Barnardo_) on their Watch
In the dead wast and middle of the night[8]
Beene thus encountred. A figure like your Father,[9]
Arm'd at all points exactly, _Cap a Pe_,[10]  [Sidenote: Armed at poynt]
Appeares before them, and with sollemne march
Goes slow and stately: By them thrice he walkt,
                                     [Sidenote: stately by them; thrice]
By their opprest and feare-surprized eyes,
Within his Truncheons length; whilst they bestil'd
                                          [Sidenote: they distill'd[11]]
Almost to Ielly with the Act of feare,[12]
Stand dumbe and speake not to him. This to me
In dreadfull[13] secrecie impart they did,
And I with them the third Night kept the Watch,
Whereas[14] they had deliuer'd both in time,
[Footnote 1: _Dear_ is not unfrequently used as an intensive; but 'my
dearest foe' is not 'the man who hates me most,' but 'the man whom most
I regard as my foe.']
[Footnote 2: Note Hamlet's trouble: the marriage, not the death, nor the
supplantation.]
[Footnote 3: --with a little surprise at Horatio's question.]
[Footnote 4: Said as if he must have misheard. Astonishment comes only
with the next speech.]
[Footnote 5: _1st Q_. 'Ha, ha, the King my father ke you.']
