_Pom._ Yonder man is carried to prison.
_Mrs Ov._ Well; what has he done?
_Pom._ A woman.
_Mrs Ov._ But what's his offence?                                   85
_Pom._ Groping for trouts in a peculiar river.
_Mrs Ov._ What, is there a maid with child by him?
_Pom._ No, but there's a woman with maid by him.
You have not heard of the proclamation, have you?
_Mrs Ov._ What proclamation, man?                                   90
_Pom._ All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be
plucked down.
_Mrs Ov._ And what shall become of those in the city?
_Pom._ They shall stand for seed: they had gone down
too, but that a wise burgher put in for them.                       95
_Mrs Ov._ But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs
be pulled down?
_Pom._ To the ground, mistress.
_Mrs Ov._ Why, here's a change indeed in the commonwealth!
What shall become of me?                                           100
_Pom._ Come; fear not you: good counsellors lack no
clients: though you change your place, you need not
change your trade; I'll be your tapster still. Courage!
there will be pity taken on you: you that have worn your
eyes almost out in the service, you will be considered.            105
_Mrs Ov._ What's to do here, Thomas tapster? let's
withdraw.
_Pom._ Here comes Signior Claudio, led by the provost
to prison; and there's Madam Juliet.    [_Exeunt._
  _Enter PROVOST, CLAUDIO, JULIET, and _Officers_._
_Claud._ Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to the world?          110
Bear me to prison, where I am committed.
_Prov._ I do it not in evil disposition,
But from Lord Angelo by special charge.
_Claud._ Thus can the demigod Authority
Make us pay down for our offence by weight                         115
The words of heaven;--on whom it will, it will;
On whom it will not, so; yet still 'tis just.
  _Re-enter LUCIO and two _Gentlemen_._
_Lucio._ Why, how now, Claudio! whence comes this restraint?
_Claud._ From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty:
As surfeit is the father of much fast,                             120
So every scope by the immoderate use
Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,
Like rats that ravin down their proper bane,
A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.
_Lucio._ If I could speak so wisely under an arrest, I             125
would send for certain of my creditors: and yet, to say the
truth, I had as lief have the foppery of freedom as the
morality of imprisonment. What's thy offence, Claudio?
_Claud._ What but to speak of would offend again.
_Lucio._ What, is't murder?                                        130
_Claud._ No.
_Lucio._ Lechery?
_Claud._ Call it so.
_Prov._ Away, sir! you must go.
_Claud._ One word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you.            135
_Lucio._ A hundred, if they'll do you any good.
Is lechery so look'd after?
_Claud._ Thus stands it with me:--upon a true contract
I got possession of Julietta's bed:
You know the lady; she is fast my wife,                            140
Save that we do the denunciation lack
Of outward order: this we came not to,
Only for propagation of a dower
Remaining in the coffer of her friends;
From whom we thought it meet to hide our love                      145
Till time had made them for us. But it chances
The stealth of our most mutual entertainment
With character too gross is writ on Juliet.
