AMIENS.
Well, I'll end the song.--Sirs, cover the while: the duke will
drink under this tree:--he hath been all this day to look you.
JAQUES.
And I have been all this day to avoid him. He is too
disputable for my company: I think of as many matters as he;
but I give heaven thanks, and make no boast of them. Come,
warble, come.
      SONG
[All together here.]
    Who doth ambition shun,
    And loves to live i' the sun,
    Seeking the food he eats,
    And pleas'd with what he gets,
 Come hither, come hither, come hither.
    Here shall he see
    No enemy
 But winter and rough weather.
JAQUES.
I'll give you a verse to this note that I made
yesterday in despite of my invention.
AMIENS.
And I'll sing it.
JAQUES.
Thus it goes:
    If it do come to pass
    That any man turn ass,
    Leaving his wealth and ease
    A stubborn will to please,
 Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame;
    Here shall he see
    Gross fools as he,
 An if he will come to me.
AMIENS.
What's that "ducdame?"
JAQUES.
'Tis a Greek invocation, to call fools into a circle. I'll
go sleep, if I can; if I cannot, I'll rail against all the
first-born of Egypt.
AMIENS.
And I'll go seek the duke; his banquet is prepared.
[Exeunt severally.]
SCENE VI. Another part of the Forest.
[Enter ORLANDO and ADAM.]
ADAM.
Dear master, I can go no further: O, I die for food! Here
lie I down, and measure out my grave. Farewell, kind master.
ORLANDO.
Why, how now, Adam! no greater heart in thee? Live a
little; comfort a little; cheer thyself a little. If this uncouth
forest yield anything savage, I will either be food for it or
bring it for food to thee. Thy conceit is nearer death than thy
powers. For my sake be comfortable: hold death awhile at the
arm's end: I will here be with thee presently; and if I bring
thee not something to eat, I'll give thee leave to die: but if
thou diest before I come, thou art a mocker of my labour. Well
said! thou look'st cheerily: and I'll be with thee quickly.--Yet
thou liest in the bleak air: come, I will bear thee to some
shelter; and thou shalt not die for lack of a dinner if there
live anything in this desert. Cheerily, good Adam!
[Exeunt.]
SCENE VII. Another part of the Forest.
[A table set. Enter DUKE Senior, AMIENS, and others.]
DUKE SENIOR.
I think he be transform'd into a beast;
For I can nowhere find him like a man.
FIRST LORD.
My lord, he is but even now gone hence;
Here was he merry, hearing of a song.
DUKE SENIOR.
If he, compact of jars, grow musical,
We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.
Go, seek him; tell him I would speak with him.
FIRST LORD.
He saves my labour by his own approach.
[Enter JAQUES.]
DUKE SENIOR.
Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this,
That your poor friends must woo your company?
What! you look merrily!
