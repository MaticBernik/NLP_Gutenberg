_Enter a_ Servant.
                   Sirrah, lead these gentlemen
    To my daughters; and tell them both,
    These are their tutors: bid them use them well.
             [_Exit Servant, with Luc. and Hor., Bio. following._
    We will go walk a little in the orchard,                         110
    And then to dinner. You are passing welcome,
    And so I pray you all to think yourselves.
    _Pet._ Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste,
    And every day I cannot come to woo.
    You knew my father well, and in him me,                          115
    Left solely heir to all his lands and goods,
    Which I have better'd rather than decreased:
    Then tell me, if I get your daughter's love,
    What dowry shall I have with her to wife?
    _Bap._ After my death the one half of my lands,                  120
    And in possession twenty thousand crowns.
    _Pet._ And, for that dowry, I 'll assure her of
    Her widowhood, be it that she survive me,
    In all my lands and leases whatsoever:
    Let specialties be therefore drawn between us,                   125
    That covenants may be kept on either hand.
    _Bap._ Ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd,
    That is, her love; for that is all in all.
    _Pet._ Why, that is nothing; for I tell you, father,
    I am as peremptory as she proud-minded;                          130
    And where two raging fires meet together
    They do consume the thing that feeds their fury:
    Though little fire grows great with little wind,
    Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all:
    So I to her and so she yields to me;                             135
    For I am rough and woo not like a babe.
    _Bap._ Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed!
    But be thou arm'd for some unhappy words.
    _Pet._ Ay, to the proof; as mountains are for winds,
    That shake not, though they blow perpetually.                    140
_Re-enter_ HORTENSIO, _with his head broke_.
    _Bap._ How now, my friend! why dost thou look so pale?
    _Hor._ For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.
    _Bap._ What, will my daughter prove a good musician?
    _Hor._ I think she'll sooner prove a soldier:
    Iron may hold with her, but never lutes.                         145
    _Bap._ Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?
    _Hor._ Why, no; for she hath broke the lute to me.
    I did but tell her she mistook her frets,
    And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering;
    When, with a most impatient devilish spirit,                     150
    'Frets, call you these?' quoth she; 'I'll fume with them:'
    And, with that word, she struck me on the head,
    And through the instrument my pate made way;
    And there I stood amazed for a while,
    As on a pillory, looking through the lute;                       155
    While she did call me rascal fiddler
    And twangling Jack; with twenty such vile terms,
    As had she studied to misuse me so.
    _Pet._ Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench;
    I love her ten times more than e'er I did:                       160
    O, how I long to have some chat with her!
