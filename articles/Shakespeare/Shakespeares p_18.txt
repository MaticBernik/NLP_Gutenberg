[_Exeunt_ SALANIO, SALARINO, _and Servant_.
_Enter_ TUBAL.
_Shy_. How now, Tubal, what news from Genoa? hast thou found my
daughter?
_Tub_. I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her.
_Shy_. Why, there, there, there, there! a diamond gone, cost me two
thousand ducats in Frankfort! The curse never fell upon our nation till
now; I never felt it till now:--two thousand ducats in that; and other
precious, precious jewels.--I would my daughter were dead at my foot,
and the jewels in her ear! 'would she were hears'd at my foot, and the
ducats in her coffin! No news of them?--Why, so:--and I know not what's
spent in the search: Why, thou loss upon loss! the thief gone with so
much, and so much to find the thief; and no satisfaction, no revenge:
nor no ill luck stirring but what lights o' my shoulders; no sighs but
o' my breathing; no tears but o' my shedding.
_Tub_. Yes, other men have ill luck, too. Antonio, as I heard in
Genoa,--
_Shy_. What, what, what? ill luck, ill luck?
_Tub_. Hath an argosy cast away, coming from Tripolis.
_Shy_. I thank God, I thank God:--Is it true? is it true?
_Tub_. I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck.
_Shy_. I thank thee, good Tubal;--Good news, good news: ha! ha!--Where?
in Genoa?
_Tub_. Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, one night, fourscore
ducats!
_Shy_. Thou stick'st a dagger in me:--I shall never see my gold again:
Fourscore ducats at a sitting! fourscore ducats!
_Tub_. There came divers of Antonio's creditors in my company to Venice,
that swear he cannot choose but break.
_Shy_. I am very glad of it: I'll plague him; I'll torture him; I am
glad of it.
_Tub_. One of them showed me a ring, that he had of your daughter for a
monkey.
_Shy_. Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal: it was my turquoise;[80]
I had it of Leah, when I was a bachelor: I would not have given it for a
wilderness of monkeys.
_Tub_. But Antonio is certainly undone.
_Shy_. Nay, that's true, that's very true: Go, Tubal, fee me an officer,
bespeak him a fortnight before: I will have the heart of him, if he
forfeit; for were he out of Venice, I can make what merchandize I will.
Go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue: go, good Tubal; at our
synagogue, Tubal.
[_Exeunt_.
