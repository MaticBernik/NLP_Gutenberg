The Constable, Charles D'Albret, commanded the French army at the Battle
of Agincourt, and was slain on the field.
    _Enter CHORUS._
  _Chor._ Thus with imagin'd wing our swift scene flies,
  In motion of no less celerity
  Than that of thought. Suppose that you have seen
  The well-appointed king[1] at Hampton pier
  Embark his royalty;[2] and his brave fleet
  With silken streamers the young Phoebus fanning:
  Play with your fancies; and in them behold
  Upon the hempen tackle ship-boys climbing;
  Hear the shrill whistle, which doth order give
  To sounds confus'd; behold the threaden sails,
  Borne with the invisible and creeping wind,
  Draw the huge bottoms through the furrow'd sea,
  Breasting the lofty surge: O, do but think
  You stand upon the rivage,[3] and behold
  A city on the inconstant billows dancing;
  For so appears this fleet majestical,
  Holding due course to Harfleur. Follow, follow!
  Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy;[4]
  And leave your England, as dead midnight still,
  Guarded with grandsires, babies, and old women,
  Either past, or not arriv'd to, pith and puissance;
  For who is he, whose chin is but enrich'd
  With one appearing hair, that will not follow
  These cull'd and choice-drawn cavaliers to France?
  Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege;
  Behold the ordnance on their carriages,
  With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur.
  Suppose the ambassador from the French comes back;
  Tells Harry--that the king doth offer him
  Katharine his daughter; and with her, to dowry,
  Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms.
  The offer likes not: and the nimble gunner
  With linstock[5] now the devilish cannon touches,
    [_Alarums, and cannon shot off._
  And down goes all before them. Still be kind,
  And eke out our performance with your mind.
    [_Exit._
    [Footnote IIIc.1: _The well-appointed king_] i.e., well furnished
    with all the necessaries of war.]
    [Footnote IIIc.2: _Embark his royalty;_] The place where Henry's
    army was encamped, at Southampton, is now entirely covered with
    the sea, and called Westport.]
    [Footnote IIIc.3: _----rivage,_] The _bank_ or shore.]
    [Footnote IIIc.4: _----to +sternage+ of this navy;_] The stern
    being the hinder part of the ship, the meaning is, let your minds
    follow close after the navy. _Stern_, however, appears to have
    been anciently synonymous to _rudder_.]
  Scene Changes to
  THE SIEGE OF HARFLEUR.
  THE WALLS ARE MANNED BY THE FRENCH.
  The English Are Repulsed from
  an Attack on the Breach.
    _Alarums. Enter KING HENRY, EXETER, BEDFORD, GLOSTER, and
    Soldiers, R.H._
  _K. Hen._ Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;
  Or close the wall up with our English dead![6]
  In peace there's nothing so becomes a man
  As modest stillness and humility:
  But when the blast of war blows in our ears,
  Then imitate the action of the tiger!
  On, on, you noble English,
  Whose blood is fet[7] from fathers of war-proof!
  And you, good yeomen,
  Whose limbs were made in England, show us here
  The mettle of your pasture; let us swear
  That you are worth your breeding: which I doubt not;
  For there is none of you so mean and base,
  That hath not noble lustre in your eyes.
  I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,[8]
  Straining upon the start. The game's afoot:
  Follow your spirit; and, upon this charge,
  Cry--God for Harry! England! and Saint George!
