ACT III.
SCENE I. _A room in the prison._
  _Enter DUKE disguised as before, CLAUDIO, and PROVOST._
_Duke._ So, then, you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?
_Claud._ The miserable have no other medicine
But only hope:
I've hope to live, and am prepar'd to die.
_Duke._ Be absolute for death; either death or life                  5
Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life:
If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing
That none but fools would keep: a breath thou art,
Servile to all the skyey influences.
That dost this habitation, where thou keep'st,                      10
Hourly afflict: merely, thou art death's fool;
For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun,
And yet runn'st toward him still. Thou art not noble;
For all the accommodations that thou bear'st
Are nursed by baseness. Thou'rt by no means valiant;                15
For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,
And that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear'st
Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;
For thou exist'st on many a thousand grains                         20
That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;
For what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get.
And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain;
For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,
After the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor;                     25
For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,
Thou bear'st thy heavy riches but a journey,
And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;
For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,
The mere effusion of thy proper loins,                              30
Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,
For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age.
But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,
Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth
Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms                              35
Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,
Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,
To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this
That bears the name of life? Yet in this life
Lie hid more thousand deaths: yet death we fear,                    40
That makes these odds all even.
_Claud._                      I humbly thank you.
To sue to live, I find I seek to die;
And, seeking death, find life: let it come on.
_Isab._ [_within_] What, ho! Peace here; grace and good company!
_Prov._ Who's there? come in: the wish deserves a welcome.          45
_Duke._ Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.
_Claud._ Most holy sir, I thank you.
  _Enter ISABELLA._
_Isab._ My business is a word or two with Claudio.
_Prov._ And very welcome. Look, signior, here's your
sister.                                                             50
_Duke._ Provost, a word with you.
_Prov._ As many as you please.
_Duke._ Bring me to hear them speak, where I may be
concealed.    [_Exeunt Duke and Provost._
_Claud._ Now, sister, what's the comfort?                           55
_Isab._ Why,
As all comforts are; most good, most good indeed.
Lord Angelo, having affairs to heaven,
Intends you for his swift ambassador,
Where you shall be an everlasting leiger:                           60
Therefore your best appointment make with speed;
To-morrow you set on.
