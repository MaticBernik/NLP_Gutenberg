VIRGILIA.
His bloody brow! O Jupiter, no blood!
VOLUMNIA.
Away, you fool! It more becomes a man
Than gilt his trophy: the breasts of Hecuba,
When she did suckle Hector, looked not lovelier
Than Hector's forehead when it spit forth blood
At Grecian swords contending.--Tell Valeria
We are fit to bid her welcome.
[Exit GENTLEWOMAN.]
VIRGILIA.
Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!
VOLUMNIA.
He'll beat Aufidius' head below his knee,
And tread upon his neck.
[Re-enter GENTLEWOMAN, with VALERIA and her Usher.]
VALERIA.
My ladies both, good-day to you.
VOLUMNIA.
Sweet madam.
VIRGILIA.
I am glad to see your ladyship.
VALERIA.
How do you both? you are manifest housekeepers. What are
you sewing here? A fine spot, in good faith.--How does your
little son?
VIRGILIA.
I thank your ladyship; well, good madam.
VOLUMNIA.
He had rather see the swords and hear a drum than look upon his
schoolmaster.
VALERIA.
O' my word, the father's son: I'll swear 'tis a very pretty boy.
O' my troth, I looked upon him o' Wednesday,  half an hour
together: has such a confirmed countenance. I saw him run after a
gilded butterfly; and when he caught it he let it go again; and
after it again; and over and over he comes, and up again; catched
it again; or whether his fall enraged him, or how 'twas, he did
so set his teeth and tear it; O, I warrant, how he mammocked it!
VOLUMNIA.
One on's father's moods.
VALERIA.
Indeed, la, 'tis a noble child.
VIRGILIA.
A crack, madam.
VALERIA.
Come, lay aside your stitchery; I must have you play the idle
huswife with me this afternoon.
VIRGILIA.
No, good madam; I will not out of doors.
VALERIA.
Not out of doors!
VOLUMNIA.
She shall, she shall.
VIRGILIA.
Indeed, no, by your patience; I'll not over the threshold till my
lord return from the wars.
VALERIA.
Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably; come, you must go
visit the good lady that lies in.
VIRGILIA.
I will wish her speedy strength, and visit her with my prayers;
but I cannot go thither.
VOLUMNIA.
Why, I pray you?
VIRGILIA.
'Tis not to save labour, nor that I want love.
VALERIA.
You would be another Penelope; yet they say all the yarn she spun
in Ulysses' absence did but fill Ithaca full of moths. Come; I
would your cambric were sensible as your finger, that you might
leave pricking it for pity.--Come, you shall go with us.
VIRGILIA.
No, good madam, pardon me; indeed I will not forth.
VALERIA.
In truth, la, go with me; and I'll tell you excellent news
of your husband.
VIRGILIA.
O, good madam, there can be none yet.
VALERIA.
Verily, I do not jest with you; there came news from him last
night.
VIRGILIA.
Indeed, madam?
VALERIA.
In earnest, it's true; I heard a senator speak it. Thus it
is:--the Volsces have an army forth; against whom Cominius the
general is gone, with one part of our Roman power: your lord and
Titus Lartius are set down before their city Corioli; they
nothing doubt prevailing, and to make it brief wars. This is
true, on mine honour; and so, I pray, go with us.
