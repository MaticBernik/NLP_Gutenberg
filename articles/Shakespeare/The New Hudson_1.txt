THE SCENE OF THE ASSASSINATION
In transferring the assassination of Caesar from the _Porticus Pompeia_
("Pompey's porch," I, iii, 126) to the Capitol, Shakespeare departed
from Plutarch and historical accuracy to follow a popular tradition that
had received the signal imprimatur of Chaucer:
  This Iulius to the Capitolie wente
  Upon a day, as he was wont to goon,[1]
  And in the Capitolie anon him hente[2]
  This false Brutus, and his othere foon[3]
  And stikede him with boydekins[4] anoon
  With many a wounde, and thus they lete him lye;
  But never gronte[5] he at no strook but oon,
  Or elles at two, but if[6] his storie lye.
        _The Monkes Tale_, ll. 715-718. (Skeat's _Chaucer_.)
[Footnote 1: go.]
[Footnote 2: seized.]
[Footnote 3: foes.]
[Footnote 4: daggers.]
[Footnote 5: groaned.]
[Footnote 6: unless.]
This literary and popular tradition is followed in _Hamlet_, III, ii,
107-111:
  HAMLET. What did you enact?
  POLONIUS. I did enact Julius Caesar: I was kill'd i' the Capitol:
  Brutus kill'd me.
  HAMLET. It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there.
So also in _Antony and Cleopatra:_
                    Since Julius Caesar,
  Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted,
  There saw you labouring for him. What was 't
  That mov'd pale Cassius to conspire; and what
  Made the all-honour'd, honest Roman, Brutus,
  With the arm'd rest, courtiers of beauteous freedom,
  To drench the Capitol; but that they would
  Have one man but a man?      [II, vi, 12-19.]
We have the same popular tradition in the first scene of the last act of
Fletcher's _The Noble Gentleman_. So, too, in the Prologue to Beaumont
and Fletcher's, or Fletcher and Massinger's, _The False One_, a tragedy
dealing with Caesar and Cleopatra:
                          To tell
  Of Caesar's amorous heats, and how he fell
  I' the Capitol.
Here the reference is to Shakespeare's play.
"ET TU, BRUTE"
Dyce and other researchers have made clear that in Shakespeare's day
"_Et tu, Brute_" was a familiar phrase which had special reference to a
wound from a supposed friend. It probably owed its popularity to having
been used in the earlier plays on the subject of Julius Caesar. In _The
True Tragedie of Richard Duke of York_ (1595), upon which Shakespeare's
_3 Henry VI_ is based, occurs the line,
  _Et tu, Brute?_ wilt thou stab Caesar too?
This line is repeated in S. Nicholson's poem, _Acolastus, his
Afterwitte_ (1600). In Ben Jonson's _Every Man out of His Humour_
(1599), Buffone uses "_Et tu, Brute_" in speaking to Macilente (V, iv).
In the _Myrroure for Magistrates_ (1587) we find,
  And Brutus thou, my sonne, quoth I, whom erst I loved best.
The Latin form of the phrase possibly originated, as Malone suggested,
in the Latin play referred to above (Earlier Plays) which was acted at
Oxford in 1582. It is easy to see how the Elizabethan tendency to
word-quibble and equivoque would help to give currency to the Latin
form. Cf. Hamlet's joke on 'brute' quoted above.
BRUTUS'S SPEECH, III, ii
In view of the close connection between _Julius Caesar_ and _Hamlet_ as
regards date of composition and the characterization of Brutus and
Hamlet, interest attaches to Professor Gollancz's theory (_Julius
Caesar_, Temple Shakespeare) that the original of the famous speech of
Brutus to the assembled Romans (III, ii) may be found in Belleforest's
_History of Hamlet_, in the oration which Hamlet makes to the Danes
after he has slain his uncle. "The situation of Hamlet is almost
identical with that of Brutus after he has dealt the blow, and the
burden of Hamlet's too lengthy speech finds an echo in Brutus's
sententious utterance. The verbose iteration of the Dane has been
compressed to suit 'the brief compendious manner of speech of the
Lacedaemonians.'"--Gollancz. As the English translation from which
Professor Gollancz quotes in support of his theory is dated 1608, and is
the earliest known,[1] it cannot have been from this that Shakespeare
drew any suggestions or material. The question arises, Did Shakespeare
read the speech in the original French? The volume of Belleforest's
_Histoires Tragiques_, which contained the story of Hamlet, was first
published in 1570, and there were many reprintings of it before 1600.
