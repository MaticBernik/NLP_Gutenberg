CELIA.
Pr'ythee, who is't that thou mean'st?
TOUCHSTONE.
One that old Frederick, your father, loves.
CELIA.
My father's love is enough to honour him enough: speak
no more of him: you'll be whipp'd for taxation one of these days.
TOUCHSTONE.
The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what
wise men do foolishly.
CELIA.
By my troth, thou sayest true: for since the little wit that
fools have was silenced, the little foolery that wise men
have makes a great show. Here comes Monsieur Le Beau.
ROSALIND.
With his mouth full of news.
CELIA.
Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young.
ROSALIND.
Then shall we be news-crammed.
CELIA.
All the better; we shall be the more marketable.
[Enter LE BEAU.]
Bon jour, Monsieur Le Beau. What's the news?
LE BEAU.
Fair princess, you have lost much good sport.
CELIA.
Sport! of what colour?
LE BEAU.
What colour, madam? How shall I answer you?
ROSALIND.
As wit and fortune will.
TOUCHSTONE.
Or as the destinies decrees.
CELIA.
Well said: that was laid on with a trowel.
TOUCHSTONE.
Nay, if I keep not my rank,--
ROSALIND.
Thou losest thy old smell.
LE BEAU.
You amaze me, ladies; I would have told you of good
wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.
ROSALIND.
Yet tell us the manner of the wrestling.
LE BEAU.
I will tell you the beginning, and, if it please your
ladyships, you may see the end; for the best is yet to do;
and here, where you are, they are coming to perform it.
CELIA.
Well,--the beginning, that is dead and buried.
LE BEAU.
There comes an old man and his three sons,--
CELIA.
I could match this beginning with an old tale.
LE BEAU.
Three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence, with
bills on their necks,--
ROSALIND.
'Be it known unto all men by these presents,'--
LE BEAU.
The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the duke's
wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him, and broke three of
his ribs, that there is little hope of life in him: so he served
the second, and so the third. Yonder they lie; the poor old man,
their father, making such pitiful dole over them that all the
beholders take his part with weeping.
ROSALIND.
Alas!
TOUCHSTONE.
But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies have lost?
LE BEAU.
Why, this that I speak of.
TOUCHSTONE.
Thus men may grow wiser every day! It is the first time
that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies.
CELIA.
Or I, I promise thee.
ROSALIND.
But is there any else longs to see this broken music
in his sides? is there yet another dotes upon rib-breaking?--
Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?
LE BEAU.
You must, if you stay here: for here is the place
appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to perform it.
CELIA.
Yonder, sure, they are coming: let us now stay and see it.
