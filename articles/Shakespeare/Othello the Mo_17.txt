[Enter Roderigo.]
How now, Roderigo!
RODERIGO.
I do follow here in the chase, not like a hound that hunts,
but one that fills up the cry. My money is almost spent; I
have been to-night exceedingly well cudgelled; and I think
the issue will be--I shall have so much experience for my
pains: and so, with no money at all and a little more wit,
return again to Venice.
IAGO.
How poor are they that have not patience!
What wound did ever heal but by degrees?
Thou know'st we work by wit, and not by witchcraft;
And wit depends on dilatory time.
Does't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee,
And thou, by that small hurt, hast cashier'd Cassio;
Though other things grow fair against the sun,
Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe:
Content thyself awhile.--By the mass, 'tis morning;
Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.--
Retire thee; go where thou art billeted:
Away, I say; thou shalt know more hereafter;
Nay, get thee gone.
[Exit Roderigo.]
Two things are to be done,--
My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress;
I'll set her on;
Myself the while to draw the Moor apart,
And bring him jump when he may Cassio find
Soliciting his wife. Ay, that's the way;
Dull not device by coldness and delay.
[Exit.]
ACT III.
SCENE I. Cyprus. Before the Castle.
[Enter Cassio and some Musicians.]
CASSIO.
Masters, play here,--I will content your pains,
Something that's brief; and bid "Good-morrow, general."
[Music.]
[Enter Clown.]
CLOWN.
Why, masters, have your instruments been in Naples, that they
speak i' the nose thus?
FIRST MUSICIAN.
How, sir, how!
CLOWN.
Are these, I pray you, wind instruments?
FIRST MUSICIAN.
Ay, marry, are they, sir.
CLOWN.
O, thereby hangs a tale.
FIRST MUSICIAN.
Whereby hangs a tale, sir?
CLOWN.
Marry, sir, by many a wind instrument that I know. But, masters,
here's money for you: and the general so likes your music, that
he desires you, for love's sake, to make no more noise with it.
FIRST MUSICIAN.
Well, sir, we will not.
CLOWN.
If you have any music that may not be heard, to't again: but,
as they say, to hear music the general does not greatly care.
FIRST MUSICIAN.
We have none such, sir.
CLOWN.
Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I'll away: go, vanish
into air, away!
[Exeunt Musicians.]
CASSIO.
Dost thou hear, mine honest friend?
CLOWN.
No, I hear not your honest friend; I hear you.
CASSIO.
Pr'ythee, keep up thy quillets. There's a poor piece of gold
for thee: if the gentlewoman that attends the general's wife
be stirring, tell her there's one Cassio entreats her a little
favour of speech: wilt thou do this?
CLOWN.
She is stirring, sir; if she will stir hither I shall
seem to notify unto her.
CASSIO.
Do, good my friend.
[Exit Clown.]
[Enter Iago.]
In happy time, Iago.
IAGO.
You have not been a-bed, then?
CASSIO.
Why, no; the day had broke
Before we parted. I have made bold, Iago,
To send in to your wife: my suit to her
Is, that she will to virtuous Desdemona
Procure me some access.
