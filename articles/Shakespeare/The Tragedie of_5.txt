_Laer._ Dread my Lord,                              [Sidenote: My dread]
Your leaue and fauour to returne to France,
From whence, though willingly I came to Denmarke
To shew my duty in your Coronation,
Yet now I must confesse, that duty done,
[Sidenote: 22] My thoughts and wishes bend againe towards toward
France,[4]
And bow them to your gracious leaue and pardon.
_King._ Haue you your Fathers leaue?
What sayes _Pollonius_?
[A] _Pol._ He hath my Lord:
I do beseech you giue him leaue to go.
_King._ Take thy faire houre _Laertes_, time be thine,
And thy best graces spend it at thy will:
But now my Cosin _Hamlet_, and my Sonne?
[Footnote A: _In the Quarto_:--
_Polo._ Hath[5] my Lord wroung from me my slowe leaue
By laboursome petition, and at last
Vpon his will I seald my hard consent,[6]
I doe beseech you giue him leaue to goe.]

[Footnote 2: 'Before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet
speaking, I will hear.'--_Isaiah_, lxv. 24.]
[Footnote 3: The villain king courts his courtiers.]
[Footnote 4: He had been educated there. Compare 23. But it would seem
rather to the court than the university he desired to return. See his
father's instructions, 38.]
[Footnote 5: _H'ath_--a contraction for _He hath_.]
[Footnote 6: A play upon the act of sealing a will with wax.]
[Page 20]
_Ham._ A little more then kin, and lesse then kinde.[1]
_King._ How is it that the Clouds still hang on you?
_Ham._ Not so my Lord, I am too much i'th'Sun.[2]
                                [Sidenote: so much my ... in the sonne.]
_Queen._ Good Hamlet cast thy nightly colour off,[4]
                                                  [Sidenote: nighted[3]]
And let thine eye looke like a Friend on Denmarke.
Do not for euer with thy veyled[5] lids               [Sidenote: vailed]
Seeke for thy Noble Father in the dust;
Thou know'st 'tis common, all that liues must dye,
Passing through Nature, to Eternity.
_Ham._ I Madam, it is common.[6]
_Queen._ If it be;
Why seemes it so particular with thee.
_Ham._ Seemes Madam? Nay, it is: I know not Seemes:[7]
'Tis not alone my Inky Cloake (good Mother)
                                     [Sidenote: cloake coold mother [8]]
Nor Customary suites of solemne Blacke,
Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
No, nor the fruitfull Riuer in the Eye,
Nor the deiected hauiour of the Visage,
Together with all Formes, Moods, shewes of Griefe,
                                           [Sidenote: moodes, chapes of]
That can denote me truly. These indeed Seeme,[9]      [Sidenote: deuote]
For they are actions that a man might[10] play:
But I haue that Within, which passeth show;           [Sidenote: passes]
These, but the Trappings, and the Suites of woe.
_King._ 'Tis sweet and commendable
In your Nature _Hamlet_,
To giue these mourning duties to your Father:[11]
But you must know, your Father lost a Father,
That Father lost, lost his, and the Suruiuer bound
In filiall Obligation, for some terme
To do obsequious[12] Sorrow. But to perseuer
In obstinate Condolement, is a course
[Footnote 1: An _aside_. Hamlet's first utterance is of dislike to his
uncle. He is more than _kin_ through his unwelcome marriage--less than
_kind_ by the difference in their natures. To be _kind_ is to behave as
one _kinned_ or related. But the word here is the noun, and means
_nature_, or sort by birth.]
