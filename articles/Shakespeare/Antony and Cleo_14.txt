CAESAR, ANTONY, and LEPIDUS.
That's our offer.
POMPEY.
Know, then,
I came before you here a man prepar'd
To take this offer: but Mark Antony
Put me to some impatience:--though I lose
The praise of it by telling, you must know,
When Caesar and your brother were at blows,
Your mother came to Sicily, and did find
Her welcome friendly.
ANTONY.
I have heard it, Pompey,
And am well studied for a liberal thanks
Which I do owe you.
POMPEY.
Let me have your hand:
I did not think, sir, to have met you here.
ANTONY.
The beds i' the East are soft; and, thanks to you,
That call'd me, timelier than my purpose, hither;
For I have gained by it.
CAESAR.
Since I saw you last
There is a change upon you.
POMPEY.
Well, I know not
What counts harsh fortune casts upon my face;
But in my bosom shall she never come
To make my heart her vassal.
LEPIDUS.
Well met here.
POMPEY.
I hope so, Lepidus.--Thus we are agreed:
I crave our composition may be written,
And seal'd between us.
CAESAR.
That's the next to do.
POMPEY.
We'll feast each other ere we part; and let's
Draw lots who shall begin.
ANTONY.
That will I, Pompey.
POMPEY.
No, Antony, take the lot: but, first
Or last, your fine Egyptian cookery
Shall have the fame. I have heard that Julius Caesar
Grew fat with feasting there.
ANTONY.
You have heard much.
POMPEY.
I have fair meanings, sir.
ANTONY.
And fair words to them.
POMPEY.
Then so much have I heard;
And I have heard Apollodorus carried,--
ENOBARBUS.
No more of that:--he did so.
POMPEY.
What, I pray you?
ENOBARBUS.
A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.
POMPEY.
I know thee now: how far'st thou, soldier?
ENOBARBUS.
Well;
And well am like to do; for I perceive
Four feasts are toward.
POMPEY.
Let me shake thy hand;
I never hated thee: I have seen thee fight,
When I have envied thy behaviour.
ENOBARBUS.
Sir,
I never lov'd you much; but I ha' prais'd ye
When you have well deserv'd ten times as much
As I have said you did.
POMPEY.
Enjoy thy plainness;
It nothing ill becomes thee.--
Aboard my galley I invite you all:
Will you lead, lords?
CAESAR, ANTONY, and LEPIDUS.
Show's the way, sir.
POMPEY.
Come.
[Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS and MENAS.]
MENAS.
[Aside.] Thy father, Pompey, would ne'er have made this treaty.--
You and I have known, sir.
ENOBARBUS.
At sea, I think.
MENAS.
We have, sir.
ENOBARBUS.
You have done well by water.
MENAS.
And you by land.
ENOBARBUS.
I will praise any man that will praise me; though it cannot be
denied what I have done by land.
MENAS.
Nor what I have done by water.
ENOBARBUS.
Yes, something you can deny for your own safety: you have been a
great thief by sea.
MENAS.
And you by land.
ENOBARBUS.
There I deny my land service. But give me your hand, Menas: if
our eyes had authority, here they might take two thieves kissing.
