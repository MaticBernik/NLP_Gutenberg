ARMADO.
Why tough senior? Why tough senior?
MOTH.
Why tender juvenal? Why tender juvenal?
ARMADO.
I spoke it, tender juvenal, as a congruent epitheton
appertaining to thy young days, which we may nominate tender.
MOTH.
And I, tough senior, as an appertinent title to your old
time, which we may name tough.
ARMADO.
Pretty and apt.
MOTH.
How mean you, sir? I pretty, and my saying apt? or I apt, and
my saying pretty?
ARMADO.
Thou pretty, because little.
MOTH.
Little pretty, because little. Wherefore apt?
ARMADO.
And therefore apt, because quick.
MOTH.
Speak you this in my praise, master?
ARMADO.
In thy condign praise.
MOTH.
I will praise an eel with the same praise.
ARMADO.
What! That an eel is ingenious?
MOTH.
That an eel is quick.
ARMADO.
I do say thou art quick in answers: thou heat'st my blood.
MOTH.
I am answered, sir.
ARMADO.
I love not to be crossed.
MOTH.
[Aside] He speaks the mere contrary: crosses love not him.
ARMADO.
I have promised to study three years with the duke.
MOTH.
You may do it in an hour, sir.
ARMADO.
Impossible.
MOTH.
How many is one thrice told?
@@@@
ARMADO.
I am ill at reck'ning; it fitteth the spirit of a tapster.
MOTH.
You are a gentleman and a gamester, sir.
ARMADO.
I confess both: they are both the varnish of a complete man.
MOTH.
Then I am sure you know how much the gross sum of deuce-ace
amounts to.
ARMADO.
It doth amount to one more than two.
MOTH.
Which the base vulgar do call three.
ARMADO.
True.
MOTH.
Why, sir, is this such a piece of study? Now here's three
studied ere ye'll thrice wink; and how easy it is to put 'years'
to the word 'three,' and study three years in two words, the
dancing horse will tell you.
ARMADO.
A most fine figure!
MOTH.
[Aside] To prove you a cipher.
ARMADO.
I will hereupon confess I am in love; and as it is base for
a soldier to love, so am I in love with a base wench. If drawing
my sword against the humour of affection would deliver me from
the reprobate thought of it, I would take Desire prisoner, and
ransom him to any French courtier for a new-devised curtsy. I
think scorn to sigh: methinks I should out-swear Cupid. Comfort
me, boy: what great men have been in love?
MOTH.
Hercules, master.
ARMADO.
Most sweet Hercules! More authority, dear boy, name more;
and, sweet my child, let them be men of good repute and carriage.
MOTH.
Samson, master: he was a man of good carriage, great
carriage, for he carried the town gates on his back like a
porter; and he was in love.
ARMADO.
O well-knit Samson! strong-jointed Samson! I do excel thee
in my rapier as much as thou didst me in carrying gates. I am in
love too. Who was Samson's love, my dear Moth?
MOTH.
A woman, master.
ARMADO.
Of what complexion?
MOTH.
Of all the four, or the three, or the two, or one of the
four.
