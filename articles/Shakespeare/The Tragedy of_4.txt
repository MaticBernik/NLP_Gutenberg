[Another alarum. The Volsces and Romans re-enter, and the fight
is renewed. The Volsces retire into Corioli, and MARCIUS follows
them to the gates.]
So, now the gates are ope:--now prove good seconds:
'Tis for the followers fortune widens them,
Not for the fliers: mark me, and do the like.
[He enters the gates]
FIRST SOLDIER.
Fool-hardiness: not I.
SECOND SOLDIER.
Nor I.
[MARCIUS is shut in.]
FIRST SOLDIER.
See, they have shut him in.
ALL.
To th' pot, I warrant him.
[Alarum continues]
[Re-enter TITUS LARTIUS.]
LARTIUS.
What is become of Marcius?
ALL.
Slain, sir, doubtless.
FIRST SOLDIER.
Following the fliers at the very heels,
With them he enters; who, upon the sudden,
Clapp'd-to their gates: he is himself alone,
To answer all the city.
LARTIUS.
O noble fellow!
Who sensible, outdares his senseless sword,
And when it bows stands up! Thou art left, Marcius:
A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,
Were not so rich a jewel. Thou wast a soldier
Even to Cato's wish, not fierce and terrible
Only in strokes; but with thy grim looks and
The thunder-like percussion of thy sounds
Thou mad'st thine enemies shake, as if the world
Were feverous and did tremble.
[Re-enter MARCIUS, bleeding, assaulted by the enemy.]
FIRST SOLDIER.
Look, sir.
LARTIUS.
O, 'tis Marcius!
Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike.
[They fight, and all enter the city.]
SCENE V. Within Corioli. A street.
[Enter certain Romans, with spoils.]
FIRST ROMAN.
This will I carry to Rome.
SECOND ROMAN.
And I this.
THIRD ROMAN.
A murrain on't! I took this for silver.
[Alarum continues still afar off.]
[Enter MARCIUS and TITUS LARTIUS with a trumpet.]
MARCIUS.
See here these movers that do prize their hours
At a crack'd drachma! Cushions, leaden spoons,
Irons of a doit, doublets that hangmen would
Bury with those that wore them, these base slaves,
Ere yet the fight be done, pack up:--down with them!--
And hark, what noise the general makes!--To him!--
There is the man of my soul's hate, Aufidius,
Piercing our Romans; then, valiant Titus, take
Convenient numbers to make good the city;
Whilst I, with those that have the spirit, will haste
To help Cominius.
LARTIUS.
Worthy sir, thou bleed'st;
Thy exercise hath been too violent
For a second course of fight.
MARCIUS.
Sir, praise me not;
My work hath yet not warm'd me: fare you well;
The blood I drop is rather physical
Than dangerous to me: to Aufidius thus
I will appear, and fight.
LARTIUS.
Now the fair goddess, Fortune,
Fall deep in love with thee; and her great charms
Misguide thy opposers' swords! Bold gentleman,
Prosperity be thy page!
MARCIUS.
Thy friend no less
Than those she placeth highest!--So farewell.
LARTIUS.
Thou worthiest Marcius!--
[Exit MARCIUS.]
Go, sound thy trumpet in the market-place;
Call thither all the officers o' the town,
Where they shall know our mind: away!
[Exeunt.]
SCENE VI. Near the camp of COMINIUS.
[Enter COMINIUS and Foreces, retreating.]
COMINIUS.
Breathe you, my friends: well fought; we are come off
Like Romans, neither foolish in our stands
Nor cowardly in retire: believe me, sirs,
We shall be charg'd again. Whiles we have struck,
By interims and conveying gusts we have heard
The charges of our friends. The Roman gods,
Lead their successes as we wish our own,
That both our powers, with smiling fronts encountering,
May give you thankful sacrifice!--
