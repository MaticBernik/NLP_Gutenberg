HOSTESS.
Sick of a calm; yea, good faith.
FALSTAFF.
So is all her sect; an they be once in a calm, they are sick.
DOLL.
You muddy rascal, is that all the comfort you give me?
FALSTAFF.
You make fat rascals, Mistress Doll.
DOLL.
I make them! gluttony and diseases make them; I make them not.
FALSTAFF.
If the cook help to make the gluttony, you help to make the diseases,
Doll:  we catch of you, Doll, we catch of you; grant that, my poor
virtue, grant that.
DOLL.
Yea, joy, our chains and our jewels.
FALSTAFF.
"Your brooches, pearls, and ouches:"  for to serve bravely is to come
halting off, you know:  to come off the breach with his pike bent
bravely, and to surgery bravely; to venture upon the charged chambers
bravely,--
DOLL.
Hang yourself, you muddy conger, hang yourself!
HOSTESS.
By my troth, this is the old fashion; you two never meet but you
fall to some discord:  you are both, i' good truth, as rheumatic
as two dry toasts; you cannot one bear with another's confirmities.
What the good-year! one must bear, and that must be you:  you are the
weaker vessel, as as they say, the emptier vessel.
DOLL.
Can a weak empty vessel bear such a huge full hogshead? there's a whole
merchant's venture of Bourdeaux stuff in him; you have not seen a hulk
better stuffed in the hold. Come, I'll be friends with thee, Jack:
thou art going to the wars; and whether I shall ever see thee again or
no, there is nobody cares.
[Re-enter First Drawer.]
FIRST DRAWER.
Sir, Ancient Pistol's below, and would speak with you.
DOLL.
Hang him, swaggering rascal! let him not come hither:  it is the
foul-mouthed'st rogue in England.
HOSTESS.
If he swagger, let him not come here:  no, by my faith; I must live
among my neighbours; I'll no swaggerers:  I am in good name and fame
with the very best:  shut the door; there comes no swaggerers here:
I have not lived all this while, to have swaggering now:  shut the
door, I pray you.
FALSTAFF.
Dost thou hear, hostess?
HOSTESS.
Pray ye, pacify yourself, Sir John:  there comes no swaggerers here.
FALSTAFF.
Dost thou hear? it is mine ancient.
HOSTESS.
Tilly-fally, Sir John, ne'er tell me:  your ancient swaggerer comes
not in my doors. I was before Master Tisick, the debuty, t'other day;
and, as he said to me, 'twas no longer ago than Wednesday last,
"I' good faith, neighbour Quickly," says he; Master Dumbe, our
minister, was by then; "neighbour Quickly," says he, "receive those
that are civil; for" said he "you are in an ill name:"  now a' said
so, I can tell whereupon; "for," says he, "you are an honest woman,
and well thought on; therefore take heed what guests you receive:
receive," says he, "no swaggering companions."  There comes none here:
you would bless you to hear what he said:  no, I'll no swaggerers.
FALSTAFF.
He's no swaggerer, hostess; a tame cheater, i' faith; you may stroke
him as gently as a puppy greyhound:  he'll not swagger with a Barbary
hen, if her feathers turn back in any show of resistance. Call
him up, drawer.
