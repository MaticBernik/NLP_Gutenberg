BASSANIO, PORTIA, GRATIANO, NERISSA, _and Attendants_.
_Por_. I pray you, tarry; pause a day or two,
Before you hazard; for, in choosing wrong
I lose your company; I could teach you
How to choose right, but then I am forsworn;
So will I never be: so may you miss me;
But if you do, you'll make me wish a sin,
That I had been forsworn.
_Bas_. Let me choose;
For, as I am, I live upon the rack.
Come, let me to my fortune and the caskets.
_Por_. Away then: I am lock'd in one of them;
If you do love me, you will find me out.
Let music sound, while he doth make his choice:
Then, if he lose, he makes a swan-like end,
Fading in music.(B)--That the comparison
May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream
And wat'ry death-bed for him.
[_Music, whilst_ BASSANIO _comments on the Caskets to himself_.
    SONG.[81]
        1. Tell me where is fancy bred.
           Or in the heart, or in the head?
           How begot, how nourished
               Reply, reply.
    2. It is engender'd in the eyes,
       With gazing fed; and fancy dies
       In the cradle where it lies:
         Let us all ring fancy's knell;
       I'll begin it.--Ding, dong, bell.
    _All_. Ding, dong, bell.
[_Exeunt all but_ PORTIA _and_ BASSANIO.
_Bas_. So may the outward shows be least themselves;[82]
The world is still deceiv'd with ornament.
In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt,
But, being season'd with a gracious voice,[83]
Obscures the show of evil? In religion,
What damned error, but some sober brow
Will bless it and approve it[84] with a text,
Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?
There is no vice so simple, but assumes
Some mark of virtue on his outward parts.
Thus ornament is but the guiled[85] shore
To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf
Veiling an Indian beauty. Therefore, thou gaudy gold,
Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee:
Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge
'Tween man and man. But thou, thou meagre lead,
Which rather threat'nest than dost promise aught,
Thy plainness moves me more than eloquence,
And here choose I. Joy be the consequence!
_Por_. How all the other passions fleet to air!
O love, be moderate, allay thy ecstacy,
I feel too much thy blessing, make it less,
For fear I surfeit!
_Bas_. What find I here!
[_Opening the leaden casket_.
Fair Portia's counterfeit?[86]--Here's the scroll,
The continent and summary of my fortune.
    'You that choose not by the view,
    Chance as felt, and choose as true!
    Since this fortune falls to you,
    Be content, and seek no new.
    If you be well pleas'd with this,
    And hold your fortune for your bliss.
    Turn you where your lady is,
    And claim her with a loving kiss.'
A gentle scroll.--Fair lady, by your leave,
I come by note, to give and to receive.
Yet doubtful whether what I see be true,
Until confirm'd, sign'd, ratified by you.
_Por_. You see, my lord Bassanio, where I stand,
Such as I am: though, for myself alone,
I would not be ambitious in my wish,
To wish myself much better; yet, for you,
I would be trebled twenty times myself.
But now I was the lord
Of this fair mansion, master of my servants,
Queen o'er myself; and even now, but now,
This house, these servants, and this same myself.
Are yours, my lord,--I give them with this ring;
Which, when you part from, lose, or give away,
Let it presage the ruin of your love,
And be my vantage to exclaim on you.
