_Caius._ Diable!--Jack Rugby,--mine host de Jarteer,--have
I not stay for him to kill him? have I not, at de
place I did appoint?                                                85
_Evans._ As I am a Christians soul, now, look you, this
is the place appointed: I'll be judgement by mine host of
the Garter.
_Host._ Peace, I say, Gallia and Gaul, French and
Welsh, soul-curer and body-curer!                                   90
_Caius._ Ay, dat is very good; excellent.
_Host._ Peace, I say! hear mine host of the Garter. Am
I politic? am I subtle? am I a Machiavel? Shall I lose my
doctor? no; he gives me the potions and the motions.
Shall I lose my parson, my priest, my Sir Hugh? no; he              95
gives me the proverbs and the no-verbs. [Give me thy
hand, terrestrial; so.] Give me thy hand, celestial; so.
Boys of art, I have deceived you both; I have directed
you to wrong places: your hearts are mighty, your skins
are whole, and let burnt sack be the issue. Come, lay their        100
swords to pawn. Follow me, lads of peace; follow, follow,
follow.
_Shal._ Trust me, a mad host. Follow, gentlemen,
follow.
_Slen._ [_Aside_] O sweet Anne Page!
    [_Exeunt Shal., Slen., Page, and Host._                        105
_Caius._ Ha, do I perceive dat? have you make-a de sot
of us, ha, ha?
_Evans._ This is well; he has made us his vlouting-stog. --I
desire you that we may be friends; and let us knog our
prains together to be revenge on this same scall, scurvy,          110
cogging companion, the host of the Garter.
_Caius._ By gar, with all my heart. He promise to bring
me where is Anne Page; by gar, he deceive me too.
_Evans._ Well, I will smite his noddles. Pray you,
follow.    [_Exeunt._                                              115
