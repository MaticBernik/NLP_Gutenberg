    _Pet._ I know her father, though I know not her;
    And he knew my deceased father well.
    I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her;                     100
    And therefore let me be thus bold with you
    To give you over at this first encounter,
    Unless you will accompany me thither.
    _Gru._ I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts.
    O' my word, an she knew him as well as I do, she would think     105
    scolding would do little good upon him: she may perhaps
    call him half a score knaves or so: why, that's nothing; an
    he begin once, he'll rail in his rope-tricks. I'll tell you what,
    sir, an she stand him but a little, he will throw a figure in
    her face and so disfigure her with it that she shall have no     110
    more eyes to see withal than a cat. You know him not, sir.
    _Hor._ Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee;
    For in Baptista's keep my treasure is:
    He hath the jewel of my life in hold,
    His youngest daughter, beautiful Bianca;                         115
    And her withholds from me and other more,
    Suitors to her and rivals in my love;
    Supposing it a thing impossible,
    For those defects I have before rehearsed,
    That ever Katharina will be woo'd;                               120
    Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en,
    That none shall have access unto Bianca
    Till Katharine the curst have got a husband.
    _Gru._ Katharine the curst!
    A title for a maid of all titles the worst.                      125
    _Hor._ Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace;
    And offer me disguised in sober robes
    To old Baptista as a schoolmaster
    Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca;
    That so I may, by this device, at least                          130
    Have leave and leisure to make love to her
    And unsuspected court her by herself.
    _Gru._ Here's no knavery! See, to beguile the old
    folks, how the young folks lay their heads together!
_Enter_ GREMIO, _and_ LUCENTIO _disguised_.
    Master, master, look about you: who goes there, ha?              135
    _Hor._ Peace, Grumio! it is the rival of my love.
    Petruchio, stand by a while.
    _Gru._ A proper stripling and an amorous!
    _Gre._ O, very well; I have perused the note.
    Hark you, sir; I'll have them very fairly bound:                 140
    All books of love, see that at any hand;
    And see you read no other lectures to her:
    You understand me: over and beside
    Signior Baptista's liberality,
    I'll mend it with a largess. Take your paper too,                145
    And let me have them very well perfumed:
    For she is sweeter than perfume itself
    To whom they go to. What will you read to her?
    _Luc._ Whate'er I read to her, I'll plead for you
    As for my patron, stand you so assured,                          150
    As firmly as yourself were still in place:
    Yea, and perhaps with more successful words
    Than you, unless you were a scholar, sir.
    _Gre._ O this learning, what a thing it is!
    _Gru._ O this woodcock, what an ass it is!                       155
