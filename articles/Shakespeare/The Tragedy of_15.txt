MENENIUS.
Worthy man!
FIRST SENATOR.
He cannot but with measure fit the honours
Which we devise him.
COMINIUS.
Our spoils he kick'd at;
And looked upon things precious as they were
The common muck of the world: he covets less
Than misery itself would give; rewards
His deeds with doing them; and is content
To spend the time to end it.
MENENIUS.
He's right noble:
Let him be call'd for.
FIRST SENATOR.
Call Coriolanus.
OFFICER.
He doth appear.
[Re-enter CORIOLANUS.]
MENENIUS.
The Senate, Coriolanus, are well pleas'd
To make thee consul.
CORIOLANUS.
I do owe them still
My life and services.
MENENIUS.
It then remains
That you do speak to the people.
CORIOLANUS.
I do beseech you
Let me o'erleap that custom; for I cannot
Put on the gown, stand naked, and entreat them,
For my wounds' sake to give their suffrage: please you
That I may pass this doing.
SICINIUS.
Sir, the people
Must have their voices; neither will they bate
One jot of ceremony.
MENENIUS.
Put them not to't:--
Pray you, go fit you to the custom; and
Take to you, as your predecessors have,
Your honour with your form.
CORIOLANUS.
It is a part
That I shall blush in acting, and might well
Be taken from the people.
BRUTUS.
Mark you that?
CORIOLANUS.
To brag unto them,--thus I did, and thus;--
Show them the unaching scars which I should hide,
As if I had receiv'd them for the hire
Of their breath only!
MENENIUS.
Do not stand upon't.--
We recommend to you, tribunes of the people,
Our purpose to them;--and to our noble consul
Wish we all joy and honour.
SENATORS.
To Coriolanus come all joy and honour!
[Flourish. Exeunt all but SICINIUS and BRUTUS.]
BRUTUS.
You see how he intends to use the people.
SICINIUS.
May they perceive's intent! He will require them
As if he did contemn what he requested
Should be in them to give.
BRUTUS.
Come, we'll inform them
Of our proceedings here: on the market-place
I know they do attend us.
[Exeunt.]
SCENE III. Rome. The Forum.
[Enter several citizens.]
FIRST CITIZEN.
Once, if he do require our voices, we ought not to deny him.
SECOND CITIZEN.
We may, sir, if we will.
THIRD CITIZEN.
We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a power that we
have no power to do: for if he show us his wounds and tell us his
deeds, we are to put our tongues into those wounds and speak for
them; so, if he tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell him
our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is monstrous: and for
the multitude to be ingrateful were to make a monster of the
multitude; of the which we being members, should bring ourselves
to be monstrous members.
FIRST CITIZEN.
And to make us no better thought of, a little help will serve;
for once we stood up about the corn, he himself stuck not to call
us the many-headed multitude.
