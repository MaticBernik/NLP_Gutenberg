OTHELLO.
What is the matter, think you?
CASSIO.
Something from Cyprus, as I may divine:
It is a business of some heat: the galleys
Have sent a dozen sequent messengers
This very night at one another's heels;
And many of the consuls, rais'd and met,
Are at the duke's already: you have been hotly call'd for;
When, being not at your lodging to be found,
The senate hath sent about three several quests
To search you out.
OTHELLO.
'Tis well I am found by you.
I will but spend a word here in the house,
And go with you.
[Exit.]
CASSIO.
Ancient, what makes he here?
IAGO.
Faith, he to-night hath boarded a land carack:
If it prove lawful prize, he's made forever.
CASSIO.
I do not understand.
IAGO.
He's married.
CASSIO.
To who?
[Re-enter Othello.]
IAGO.
Marry, to--Come, captain, will you go?
OTHELLO.
Have with you.
CASSIO.
Here comes another troop to seek for you.
IAGO.
It is Brabantio.--General, be advis'd;
He comes to bad intent.
[Enter Brabantio, Roderigo, and Officers with torches and
weapons.]
OTHELLO.
Holla! stand there!
RODERIGO.
Signior, it is the Moor.
BRABANTIO.
Down with him, thief!
[They draw on both sides.]
IAGO.
You, Roderigo! come, sir, I am for you.
OTHELLO.
Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them.--
Good signior, you shall more command with years
Than with your weapons.
BRABANTIO.
O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow'd my daughter?
Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchanted her;
For I'll refer me to all things of sense,
If she in chains of magic were not bound,
Whether a maid so tender, fair, and happy,
So opposite to marriage that she shunn'd
The wealthy curled darlings of our nation,
Would ever have, to incur a general mock,
Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom
Of such a thing as thou,--to fear, not to delight.
Judge me the world, if 'tis not gross in sense
That thou hast practis'd on her with foul charms;
Abus'd her delicate youth with drugs or minerals
That weaken motion:--I'll have't disputed on;
'Tis probable, and palpable to thinking.
I therefore apprehend and do attach thee
For an abuser of the world, a practiser
Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.--
Lay hold upon him: if he do resist,
Subdue him at his peril.
OTHELLO.
Hold your hands,
Both you of my inclining and the rest:
Were it my cue to fight, I should have known it
Without a prompter.--Where will you that I go
To answer this your charge?
BRABANTIO.
To prison; till fit time
Of law and course of direct session
Call thee to answer.
OTHELLO.
What if I do obey?
How may the duke be therewith satisfied,
Whose messengers are here about my side,
Upon some present business of the state,
To bring me to him?
FIRST OFFICER.
'Tis true, most worthy signior;
The duke's in council, and your noble self,
I am sure, is sent for.
BRABANTIO.
How! the duke in council!
In this time of the night!--Bring him away:
Mine's not an idle cause: the duke himself,
Or any of my brothers of the state,
Cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own;
For if such actions may have passage free,
Bond slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.
