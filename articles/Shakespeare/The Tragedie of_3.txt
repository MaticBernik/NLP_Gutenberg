_Hor_. And then it started, like a guilty thing
Vpon a fearfull Summons. I haue heard,
The Cocke that is the Trumpet to the day,      [Sidenote: to the morne,]
Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding Throate[7]
Awake the God of Day: and at his warning,
Whether in Sea, or Fire, in Earth, or Ayre,
Th'extrauagant,[8] and erring[9] Spirit, hyes
To his Confine. And of the truth heerein,
This present Obiect made probation.[10]
_Mar_. It faded on the crowing of the Cocke.[11]

_Horatio_: he would stop it.]

[Footnote 6: 'As we cannot hurt it, our blows are a mockery; and it is
wrong to mock anything so majestic': _For_ belongs to _shew_; 'We do it
wrong, being so majestical, to offer it what is but a _show_ of
violence, for it is, &c.']

Marcellus takes refuge in the thought of the Saviour's birth into the

Some sayes, that euer 'gainst that Season comes          [Sidenote: say]
Wherein our Sauiours Birth is celebrated,
The Bird of Dawning singeth all night long:        [Sidenote: This bird]
And then (they say) no Spirit can walke abroad,
                                          [Sidenote: spirit dare sturre]
The nights are wholsome, then no Planets strike,
No Faiery talkes, nor Witch hath power to Charme:
                                             [Sidenote: fairy takes,[1]]
So hallow'd, and so gracious is the time.      [Sidenote: is that time.]
_Hor._ So haue I heard, and do in part beleeue it.
But looke, the Morne in Russet mantle clad,
Walkes o're the dew of yon high Easterne Hill,   [Sidenote: Eastward[2]]
Breake we our Watch vp, and by my aduice              [Sidenote: advise]
Let vs impart what we haue scene to night
Vnto yong _Hamlet_. For vpon my life,
This Spirit dumbe to vs, will speake to him:
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
As needfull in our Loues, fitting our Duty?
[Sidenote: 30] _Mar._ Let do't I pray, and I this morning know
Where we shall finde him most conueniently.      [Sidenote: convenient.]
                                       _Exeunt._
SCENA SECUNDA[3]
_Enter Claudius King of Denmarke. Gertrude the
Queene, Hamlet, Polonius, Laertes, and his Sister
Ophelia, Lords Attendant._[4]
                  [Sidenote: _Florish. Enter Claudius, King of Denmarke,
                   Gertrad the Queene, Counsaile: as Polonius, and his
                   sonne Laertes, Hamelt Cum Abijs._]
_King._ Though yet of _Hamlet_ our deere Brothers death
                                                    [Sidenote: _Claud._]
The memory be greene: and that it vs befitted
To beare our hearts in greefe, and our whole Kingdome
To be contracted in one brow of woe:
Yet so farre hath Discretion fought with Nature,
That we with wisest sorrow thinke on him,
