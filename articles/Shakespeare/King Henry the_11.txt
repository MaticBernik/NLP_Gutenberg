    [Footnote II.8: _----quick_] That is, _living_.]
    [Footnote II.9: _----as gross_] As palpable.]
    [Footnote II.10:
      _----though the truth of it stands off as gross
      As black from white,_]
    Though the truth be as apparent and visible as black and white
    contiguous to each other. To _stand off_ is _etre releve_, to be
    prominent to the eye, as the strong parts of a picture.

    [Footnote II.11: _Which I in sufferance heartily will rejoice,_]
    Cambridge means to say, _at_ which prevention, or, which intended
    scheme that it was prevented, I shall rejoice. Shakespeare has
    many such elliptical expressions. The intended scheme that he
    alludes to was the taking off Henry, to make room for his
    brother-in-law. --MALONE.]

    must so regard.]
    [Footnote II.13: _----dear offences!----_] _To dere_, in ancient
    language, was _to hurt_; the meaning, therefore, is hurtful--
    pernicious offences.]

SCENE II.--FRANCE. A ROOM IN THE FRENCH KING'S PALACE.
  _Trumpets sound._
    _Enter the FRENCH KING,[15] attended; the DAUPHIN, the DUKE OF
    BURGUNDY, the CONSTABLE, and Others,(E) L.H._
  _Fr. King._ (C.) Thus come the English with full power upon us;
  And more than carefully it us concerns[16]
  To answer royally in our defences.
  Therefore the Dukes of Berry and of Bretagne,
  Of Brabant and of Orleans, shall make forth,--
  And you, Prince Dauphin,--with all swift despatch,
  To line and new repair our towns of war
  With men of courage and with means defendant.
  _Dau._ (R.C.) My most redoubted father,
  It is most meet we arm us 'gainst the foe:
  And let us do it with no show of fear;
  No, with no more than if we heard that England
  Were busied with a Whitsun morris-dance:
  For, my good liege, she is so idly king'd,
  Her sceptre so fantastically borne
  By a vain, giddy, shallow, humorous youth,
  That fear attends her not.
  _Con._ (L.C.) O peace, prince Dauphin
  You are too much mistaken in this king:
  With what great state he heard our embassy,
  How well supplied with noble counsellors,
  How modest in exception,[17] and withal
  How terrible in constant resolution,
  And you shall find his vanities fore-spent
  Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus,
  Covering discretion with a coat of folly.
  _Dau._ Well, 'tis not so, my lord high constable;
  But though we think it so, it is no matter:
  In cases of defence 'tis best to weigh
  The enemy more mighty than he seems:
  So the proportions of defence are fill'd.
  _Fr. King._ Think we King Harry strong;
  And, princes, look you strongly arm to meet him.
  The kindred of him hath been flesh'd upon us;
  And he is bred out of that bloody strain[18]
  That haunted us[19] in our familiar paths:
  Witness our too much memorable shame
  When Cressy battle fatally was struck,
  And all our princes captiv'd by the hand
  Of that black name, Edward, black prince of Wales;
  Whiles that his mountain sire,--on mountain standing,
  Up in the air, crown'd with the golden sun,--[20]
  Saw his heroical seed, and smil'd to see him
  Mangle the work of nature, and deface
  The patterns that by Heaven and by French fathers
  Had twenty years been made. This is a stem
  Of that victorious stock; and let us fear
  The native mightiness and fate of him.[21]
