LUCIUS' SERVANT.
Put in now, Titus.
TITUS.
My lord, here is my bill.
LUCIUS' SERVANT.
Here's mine.
HORTENSIUS.
And mine, my lord.
BOTH VARRO'S SERVANTS.
And ours, my lord.
PHILOTUS.
All our bills.
TIMON.
Knock me down with 'em: cleave me to the girdle.
LUCIUS' SERVANT.
Alas, my lord--
TIMON.
Cut my heart in sums.
TITUS.
Mine, fifty talents.
TIMON.
Tell out my blood.
LUCIUS' SERVANT.
Five thousand crowns, my lord.
TIMON.
Five thousand drops pays that. What yours? and yours?
FIRST VARRO'S SERVANT.
My lord--
SECOND VARRO'S SERVANT.
My lord--
TIMON.
Tear me, take me; and the gods fall upon you!
[Exit.]
HORTENSIUS.
Faith, I perceive our masters may throw their caps at their
money: these debts may well be called desperate ones, for a
madman owes 'em.
[Exeunt.]
[Re-enter TIMON and FLAVIUS.]
TIMON.
They have e'en put my breath from me, the slaves.
Creditors? devils!
FLAVIUS.
My dear lord--
TIMON.
What if it should be so?
FLAMINIUS.
My lord--
TIMON.
I'll have it so. My steward!
FLAVIUS.
Here, my lord.
TIMON.
So fitly! Go, bid all my friends again:
Lucius, Lucullus, and Sempronius; all:
I'll once more feast the rascals.
FLAVIUS.
O my lord!
You only speak from your distracted soul;
There is not so much left to furnish out
A moderate table.
TIMON.
Be it not in thy care: go.
I charge thee, invite them all: let in the tide
Of knaves once more; my cook and I'll provide.
[Exeunt.]
Scene V. The Same. The Senate House. The Senate Sitting.
FIRST SENATOR.
My lord, you have my voice to it: the fault's
Bloody. 'tis necessary he should die;
Nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy.
SECOND SENATOR.
Most true; the law shall bruise him.
[Enter ALCIBIADES, attended.]
ALCIBIADES.
Honour, health, and compassion to the senate!
FIRST SENATOR.
Now, captain.
ALCIBIADES.
I am a humble suitor to your virtues;
For pity is the virtue of the law,
And none but tyrants use it cruelly.
It pleases time and fortune to lie heavy
Upon a friend of mine, who, in hot blood
Hath stepp'd into the law, which is past depth
To those that without heed do plunge into't.
He is a man, setting his fate aside,
Of comely virtues;
Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice,--
An honour in him which buys out his fault,--
But, with a noble fury and fair spirit,
Seeing his reputation touch'd to death,
He did oppose his foe;
And with such sober and unnoted passion
He did behave his anger, ere 'twas spent,
As if he had but prov'd an argument.
FIRST SENATOR.
You undergo too strict a paradox,
Striving to make an ugly deed look fair:
Your words have took such pains as if they labour'd
To bring manslaughter into form, and set
Quarrelling upon the head of valour; which indeed
Is valour misbegot, and came into the world
When sects and factions were newly born.
He's truly valiant that can wisely suffer
The worst that man can breathe, and make his wrongs
his outsides, to wear them like his raiment, carelessly,
And ne'er prefer his injuries to his heart,
To bring it into danger.
If wrongs be evils, and enforce us kill,
What folly 'tis to hazard life for ill!
