APEMANTUS.
Hoy-day! what a sweep of vanity comes this way:
They dance! they are mad women.
Like madness is the glory of this life,
As this pomp shows to a little oil and root.
We make ourselves fools to disport ourselves;
And spend our flatteries to drink those men
Upon whose age we void it up again,
With poisonous spite and envy.
Who lives that's not depraved or depraves?
Who dies that bears not one spurn to their graves
Of their friend's gift?
I should fear those that dance before me now
Would one day stamp upon me: it has been done:
Men shut their doors against a setting sun.
[The LORDS rise from table, with much adoring of TIMON; and to
show their loves, each singles out an Amazon, and all dance, men
with women, a lofty strain or two to the hautboys, and cease.]
TIMON.
You have done our pleasures much grace, fair ladies,
Set a fair fashion on our entertainment,
Which was not half so beautiful and kind;
You have added worth unto 't and lustre,
And entertain'd me with mine own device;
I am to thank you for 't.
FIRST LADY.
My lord, you take us even at the best.
APEMANTUS.
Faith, for the worst is filthy; and would not hold taking, I
doubt me.
TIMON.
Ladies, there is an idle banquet
Attends you; please you to dispose yourselves.
ALL LADIES.
Most thankfully, my lord.
[Exeunt CUPID and LADIES.]
TIMON.
Flavius!
FLAVIUS.
My lord!
TIMON.
The little casket bring me hither.
FLAVIUS.
Yes, my lord. [Aside.] More jewels yet!
There is no crossing him in 's humour;
Else I should tell him well, i' faith, I should,
When all's spent, he'd be cross'd then, an he could.
'Tis pity bounty had not eyes behind,
That man might ne'er be wretched for his mind.
[Exit.]
FIRST LORD.
Where be our men?
SERVANT.
Here, my lord, in readiness.
SECOND LORD.
Our horses!
[Re-enter FLAVIUS, with the casket.]
TIMON.
O, my friends! I have one word to say to you;
Look you, my good lord,
I must entreat you, honour me so much
As to advance this jewel; accept it and wear it,
Kind my lord.
FIRST LORD.
I am so far already in your gifts--
ALL.
So are we all.
[Enter a SERVANT.]
SERVANT.
My lord, there are certain nobles of the Senate
Newly alighted and come to visit you.
TIMON.
They are fairly welcome.
FLAVIUS.
I beseech your honour,
Vouchsafe me a word; it does concern you near.
TIMON.
Near! why then, another time I'll hear thee.
I prithee let's be provided to show them entertainment.
FLAVIUS.
[Aside.]
I scarce know how.
[Enter another SERVANT.]
SECOND SERVANT.
May it please vour honour, Lord Lucius,
Out of his free love, hath presented to you
Four milk-white horses, trapp'd in silver.
TIMON.
I shall accept them fairly; let the presents
Be worthily entertain'd.
[Enter a third SERVANT.]
How now! What news?
THIRD SERVANT.
Please you, my lord, that honourable gentleman, Lord Lucullus,
entreats your company to-morrow to hunt with him, and has sent
your honour two brace of greyhounds.
