    _Kath._ Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not?
    What, shall I be appointed hours; as though, belike,
    I knew not what to take, and what to leave, ha?     [_Exit._
    _Gre._ You may go to the devil's dam: your gifts are so          105
    good, here's none will hold you. Their love is not so great,
    Hortensio, but we may blow our nails together, and fast it
    fairly out: our cake's dough on both sides. Farewell:
    yet, for the love I bear my sweet Bianca, if I can by any
    means light on a fit man to teach her that wherein she           110
    delights, I will wish him to her father.
    _Hor._ So will I, Signior Gremio: but a word, I pray.
    Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked parle,
    know now, upon advice, it toucheth us both, that we may
    yet again have access to our fair mistress, and be happy rivals  115
    in Bianca's love, to labour and effect one thing specially.
    _Gre._ What's that, I pray?
    _Hor._ Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.
    _Gre._ A husband! a devil.
    _Hor._ I say, a husband.                                         120
    _Gre._ I say, a devil. Thinkest thou, Hortensio, though
    her father be very rich, any man is so very a fool to be
    married to hell?
    _Hor._ Tush, Gremio, though it pass your patience and
    mine to endure her loud alarums, why, man, there be good         125
    fellows in the world, an a man could light on them, would
    take her with all faults, and money enough.
    _Gre._ I cannot tell; but I had as lief take her dowry with
    this condition, to be whipped at the high-cross every morning.
    _Hor._ Faith, as you say, there's small choice in rotten         130
    apples. But come; since this bar in law makes us friends,
    it shall be so far forth friendly maintained till by helping
    Baptista's eldest daughter to a husband we set his youngest
    free for a husband, and then have to't afresh. Sweet Bianca!
    Happy man be his dole! He that runs fastest gets                 135
    the ring. How say you, Signior Gremio?
    _Gre._ I am agreed; and would I had given him the best
    horse in Padua to begin his wooing that would thoroughly
    woo her, wed her and bed her and rid the house of her!
    Come on.                     [_Exeunt Gremio and Hortensio._     140
    _Tra._ I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible
    That love should of a sudden take such hold?
    _Luc._ O Tranio, till I found it to be true,
    I never thought it possible or likely;
    But see, while idly I stood looking on,                          145
    I found the effect of love in idleness:
    And now in plainness do confess to thee,
    That art to me as secret and as dear
    As Anna to the Queen of Carthage was,
    Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,                        150
    If I achieve not this young modest girl.
    Counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst;
    Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt.
