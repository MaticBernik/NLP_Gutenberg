SUFFOLK.
No malice, sir; no more than well becomes
So good a quarrel and so bad a peer.
GLOSTER.
As who, my lord?
SUFFOLK.
Why, as you, my lord,
An 't like your lordly lord-protectorship.
GLOSTER.
Why, Suffolk, England knows thine insolence.
QUEEN.
And thy ambition, Gloster.
KING.
I prithee, peace, good queen,
And whet not on these furious peers;
For blessed are the peacemakers on earth.
CARDINAL.
Let me be blessed for the peace I make
Against this proud protector, with my sword!
GLOSTER.
[Aside to Cardinal.] Faith, holy uncle, would 't
were come to that!
CARDINAL.
[Aside to Gloster.] Marry, when thou dar'st.
GLOSTER.
[Aside to Cardinal.] Make up no factious numbers
for the matter;
In thine own person answer thy abuse.
CARDINAL.
[Aside to Gloster.] Ay, where thou dar'st not peep;
an if thou dar'st,
This evening, on the east side of the grove.
KING.
How now, my lords!
CARDINAL.
Believe me, cousin Gloster,
Had not your man put up the fowl so suddenly,
We had had more sport.--[Aside to Gloster.] Come with thy
two-hand sword.
GLOSTER.
True, uncle.
CARDINAL.
[Aside to Gloster.] Are ye advis'd? the east side
of the grove?
GLOSTER.
[Aside to CARDINAL.] Cardinal, I am with you.
KING.
Why, how now, uncle Gloster!
GLOSTER.
Talking of hawking; nothing else, my lord.--
[Aside to Cardinal.] Now, by God's mother, priest,
I'll shave your crown for this,
Or all my fence shall fail.
CARDINAL.
[Aside to Gloster.] Medice, teipsum--
Protector, see to 't well, protect yourself.
KING.
The winds grow high; so do your stomachs, lords.
How irksome is this music to my heart!
When such strings jar, what hope of harmony?
I pray, my lords, let me compound this strife.
[Enter a Townsman of Saint Alban's, crying 'A miracle!']
GLOSTER.
What means this noise?
Fellow, what miracle dost thou proclaim?
TOWNSMAN.
A miracle! A miracle!
SUFFOLK.
Come to the king, and tell him what miracle.
TOWNSMAN.
Forsooth, a blind man at Saint Alban's shrine,
Within this half hour, hath receiv'd his sight;
A man that ne'er saw in his life before.
KING.
Now, God be prais'd, that to believing souls
Gives light in darkness, comfort in despair!
[Enter the Mayor of Saint Alban's and his brethren,
bearing SIMPCOX, between two in a chair, SIMPCOX's
Wife following.]
CARDINAL.
Here comes the townsmen on procession,
To present your highness with the man.
KING HENRY.
Great is his comfort in this earthly vale,
Although by his sight his sin be multiplied.
GLOSTER.
Stand by, my masters.
Bring him near the king;
His highness' pleasure is to talk with him.
KING.
Good fellow, tell us here the circumstance,
That we for thee may glorify the Lord.
What, hast thou been long blind and now restor'd?
SIMPCOX.
Born blind, an 't please your grace.
WIFE.
Ay indeed was he.
SUFFOLK.
What woman is this?
WIFE.
His wife, an 't like your worship.
GLOSTER.
Hadst thou been his mother, thou couldst
have better told.
KING.
Where wert thou born?
SIMPCOX.
At Berwick in the north, an 't like your grace.
