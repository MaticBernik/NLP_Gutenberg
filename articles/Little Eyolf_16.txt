ASTA. Could I sew then? Fancy, I have forgotten it.
ALLMERS. Oh, you were such a little thing then.
ASTA. Yes, I was little then.
ALLMERS. And then, two years afterwards--when we lost your mother--then
again you sewed a big crape band on my sleeve.
ASTA. I thought it was the right thing to do.
ALLMERS. [Patting her hand.] Yes, yes, it was the right thing to do,
Asta. And then when we were left alone in the world, we two--. Are you
done already?
ASTA. Yes. [Putting together her sewing-materials.] It was really a
beautiful time for us, Alfred. We two alone.
ALLMERS. Yes, it was--though we had to toil so hard.
ASTA. You toiled.
ALLMERS. [With more life.] Oh, you toiled too, in your way, I can assure
you--[smiling]--my dear, faithful--Eyolf.
ASTA. Oh--you mustn't remind me of that stupid nonsense about the name.
ALLMERS. Well, if you had been a boy, you would have been called Eyolf.
ASTA. Yes, if! But when you began to go to college--. [Smiling
involuntarily.] I wonder how you could be so childish.
ALLMERS. Was it I that was childish?
ASTA. Yes, indeed, I think it was, as I look back upon it all. You were
ashamed of having no brother--only a sister.
ALLMERS. No, no, it was you, dear--you were ashamed.
ASTA. Oh yes, I too, perhaps--a little. And somehow or other I was sorry
for you--
ALLMERS. Yes, I believe you were. And then you hunted up some of my old
boy's clothes--
ASTA. Your fine Sunday clothes--yes. Do you remember the blue blouse and
knickerbockers?
ALLMERS. [His eyes dwelling upon her.] I remember so well how you looked
when you used to wear them.
ASTA. Only when we were at home, alone, though.
ALLMERS. And how serious we were, dear, and how mightily pleased with
ourselves. I always called you Eyolf.
ASTA. Oh, Alfred, I hope you have never told Rita this?
ALLMERS. Yes, I believe I did once tell her.
ASTA. Oh, Alfred, how could you do that?
ALLMERS. Well, you see--one tells one's wife everything--very nearly.
ASTA. Yes, I suppose one does.
ALLMERS. [As if awakening, clutches at his forehead and starts up.] Oh,
how can I sit here and--
ASTA. [Rising, looks sorrowfully at him.] What is the matter?
ALLMERS. He had almost passed away from me. He had passed quite away.
ASTA. Eyolf!
ALLMERS. Here I sat, living in these recollections--and he had no part
in them.
ASTA. Yes, Alfred--little Eyolf was behind it all.
ALLMERS. No, he was not. He slipped out of my memory--out of my
thoughts. I did not see him for a moment as we sat here talking. I
utterly forgot him all that time.
ASTA. But surely you must take some rest in your sorrow.
ALLMERS. No, no, no; that is just what I will not do! I must not--I
have no right--and no heart for it, either. [Going in great excitement
towards the right.] All my thoughts must be out there, where he lies
drifting in the depths!
