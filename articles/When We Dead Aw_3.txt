THE INSPECTOR.
[With a show of sympathy.] Oh--that is a pity. But after a few weeks'
stay at the Baths--you will quite get over that.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Looking up at him.] Tell me, Inspector--are any of your patients in the
habit of taking baths during the night?
THE INSPECTOR.
[Astonished.] During the night? No, I have never heard of such a thing.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Have you not?
THE INSPECTOR.
No, I don't know of any one so ill as to require such treatment.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Well, at any rate there is some one who is in the habit of walking about
the park by night?
THE INSPECTOR.
[Smiling and shaking his head.] No, Professor--that would be against the
rules.
MAIA.
[Impatiently.] Good Heavens, Rubek, I told you so this morning--you must
have dreamt it.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Drily.] Indeed? Must I? Thank you! [Turning to the INSPECTOR.] The fact
is, I got up last night--I couldn't sleep--and I wanted to see what sort
of night it was--
THE INSPECTOR.
[Attentively.] To be sure--and then--?
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
I looked out at the window--and caught sight of a white figure in there
among the trees.
MAIA.
[Smiling to the INSPECTOR.] And the Professor declares that the figure
was dressed in a bathing costume--
PROFESSOR RUBEK. --or something like it, I said. Couldn't distinguish
very clearly. But I am sure it was something white.
THE INSPECTOR.
Most remarkable. Was it a gentleman or a lady?
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
I could almost have sworn it was a lady. But then after it came another
figure. And that one was quite dark--like a shadow--.
THE INSPECTOR.
[Starting.] A dark one? Quite black, perhaps?
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Yes, I should almost have said so.
THE INSPECTOR.
[A light breaking in upon him.] And behind the white figure? Following
close upon her--?
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Yes--at a little distance--
THE INSPECTOR.
Aha! Then I think I can explain the mystery, Professor.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Well, what was it then?
MAIA.
[Simultaneously.] Was the professor really not dreaming?
THE INSPECTOR.
[Suddenly whispering, as he directs their attention towards the
background on the right.] Hush, if you please! Look there--don't speak
loud for a moment.
    [A slender lady, dressed in fine, cream-white cashmere, and
       followed by a SISTER OF MERCY in black, with a silver cross
       hanging by a chain on her breast, comes forward from behind
       the hotel and crosses the park towards the pavilion in front
       on the left.  Her face is pale, and its lines seem to have
       stiffened; the eyelids are drooped and the eyes appear as
       though they saw nothing.  Her dress comes down to her feet
       and clings to the body in perpendicular folds.  Over her head,
       neck, breast, shoulders and arms she wears a large shawl of
       white crape.  She keeps her arms crossed upon her breast.
       She carries her body immovably, and her steps are stiff and
       measured.  The SISTER's bearing is also measured, and she has
       the air of a servant.  She keeps her brown piercing eyes
       incessantly fixed upon the lady.  WAITERS, with napkins on
       their arms, come forward in the hotel doorway, and cast
       curious glances at the strangers, who take no notice of
       anything, and, without looking round, enter the pavilion.
