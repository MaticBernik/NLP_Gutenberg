What's here?                                                       150
    'Silvia, this night I will enfranchise thee.'
'Tis so; and here's the ladder for the purpose.
Why, Phaethon,--for thou art Merops' son,--
Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car,
And with thy daring folly burn the world?                          155
Wilt thou reach stars, because they shine on thee?
Go, base intruder! overweening slave!
Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates;
And think my patience, more than thy desert,
Is privilege for thy departure hence:                              160
Thank me for this more than for all the favours,
Which all too much I have bestow'd on thee.
But if thou linger in my territories
Longer than swiftest expedition
Will give thee time to leave our royal court,                      165
By heaven! my wrath shall far exceed the love
I ever bore my daughter or thyself.
Be gone! I will not hear thy vain excuse;
But, as thou lovest thy life, make speed from hence.    [_Exit._
_Val._ And why not death rather than living torment?               170
To die is to be banish'd from myself;
And Silvia is myself: banish'd from her,
Is self from self: a deadly banishment!
What light is light, if Silvia be not seen?
What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by?                              175
Unless it be to think that she is by,
And feed upon the shadow of perfection.
Except I be by Silvia in the night,
There is no music in the nightingale;
Unless I look on Silvia in the day,                                180
There is no day for me to look upon:
She is my essence; and I leave to be,
If I be not by her fair influence
Foster'd, illumined, cherish'd, kept alive.
I fly not death, to fly his deadly doom:                           185
Tarry I here, I but attend on death:
But, fly I hence, I fly away from life.
  _Enter PROTEUS and LAUNCE._
_Pro._ Run, boy, run, run, and seek him out.
_Launce._ Soho, soho!
_Pro._ What seest thou?                                            190
_Launce._ Him we go to find: there's not a hair on's
head but 'tis a Valentine.
_Pro._ Valentine?
_Val._ No.
_Pro._ Who then? his spirit?                                       195
_Val._ Neither.
_Pro._ What then?
_Val._ Nothing.
_Launce._ Can nothing speak? Master, shall I strike?
_Pro._ Who wouldst thou strike?                                    200
_Launce._ Nothing.
_Pro._ Villain, forbear.
_Launce._ Why, sir, I'll strike nothing: I pray you,--
_Pro._ Sirrah, I say, forbear. Friend Valentine, a word.
_Val._ My ears are stopt, and cannot hear good news,               205
So much of bad already hath possess'd them.
_Pro._ Then in dumb silence will I bury mine,
For they are harsh, untuneable, and bad.
_Val._ Is Silvia dead?
_Pro._ No, Valentine.                                              210
_Val._ No Valentine, indeed, for sacred Silvia.
Hath she forsworn me?
_Pro._ No, Valentine.
_Val._ No Valentine, if Silvia have forsworn me.
What is your news?                                                 215
_Launce._ Sir, there is a proclamation that you are vanished.
_Pro._ That thou art banished--O, that's the news!--
From hence, from Silvia, and from me thy friend.
_Val._ O, I have fed upon this woe already,
And now excess of it will make me surfeit.                         220
Doth Silvia know that I am banished?
