    _Bion._ He that has the two fair daughters: is't he you
    mean?
    _Tra._ Even he, Biondello.
    _Gre._ Hark you, sir; you mean not her to--
    _Tra._ Perhaps, him and her, sir: what have you to do?           220
    _Pet._ Not her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray.
    _Tra._ I love no chiders, sir. Biondello, let's away.
    _Luc._ Well begun, Tranio.
    _Hor._ Sir, a word ere you go;
    Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of, yea or no?             225
    _Tra._ And if I be, sir, is it any offence?
    _Gre._ No; if without more words you will get you hence.
    _Tra._ Why, sir, I pray, are not the streets as free
    For me as for you?
    _Gre._             But so is not she.
    _Tra._ For what reason, I beseech you?                           230
    _Gre._ For this reason, if you'll know,
    That she's the choice love of Signior Gremio.
    _Hor._ That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio.
    _Tra._ Softly, my masters! if you be gentlemen,
    Do me this right; hear me with patience.                         235
    Baptista is a noble gentleman,
    To whom my father is not all unknown;
    And were his daughter fairer than she is,
    She may more suitors have and me for one.
    Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers;                      240
    Then well one more may fair Bianca have:
    And so she shall; Lucentio shall make one,
    Though Paris came in hope to speed alone.
    _Gre._ What, this gentleman will out-talk us all!
    _Luc._ Sir, give him head: I know he'll prove a jade.            245
    _Pet._ Hortensio, to what end are all these words?
    _Hor._ Sir, let me be so bold as ask you,
    Did you yet ever see Baptista's daughter?
    _Tra._ No, sir; but hear I do that he hath two,
    The one as famous for a scolding tongue                          250
    As is the other for beauteous modesty.
    _Pet._ Sir, sir, the first's for me; let her go by.
    _Gre._ Yea, leave that labour to great Hercules;
    And let it be more than Alcides' twelve.
    _Pet._ Sir, understand you this of me in sooth:                  255
    The youngest daughter whom you hearken for
    Her father keeps from all access of suitors;
    And will not promise her to any man
    Until the elder sister first be wed:
    The younger then is free and not before.                         260
    _Tra._ If it be so, sir, that you are the man
    Must stead us all and me amongst the rest;
    And if you break the ice and do this feat,
    Achieve the elder, set the younger free
    For our access, whose hap shall be to have her                   265
    Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.
    _Hor._ Sir, you say well and well you do conceive;
    And since you do profess to be a suitor,
    You must, as we do, gratify this gentleman,
    To whom we all rest generally beholding.                         270
    _Tra._ Sir, I shall not be slack: in sign whereof,
    Please ye we may contrive this afternoon,
    And quaff carouses to our mistress' health,
    And do as adversaries do in law,
    Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.                   275
