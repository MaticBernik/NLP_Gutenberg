Mrs. Stockmann (who sits knitting). Do you sail soon, Captain Horster?
Horster. I expect to be ready to sail next week.
Mrs. Stockmann. I suppose you are going to America?
Horster. Yes, that is the plan.
Mrs. Stockmann. Then you won't be able to take part in the coming
election?
Horster. Is there going to be an election?
Billing. Didn't you know?
Horster. No, I don't mix myself up with those things.
Billing. But do you not take an interest in public affairs?
Horster. No, I don't know anything about politics.
Billing. All the same, one ought to vote, at any rate.
Horster. Even if one doesn't know anything about what is going on?
Billing. Doesn't know! What do you mean by that? A community is like a
ship; everyone ought to be prepared to take the helm.
Horster. Maybe that is all very well on shore; but on board ship it
wouldn't work.
Hovstad. It is astonishing how little most sailors care about what goes
on on shore.
Billing. Very extraordinary.
Dr. Stockmann. Sailors are like birds of passage; they feel equally at
home in any latitude. And that is only an additional reason for our
being all the more keen, Hovstad. Is there to be anything of public
interest in tomorrow's "Messenger"?
Hovstad. Nothing about municipal affairs. But the day after tomorrow I
was thinking of printing your article--
Dr. Stockmann. Ah, devil take it--my article! Look here, that must wait
a bit.
Hovstad. Really? We had just got convenient space for it, and I thought
it was just the opportune moment--
Dr. Stockmann. Yes, yes, very likely you are right; but it must wait
all the same. I will explain to you later. (PETRA comes in from the
hall, in hat and cloak and with a bundle of exercise books under her
arm.)
Petra. Good evening.
Dr. Stockmann. Good evening, Petra; come along.
(Mutual greetings; PETRA takes off her things and puts them down on a
chair by the door.)
Petra. And you have all been sitting here enjoying yourselves, while I
have been out slaving!
Dr. Stockmann. Well, come and enjoy yourself too!
Billing. May I mix a glass for you?
Petra (coming to the table). Thanks, I would rather do it; you always
mix it too strong. But I forgot, father--I have a letter for you. (Goes
to the chair where she has laid her things.)
Dr. Stockmann. A letter? From whom?
Petra (looking in her coat pocket). The postman gave it to me just as I
was going out.
Dr. Stockmann (getting up and going to her). And you only give to me
now!
Petra. I really had not time to run up again. There it is!
Dr. Stockmann (seizing the letter). Let's see, let's see, child! (Looks
at the address.) Yes, that's all right!
Mrs. Stockmann. Is it the one you have been expecting go anxiously,
Thomas?
Dr. Stockmann. Yes, it is. I must go to my room now and-- Where shall I
get a light, Katherine? Is there no lamp in my room again?
