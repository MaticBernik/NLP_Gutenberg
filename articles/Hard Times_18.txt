The latter part of this speech was addressed to Mr. Gradgrind, who
received it with a grave inclination of his head, and then remarked:
The only observation I will make to you, Jupe, in the way of influencing
your decision, is, that it is highly desirable to have a sound practical
education, and that even your father himself (from what I understand)
appears, on your behalf, to have known and felt that much.
The last words had a visible effect upon her.  She stopped in her wild
crying, a little detached herself from Emma Gordon, and turned her face
full upon her patron.  The whole company perceived the force of the
change, and drew a long breath together, that plainly said, she will
go!
Be sure you know your own mind, Jupe, Mr. Gradgrind cautioned her; I
say no more.  Be sure you know your own mind!
When father comes back, cried the girl, bursting into tears again after
a minutes silence, how will he ever find me if I go away!
You may be quite at ease, said Mr. Gradgrind, calmly; he worked out the
whole matter like a sum: you may be quite at ease, Jupe, on that score.
In such a case, your father, I apprehend, must find out Mr.
Thleary.  Thath my name, Thquire.  Not athamed of it.  Known all over
England, and alwayth paythe ith way.
Must find out Mr. Sleary, who would then let him know where you went.  I
should have no power of keeping you against his wish, and he would have
no difficulty, at any time, in finding Mr. Thomas Gradgrind of Coketown.
I am well known.
Well known, assented Mr. Sleary, rolling his loose eye.  Youre one of
the thort, Thquire, that keepth a prethiouth thight of money out of the
houthe.  But never mind that at prethent.
There was another silence; and then she exclaimed, sobbing with her hands
before her face, Oh, give me my clothes, give me my clothes, and let me
go away before I break my heart!
The women sadly bestirred themselves to get the clothes togetherit was
soon done, for they were not manyand to pack them in a basket which had
often travelled with them.  Sissy sat all the time upon the ground, still
sobbing, and covering her eyes.  Mr. Gradgrind and his friend Bounderby
stood near the door, ready to take her away.  Mr. Sleary stood in the
middle of the room, with the male members of the company about him,
exactly as he would have stood in the centre of the ring during his
daughter Josephines performance.  He wanted nothing but his whip.
The basket packed in silence, they brought her bonnet to her, and
smoothed her disordered hair, and put it on.  Then they pressed about
her, and bent over her in very natural attitudes, kissing and embracing
her: and brought the children to take leave of her; and were a
tender-hearted, simple, foolish set of women altogether.
Now, Jupe, said Mr. Gradgrind.  If you are quite determined, come!
