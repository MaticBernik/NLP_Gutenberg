    _Third Serv._ Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood,            55
    Scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds,
    And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep,
    So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.
    _Lord._ Thou art a lord and nothing but a lord:
    Thou hast a lady far more beautiful                               60
    Than any woman in this waning age.
    _First Serv._ And till the tears that she hath shed for thee
    Like envious floods o'er-run her lovely face,
    She was the fairest creature in the world;
    And yet she is inferior to none.                                  65
    _Sly._ Am I a lord? and have I such a lady?
    Or do I dream? or have I dream'd till now?
    I do not sleep: I see, I hear, I speak;
    I smell sweet savours and I feel soft things:
    Upon my life, I am a lord indeed                                  70
    And not a tinker nor Christophero Sly.
    Well, bring our lady hither to our sight;
    And once again, a pot o' the smallest ale.
    _Sec. Serv._ Will't please your mightiness to wash your hands?
    O, how we joy to see your wit restored!                           75
    O, that once more you knew but what you are!
    These fifteen years you have been in a dream;
    Or when you waked, so waked as if you slept.
    _Sly._ These fifteen years! by my fay, a goodly nap.
    But did I never speak of all that time?                           80
    _First Serv._ O, yes, my lord, but very idle words:
    For though you lay here in this goodly chamber,
    Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door;
    And rail upon the hostess of the house;
    And say you would present her at the leet,                        85
    Because she brought stone jugs and no seal'd quarts:
    Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket.
    _Sly._ Ay, the woman's maid of the house.
    _Third Serv._ Why, sir, you know no house nor no such maid,
    Nor no such men as you have reckon'd up,                          90
    As Stephen Sly and old John Naps of Greece
    And Peter Turph and Henry Pimpernell
    And twenty more such names and men as these
    Which never were nor no man ever saw.
    _Sly._ Now Lord be thanked for my good amends!                    95
    _All._ Amen.
    _Sly._ I thank thee: thou shalt not lose by it.
_Enter the_ Page _as a lady_, _attended_.
    _Page._ How fares my noble lord?
    _Sly._ Marry, I fare well; for here is cheer enough.
    Where is my wife?                                                100
    _Page._ Here, noble lord: what is thy will with her?
    _Sly._ Are you my wife and will not call me husband?
    My men should call me 'lord:' I am your good-man.
    _Page._ My husband and my lord, my lord and husband;
    I am your wife in all obedience.                                 105
    _Sly._ I know it well. What must I call her?
    _Lord._ Madam.
    _Sly._ Al'ce madam, or Joan madam?
    _Lord._ 'Madam,' and nothing else: so lords call ladies.
    _Sly._ Madam wife, they say that I have dream'd                  110
    And slept above some fifteen year or more.
