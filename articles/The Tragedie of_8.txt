[Footnote 3: _1st Q_. 'too much grieu'd and sallied flesh.' _Sallied_,
sullied: compare _sallets_, 67, 103. I have a strong suspicion that
_sallied_ and not _solid_ is the true word. It comes nearer the depth of
Hamlet's mood.]
[Footnote 4: Two months at the present moment.]
[Footnote 5: This is the word all the editors take: which is right, I do
not know; I doubt if either is. The word in _A Midsummer Night's Dream_,
act i. sc. 1--
    Belike for want of rain; which I could well
    Beteem them from the tempest of mine eyes--
I cannot believe the same word. The latter means _produce for_, as from
the place of origin. The word, in the sense necessary to this passage,
is not, so far as I know, to be found anywhere else. I have no
suggestion to make.]
[Footnote 6: From his mother he generalizes to _woman_. After having
believed in such a mother, it may well be hard for a man to believe in
any woman.]
[Footnote 7: _Q._ omits 'euen she.']
[Footnote 8: the going abroad among things.]

My Fathers Brother: but no more like my Father,
Then I to _Hercules_. Within a Moneth?
Ere yet the salt of most vnrighteous Teares
Had left the flushing of her gauled eyes,             [Sidenote: in her]
She married. O most wicked speed, to post[1]
With such dexterity to Incestuous sheets:
It is not, nor it cannot come to good,
But breake my heart, for I must hold my tongue.[2]
_Enter Horatio, Barnard, and Marcellus._
                                  [Sidenote: _Marcellus, and Bernardo._]
_Hor._ Haile to your Lordship.[3]
_Ham._ I am glad to see you well:
_Horatio_, or I do forget my selfe.
_Hor._ The same my Lord,
And your poore Seruant euer.
[Sidenote: 134] _Ham._ [4]Sir my good friend,
Ile change that name with you:[5]
And what make you from Wittenberg _Horatio_?[6]
_Marcellus._[7]
_Mar._ My good Lord.
_Ham._ I am very glad to see you: good euen Sir.[8]
But what in faith make you from _Wittemberge_?
_Hor._ A truant disposition, good my Lord.[9]
_Ham._ I would not haue your Enemy say so;[10]     [Sidenote: not heare]
Nor shall you doe mine eare that violence,[11]       [Sidenote: my eare]
[Sidenote: 134] To make it truster of your owne report
Against your selfe. I know you are no Truant:
But what is your affaire in _Elsenour_?
Wee'l teach you to drinke deepe, ere you depart.[12]
                                       [Sidenote: you for to drinke ere]
_Hor._ My Lord, I came to see your Fathers Funerall.
_Ham._ I pray thee doe not mock me (fellow Student) [Sidenote: pre thee]
I thinke it was to see my Mothers Wedding.         [Sidenote: was to my]
[Footnote 1: I suggest the pointing:
    speed! To post ... sheets!]
[Footnote 2: Fit moment for the entrance of his father's messengers.]
[Footnote 3: They do not seem to have been intimate before, though we
know from Hamlet's speech (134) that he had had the greatest respect for
Horatio. The small degree of doubt in Hamlet's recognition of his friend
is due to the darkness, and the unexpectedness of his appearance.]
