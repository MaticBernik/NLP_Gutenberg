    [_Exeunt Sec. Merchant, Angelo, Officer, and Ant. E._
_Dro. S._ To Adriana! that is where we dined,
Where Dowsabel did claim me for her husband:                       110
She is too big, I hope, for me to compass.
Thither I must, although against my will,
For servants must their masters' minds fulfil.    [_Exit._

_SCENE II. The house of _ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus_._
  _Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA._
_Adr._ Ah, Luciana, did he tempt thee so?
    Mightst thou perceive austerely in his eye
That he did plead in earnest? yea or no?
    Look'd he or red or pale, or sad or merrily?
What observation madest thou, in this case,                          5
Of his heart's meteors tilting in his face?
_Luc._ First he denied you had in him no right.
_Adr._ He meant he did me none; the more my spite.
_Luc._ Then swore he that he was a stranger here.
_Adr._ And true he swore, though yet forsworn he were.              10
_Luc._ Then pleaded I for you.
_Adr._                       And what said he?
_Luc._ That love I begg'd for you he begg'd of me.
_Adr._ With what persuasion did he tempt thy love?
_Luc._ With words that in an honest suit might move.
First he did praise my beauty, then my speech.                      15
_Adr._ Didst speak him fair?
_Luc._                      Have patience, I beseech.
_Adr._ I cannot, nor I will not, hold me still;
My tongue, though not my heart, shall have his will.
He is deformed, crooked, old, and sere,
Ill-faced, worse bodied, shapeless everywhere;                      20
Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
Stigmatical in making, worse in mind.
_Luc._ Who would be jealous, then, of such a one?
No evil lost is wail'd when it is gone.
_Adr._ Ah, but I think him better than I say,                       25
    And yet would herein others' eyes were worse.
Far from her nest the lapwing cries away:
    My heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse.
