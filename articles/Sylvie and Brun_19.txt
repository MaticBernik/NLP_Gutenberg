He meant _both_ of us, said Sylvie.
No, he didnt! Bruno persisted. cause he said bonnie, oo know!
Well, at any rate he _looked_ at us both, Sylvie maintained.
Well, then he _must_ have seen were not _both_ bonnie! Bruno
retorted. A-_course_ Im much uglier than _oo_! Didnt he mean
_Sylvie_, Mister Sir? he shouted over his shoulder, as he ran off.
But there was no use in replying, as he had already vanished round the
bend of the road. When we overtook him he was climbing a gate, and was
gazing earnestly into the field, where a horse, a cow, and a kid were
browsing amicably together. For its father, a _Horse_, he murmured to
himself. For its mother, a _Cow_. For their dear little child, a
_little_ Goat, is the most curiousest thing I ever seen in my world!
Brunos World! I pondered. Yes, I suppose every child has a world of
his ownand every man, too, for the matter of that. I wonder if _thats_
the cause for all the misunderstanding there is in Life?
That _must_ be Hunters farm! said Sylvie, pointing to a house on the
brow of the hill, led up to by a cart-road. Theres no other farm in
sight, _this_ way; and you _said_ we must be nearly there by this time.
I had _thought_ it, while Bruno was climbing the gate, but I couldnt
remember having _said_ it. However, Sylvie was evidently in the right.
Get down, Bruno, I said, and open the gate for us.
Its a good thing wes with oo, _isnt_ it, Mister Sir? said Bruno, as
we entered the field. That big dog might have bited oo, if ood been
alone! Oo neednt be _flightened_ of it! he whispered, clinging tight
to my hand to encourage me. It arent fierce!
Fierce! Sylvie scornfully echoed, as the doga magnificent
Newfoundlandthat had come galloping down the field to meet us, began
curveting round us, in gambols full of graceful beauty, and welcoming us
with short joyful barks. Fierce! Why, its as gentle as a lamb!
Itswhy, Bruno, dont you know it? Its
So it _are_! cried Bruno, rushing forwards and throwing his arms round
its neck. Oh, you _dear_ dog! And it seemed as if the two children
would never have done hugging and stroking it.
And how _ever_ did he get _here_? said Bruno. Ask him, Sylvie. I
doosnt know how.
And then began an eager talk in Doggee, which of course was lost upon
_me_; and I could only _guess_, when the beautiful creature, with a sly
glance at me, whispered something in Sylvies ear, that _I_ was now the
subject of conversation. Sylvie looked round laughingly.
He asked me who you are, she explained. And I said Hes our
_friend_. And he said Whats his name? And I said Its _Mister
Sir_. And he said Bosh!
What is Bosh! in Doggee? I enquired.
Its the same as in English, said Sylvie. Only, when a _dog_ says it,
its a sort of a whisper, thats half a _cough_ and half a _bark_. Nero,
say _Bosh!_
