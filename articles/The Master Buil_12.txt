MRS. SOLNESS.
Oh yes. There we have room and to spare. [To HILDA.] Sit down now, and
rest a little. [She goes out to the right.
     [HILDA, with her hands behind her back, strolls about the room
       and looks at various objects.  SOLNESS stands in front, beside
       the table, also with his hands behind his back, and follows
       her with his eyes.
HILDA.
[Stops and looks at him.] Have you several nurseries?
SOLNESS.
There are three nurseries in the house.
HILDA.
That's a lot. Then I suppose you have a great many children?
SOLNESS.
No. We have no child. But now you can be the child here, for the time
being.
HILDA.
For to-night, yes. I shall not cry. I mean to sleep as sound as a stone.
SOLNESS.
Yes, you must be very tired, I should think.
HILDA.
Oh no! But all the same--. It's so delicious to lie and dream.
SOLNESS.
Do you dream much of nights?
HILDA.
Oh yes! Almost always.
SOLNESS.
What do you dream about most?
HILDA.
I sha'n't tell you to-night. Another time perhaps.
     [She again strolls about the room, stops at the desk and turns
       over the books and papers a little.
SOLNESS.
[Approaching.] Are you searching for anything?
HILDA.
No, I am merely looking at all these things. [Turns.] Perhaps I mustn't?
SOLNESS.
Oh, by all means.
HILDA.
Is it you that writes in this great ledger?
SOLNESS.
No, it's my book-keeper.
HILDA.
Is it a woman?
SOLNESS.
[Smiles.] Yes.
HILDA.
One you employ here, in your office?
SOLNESS.
Yes.
HILDA.
Is she married?
SOLNESS.
No, she is single.
HILDA.
Oh, indeed!
SOLNESS.
But I believe she is soon going to be married.
HILDA.
That's a good thing for her.
SOLNESS.
But not such a good thing for me. For then I shall have nobody to help
me.
HILDA.
Can't you get hold of some one else who will do just as well?
SOLNESS.
Perhaps you would stay here and--and write in the ledger?
HILDA.
[Measures him with a glance.] Yes, I daresay! No, thank you--nothing of
that sort for me.
     [She again strolls across the room, and sits down on the
       rocking-chair.  SOLNESS too goes to the table.
HILDA.
[Continuing.] For there must surely be plenty of other thing to be done
here. [Looks smilingly at him.] Don't you think so, too?
SOLNESS.
Of course. First of all, I suppose, you want to make a round of the
shops, and get yourself up in the height of fashion.
HILDA.
[Amused.] No, I think I shall let that alone!
SOLNESS.
Indeed?
HILDA.
For you must know I have run through all my money.
SOLNESS.
[Laughs.] Neither trunk nor money, then?
HILDA.
Neither one nor the other. But never mind--it doesn't matter now.
SOLNESS.
Come now, I like you for that.
HILDA.
Only for that?
SOLNESS.
For that among other things. [Sits in the arm-chair.] Is your father
alive still?
HILDA.
Yes, father's alive.
SOLNESS.
Perhaps you are thinking of studying here?
HILDA.
