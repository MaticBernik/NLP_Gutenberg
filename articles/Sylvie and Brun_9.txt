It _may_ be the London air, I said, or it may be the hard workor my
rather lonely life: anyhow, Ive _not_ been feeling very well, lately.
But Elveston will soon set me up again. Arthurs prescriptionhes my
doctor, you know, and I heard from him this morningis plenty of ozone,
and new milk, and _pleasant society_!
Pleasant society? said Lady Muriel, with a pretty make-believe of
considering the question. Well, really I dont know where we can find
_that_ for you! We have so few neighbours. But new milk we _can_ manage.
Do get it of my old friend Mrs. Hunter, up there, on the hill-side. You
may rely upon the _quality_. And her little Bessie comes to school every
day, and passes your lodgings. So it would be very easy to send it.
Ill follow your advice, with pleasure, I said; and Ill go and
arrange about it tomorrow. I know Arthur will want a walk.
Youll find it quite an easy walkunder three miles, I think.
Well, now that weve settled that point, let me retort your own remark
upon yourself. I dont think _youre_ looking quite your best!
I daresay not, she replied in a low voice; and a sudden shadow seemed
to overspread her face. Ive had some troubles lately. Its a matter
about which Ive been long wishing to consult you, but I couldnt easily
write about it. Im _so_ glad to have this opportunity!
Do you think, she began again, after a minutes silence, and with a
visible embarrassment of manner most unusual in her, that a promise,
deliberately and solemnly given, is _always_ bindingexcept, of course,
where its fulfilment would involve some actual _sin_?
I cant think of any other exception at this moment, I said. That
branch of casuistry is usually, I believe, treated as a question of
truth and untruth
Surely that _is_ the principle? she eagerly interrupted. I always
thought the Bible-teaching about it consisted of such texts as _lie not
one to another_?
I have thought about that point, I replied; and it seems to me that
the essence of _lying_ is the intention of _deceiving_. If you give a
promise, fully _intending_ to fulfil it, you are certainly acting
truthfully _then_; and, if you afterwards break it, that does not
involve any _deception_. I cannot call it _untruthful_.
Another pause of silence ensued. Lady Muriels face was hard to read:
she looked pleased, I thought, but also puzzled; and I felt curious to
know whether her question had, as I began to suspect, some bearing on
the breaking off of her engagement with Captain (now Major) Lindon.
You have relieved me from a great fear, she said; but the thing is of
course _wrong_, somehow. What texts would _you_ quote, to prove it
wrong?
Any that enforce the payment of _debts_. If _A_ promises something to
_B_, _B_ has a claim upon _A_. And _A_s sin, if he breaks his promise,
seems to me more analogous to _stealing_ than to _lying_.
