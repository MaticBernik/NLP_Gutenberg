Y.M. Do you really believe that mere public opinion could force a timid
and peaceful man to--
O.M. Go to war? Yes--public opinion can force some men to do _anything_.
Y.M. _Anything_?
O.M. Yes--anything.
Y.M. I don't believe that. Can it force a right-principled man to do a
wrong thing?
O.M. Yes.
Y.M. Can it force a kind man to do a cruel thing?
O.M. Yes.
Y.M. Give an instance.
O.M. Alexander Hamilton was a conspicuously high-principled man.
He regarded dueling as wrong, and as opposed to the teachings of
religion--but in deference to _public opinion_ he fought a duel. He
deeply loved his family, but to buy public approval he treacherously
deserted them and threw his life away, ungenerously leaving them to
lifelong sorrow in order that he might stand well with a foolish world.
In the then condition of the public standards of honor he could not have
been comfortable with the stigma upon him of having refused to fight.
The teachings of religion, his devotion to his family, his kindness of
heart, his high principles, all went for nothing when they stood in the
way of his spiritual comfort. A man will do _anything_, no matter what
it is, _to secure his spiritual comfort_; and he can neither be forced
nor persuaded to any act which has not that goal for its object.
Hamilton's act was compelled by the inborn necessity of contenting his
own spirit; in this it was like all the other acts of his life, and
like all the acts of all men's lives. Do you see where the kernel of the
matter lies? A man cannot be comfortable without _his own_ approval.
He will secure the largest share possible of that, at all costs, all
sacrifices.
Y.M. A minute ago you said Hamilton fought that duel to get _public_
approval.
O.M. I did. By refusing to fight the duel he would have secured his
family's approval and a large share of his own; but the public approval
was more valuable in his eyes than all other approvals put together--in
the earth or above it; to secure that would furnish him the _most_
comfort of mind, the most _self_--approval; so he sacrificed all other
values to get it.
Y.M. Some noble souls have refused to fight duels, and have manfully
braved the public contempt.
O.M. They acted _according to their make_. They valued their principles
and the approval of their families _above_ the public approval. They
took the thing they valued _most_ and let the rest go. They took
what would give them the _largest_ share of _personal contentment and
approval_--a man _always_ does. Public opinion cannot force that kind
of men to go to the wars. When they go it is for other reasons. Other
spirit-contenting reasons.
Y.M. Always spirit-contenting reasons?
O.M. There are no others.
Y.M. When a man sacrifices his life to save a little child from a
burning building, what do you call that?
O.M. When he does it, it is the law of _his_ make. _He_ can't bear to
see the child in that peril (a man of a different make _could_), and so
he tries to save the child, and loses his life. But he has got what he
was after--_his own approval_.
