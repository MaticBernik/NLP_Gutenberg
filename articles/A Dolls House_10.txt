_Krogstad_ (_controlling himself_). Listen to me, Mrs. Helmer. If
necessary, I am prepared to fight for my small post in the Bank as if I
were fighting for my life.
_Nora_. So it seems.
_Krogstad_. It is not only for the sake of the money; indeed, that
weighs least with me in the matter. There is another reason--well, I may
as well tell you. My position is this. I daresay you know, like
everybody else, that once, many years ago, I was guilty of an
indiscretion.
_Nora_. I think I have heard something of the kind.
_Krogstad_. The matter never came into court; but every way seemed to be
closed to me after that. So I took to the business that you know of. I
had to do something; and, honestly, don't think I've been one of the
worst. But now I must cut myself free from all that. My sons are growing
up; for their sake I must try and win back as much respect as I can in
the town. This post in the Bank was like the first step up for me--and
now your husband is going to kick me downstairs again into the mud.
_Nora_. But you must believe me, Mr. Krogstad; it is not in my power to
help you at all.
_Krogstad_. Then it is because you haven't the will; but I have means to
compel you.
_Nora_. You don't mean that you will tell my husband that I owe you
money?
_Krogstad_. Hm!--suppose I were to tell him?
_Nora_. It would be perfectly infamous of you. (_Sobbing_.) To think of
his learning my secret, which has been my joy and pride, in such an
ugly, clumsy way--that he should learn it from you! And it would put me
in a horribly disagreeable position--
_Krogstad_. Only disagreeable?
_Nora_ (_impetuously_). Well, do it, then!--and it will be the worse for
you. My husband will see for himself what a blackguard you are, and you
certainly won't keep your post then.
_Krogstad_. I asked you if it was only a disagreeable scene at home that
you were afraid of?
_Nora_. If my husband does get to know of it, of course he will at once
pay you what is still owing, and we shall have nothing more to do with
you.
_Krogstad_ (_coming a step nearer_). Listen to me, Mrs. Helmer. Either
you have a very bad memory or you know very little of business. I shall
be obliged to remind you of a few details.
_Nora_. What do you mean?
_Krogstad_. When your husband was ill, you came to me to borrow two
hundred and fifty pounds.
_Nora_. I didn't know any one else to go to.
_Krogstad_. I promised to get you that amount--
_Nora_. Yes, and you did so.
_Krogstad_. I promised to get you that amount, on certain conditions.
Your mind was so taken up with your husband's illness, and you were so
anxious to get the money for your journey, that you seem to have paid no
attention to the conditions of our bargain. Therefore it will not be
amiss if I remind you of them. Now, I promised to get the money on the
security of a bond which I drew up.
