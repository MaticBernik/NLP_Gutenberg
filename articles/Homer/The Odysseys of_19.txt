<U+202D>  THE SEVENTEENTH BOOK OF HOMERS ODYSSEYS
<U+202D>  THE ARGUMENT
<U+202D>  Telemachus, returnd to town,
<U+202D>  Makes to his curious mother known,
<U+202D>  In part, his travels.  After whom
<U+202D>  Ulysses to the court doth come,
<U+202D>  In good Eumaus guide, and prest
<U+202D>  To witness of the Wooers feast;
<U+202D>  Whom, though twice ten years did bestow
<U+202D>  In far-off parts, his dog doth know.
<U+202D>  ANOTHER ARGUMENT
<U+202D>  _<U+03A1><U+03C9><U+0311>._
<U+202D>     Ulysses shows
<U+202D>        Through all disguise.
<U+202D>     Whom his dog knows;
<U+202D>        Who knowing dies.
<U+202D>  But when airs rosy birth, the morn, arose,
<U+202D>  Telemachus did for the town dispose
<U+202D>  His early steps; and took to his command
<U+202D>  His fair long lance, well-sorting with his hand,
<U+202D>  Thus parting with Eumaus:  Now, my friend,
<U+202D>  I must to town, lest too far I extend
<U+202D>  My mothers moan for me, who, till her eyes
<U+202D>  Mine own eyes witness, varies tears and cries
<U+202D>  Through all extremes.  Do then this charge of mine,
<U+202D>  And guide to town this hapless guest of thine,
<U+202D>  To beg elsewhere his further festival.
<U+202D>  Give they that please, I cannot give to all,
<U+202D>  Mine own wants take up for myself my pain.
<U+202D>  If it incense him, he the worst shall gain.
<U+202D>  The lovely truth I love, and must be plain.
<U+202D>     Alas, friend,  said his father,  nor do I
<U+202D>  Desire at all your further charity.
<U+202D>  Tis better beg in cities than in fields,
<U+202D>  And take the worst a beggars fortune yields.
<U+202D>  Nor am I apt to stay in swine-styes more,
<U+202D>  However; ever the great chief before
<U+202D>  The poor ranks must to evry step obey.
<U+202D>  But go; your man in my command shall sway,
<U+202D>  Anon yet too, by favour, when your fires
<U+202D>  Have comforted the cold heat age expires,
<U+202D>  And when the suns flame hath besides corrected
<U+202D>  The early air abroad, not being protected
<U+202D>  By these my bare weeds from the mornings frost,
<U+202D>  Which (if so much ground is to be engrost
<U+202D>  By my poor feet as you report) may give
<U+202D>  Too violent charge to th heat by which I live.
<U+202D>     This said, his son went on with spritely pace,
<U+202D>  And to the Wooers studied little grace.
<U+202D>  Arrivd at home, he gave his javlin stay
<U+202D>  Against a lofty pillar, and bold way
<U+202D>  Made further in.  When having so far gone
<U+202D>  That he transcended the fair porch of stone,
<U+202D>  The first by far that gave his entry eye
<U+202D>  Was nurse Euryclea;  who th embrodery
<U+202D>  Of stools there set was giving cushions fair;
<U+202D>  Who ran upon him, and her rapt repair
<U+202D>  Shed tears for joy.  About him gatherd round
<U+202D>  The other maids; his head and shoulders crownd
<U+202D>  With kisses and embraces.  From above
<U+202D>  The Queen herself came, like the Queen of Love,
<U+202D>  Or bright Diana; cast about her son
<U+202D>  Her kind embraces, with effusión
<U+202D>  Of loving tears; kissd both his lovely eyes,
<U+202D>  His cheeks, and forehead; and gave all supplies
<U+202D>  With this entreaty;  Welcome, sweetest light!
<U+202D>  I never had conceit to set quick sight
<U+202D>  On thee thus soon, when thy lovd fathers fame
<U+202D>  As far as Pylos did thy spirit inflame,
<U+202D>  In that search venturd all-unknown to me.
<U+202D>  O say, by what powr camst thou now to be
<U+202D>  Mine eyes dear object?  He returnd reply:
<U+202D>  Move me not now, when you my scape descry
<U+202D>  From imminent death, to think me fresh entrapt;
<U+202D>  The feard wound rubbing, felt before I scapt.
<U+202D>  Double not needless passion on a heart
<U+202D>  Whose joy so green is, and so apt t invert;
<U+202D>  But pure weeds putting on, ascend and take
<U+202D>  Your women with you, that ye all may make
<U+202D>  Vows of full hecatombs in sacred fire
<U+202D>  To all the Godheads, if their only Sire
<U+202D>  Vouchsafe revenge of guest-rites wrongd, which he
<U+202D>  Is to protect as being their Deity.
<U+202D>  My way shall be directed to the hall
<U+202D>  Of common concourse, that I thence may call
<U+202D>  A stranger, who from off the Pylian shore
<U+202D>  Came friendly with me; whom I sent before
<U+202D>  With all my soldiers, but in chief did charge
<U+202D>  Piraus with him, wishing him t enlarge
<U+202D>  His love to him at home, in best affair,
<U+202D>  And utmost honours, till mine own repair.
<U+202D>     Her son thus spoken, his words could not bear
<U+202D>  The wings too easily through her either ear,
<U+202D>  But putting pure weeds on, made vows entire
<U+202D>  Of perfect hecatombs in sacred fire
<U+202D>  To all the Deities, if their only Sire
<U+202D>  Vouchsafd revenge of guest-rites wrongd, which he
<U+202D>  Was to protect as being their Deity.
<U+202D>     Her son left house, in his fair hand his lance,
<U+202D>  His dogs attending; and, on evry glance
<U+202D>  His looks cast from them, Pallas put a grace
<U+202D>  That made him seem of the celestial race.
<U+202D>  Whom, come to concourse, evry man admird,
<U+202D>  About him throngd the Wooers, and desird
<U+202D>  All good to him in tongues, but in their hearts
<U+202D>  Most deep ills threatend to his most deserts.
<U+202D>  Of whose huge rout once free, he cast glad eye
<U+202D>  On some that, long before his infancy,
<U+202D>  Were with his father great and gracious,
<U+202D>  Grave Halitherses, Mentor, Antiphus:
<U+202D>  To whom he went, took seat by them, and they
<U+202D>  Inquird of all things since his parting day.
<U+202D>  To them Piraus came, and brought his guest
<U+202D>  Along the city thither, whom not least
<U+202D>  The prince respected, nor was long before
<U+202D>  He rose and met him.  The first word yet bore
<U+202D>  Piraus from them both; whose haste besought
<U+202D>  The prince to send his women to see brought
<U+202D>  The gifts from his house that Atrides gave,
<U+202D>  Which his own roofs, he thought, would better save.
<U+202D>     The wise prince answerd:  I can scarce conceive
<U+202D>  The way to these works.  If the Wooers reave
<U+202D>  By privy stratagem my life at home,
<U+202D>  I rather wish Piraus may become
<U+202D>  The master of them, than the best of these.
<U+202D>  But, if I sow in their fields of excess
<U+202D>  Slaughter and ruin, then thy trust employ,
<U+202D>  And to me joying bring thou those with joy.
<U+202D>     This said, he brought home his grief-practisd guest;
<U+202D>  Where both put off, both oild, and did invest
<U+202D>  Themselves in rich robes, washd, and sate, and eat.
<U+202D>  His mother, in a fair chair taking seat
<U+202D>  Directly opposite, her loom applied;
<U+202D>  Who, when her son and guest had satisfied
<U+202D>  Their appetites with feast, said:  O my son,
<U+202D>  You know that ever since your sire was won
<U+202D>  To go in Agamemnons guide to Troy,
<U+202D>  Attempting sleep, I never did enjoy
<U+202D>  One nights good rest, but made my quiet bed
<U+202D>  A sea blown-up with sighs, with tears still shed
<U+202D>  Embrewd and troubled; yet, though all your miss
<U+202D>  In your late voyage hath been made for this,
<U+202D>  That you might know th abode your father made.
<U+202D>  You shun to tell me what success you had.
<U+202D>  Now then, before the insolent access
<U+202D>  The Wooers straight will force on us, express
<U+202D>  What you have heard.  I will, said he,  and true.
<U+202D>  We came to Pylos, where the studious due
<U+202D>  That any father could afford his son,
<U+202D>  (But new-arrivd from some course he had run
<U+202D>  To an extreme length, in some voyage vowd),
<U+202D>  Nestor, the pastor of the people, showd
<U+202D>  To me arrivd, in turrets thrust-up high,
<U+202D>  Where not his brave sons were more lovd than I.
<U+202D>  Yet of th unconquerd ever-sufferer;
<U+202D>  Ulysses, never he could set his ear,
<U+202D>  Alive or dead, from any earthy man.
<U+202D>  But to the great Lacedamonian,
<U+202D>  Atrides, famous for his lance, he sent,
<U+202D>  With horse and chariots, me, to learn th event
<U+202D>  From his relation; where I had the view
<U+202D>  Of Argive Helen, whose strong beauties drew,
<U+202D>  By wills of Gods, so many Grecian states,
<U+202D>  And Trojans, under such laborious fates.
<U+202D>  Where Menelaus askd me, what affair
<U+202D>  To Lacedamon renderd my repair.
<U+202D>  I told him all the truth, who made reply:
<U+202D>  O deed of most abhorrd indecency!
<U+202D>  A sort of impotents attempt his bed
<U+202D>  Whose strength of mind hath cities levelléd!
<U+202D>  As to a lions den, when any hind
<U+202D>  Hath brought her young calves, to their rest inclind,
<U+202D>  When he is ranging hills, and herby dales,
<U+202D>  To make of feeders there his festivals,
<U+202D>  But, turning to his luster, calves and dam
<U+202D>  He shows abhorrd death, in his angers flame;
<U+202D>  So, should Ulysses find this rabble housd
<U+202D>  In his free turrets, courting his espousd,
<U+202D>  Foul death would fall them.  O, I would to Jove,
<U+202D>  Phobus, and Pallas, that, when he shall prove
<U+202D>  The broad report of his exhausted store
<U+202D>  True with his eyes, his nerves and sinews wore
<U+202D>  That vigour then that in the Lesbian towrs,
<U+202D>  Provokd to wrastle with the iron powrs
<U+202D>  Philomelides vaunted, he approvd;
<U+202D>  When down he hurld his challenger, and movd
<U+202D>  Huge shouts from all the Achives then in view.
<U+202D>  If, once come home, he all those forces drew
<U+202D>  About him there to work, they all were dead,
<U+202D>  And should find bitter his attempted bed.
<U+202D>  But what you ask and sue for, I, as far
<U+202D>  As I have heard the true-spoke mariner,
<U+202D>  Will tell directly, nor delude your ear:
<U+202D>  He told me that an island did ensphere,
<U+202D>  In much discomfort, great Laertes son;
<U+202D>  And that the Nymph Calypso, overrun
<U+202D>  With his affection, kept him in her caves,
<U+202D>  Where men, nor ship, of powr to brook the waves,
<U+202D>  Were near his convoy to his countrys shore,
<U+202D>  And where herself importund evermore
<U+202D>  His quiet stay; which not obtaind, by force
<U+202D>  She kept his person from all else recourse.
<U+202D>     This told Atrides, which was all he knew.
<U+202D>  Nor stayd I more, but from the Gods there blew
<U+202D>  A prosprous wind, that set me quickly here.
<U+202D>     This put his mother quite from all her cheer.
<U+202D>  When Theoclymenus the augur said:
<U+202D>     O woman, honourd with Ulysses bed,
<U+202D>  Your son, no doubt, knows clearly nothing more,
<U+202D>  Hear me yet speak, that can the truth uncore,
<U+202D>  Nor will be curious.  Jove then witness bear,
<U+202D>  And this thy hospitable table here,
<U+202D>  With this whole household of your blameless lord,
<U+202D>  That at this hour his royal feet are shord
<U+202D>  On his lovd country-earth, and that evn here
<U+202D>  Coming, or creeping, he will see the cheer
<U+202D>  These Wooers make, and in his souls field sow
<U+202D>  Seeds that shall thrive to all their overthrow.
<U+202D>  This, set a ship-board, I knew sorted thus,
<U+202D>  And cried it out to your Telemachus.
<U+202D>     Penelopé replied:  Would this would prove,
<U+202D>  You well should witness a most friendly love,
<U+202D>  And gifts such of me, as encountring Fame
<U+202D>  Should greet you with a blesséd mortals name.
<U+202D>  This mutual speech past, all the Wooers were
<U+202D>  Hurling the stone, and tossing of the spear,
<U+202D>  Before the palace, in the pavéd court,
<U+202D>  Where otherwhiles their petulant resort
<U+202D>  Sat plotting injuries.  But when the hour
<U+202D>  Of supper enterd, and the feeding powr
<U+202D>  Brought sheep from field, that filld up evry way
<U+202D>  With those that usd to furnish that purvey,
<U+202D>  Medon, the herald (who of all the rest
<U+202D>  Pleasd most the Wooers, and at evry feast
<U+202D>  Was ever near) said:  You whose kind consort
<U+202D>  Make the fair branches of the tree our court,
<U+202D>  Grace it within now, and your suppers take.
<U+202D>  You that for health, and fair contentions sake,
<U+202D>  Will please your minds, know, bodies must have meat;
<U+202D>  _Plays worse than idleness in times to eat._
<U+202D>     This said, all left, came in, cast by, on thrones
<U+202D>  And chairs, their garments.  Their provisións
<U+202D>  Were sheep, swine, goats, the chiefly-great and fat,
<U+202D>  Besides an ox that from the herd they gat.
<U+202D>  And now the king and herdsman, from the field,
<U+202D>  In good way were to town; twixt whom was held
<U+202D>  Some walking conference, which thus begun
<U+202D>  The good Eumaus:  Guest, your will was won,
<U+202D>  Because the prince commanded, to make way
<U+202D>  Up to the city, though I wishd your stay,
<U+202D>  And to have made you guardian of my stall;
<U+202D>  But I, in care and fear of what might fall
<U+202D>  In after-anger of the prince, forbore.
<U+202D>  _The checks of princes touch their subjects sore._
<U+202D>  But make we haste, the day is nearly ended,
<U+202D>  And cold airs still are in the even extended.
<U+202D>     I knowt,  said he,  consider all; your charge
<U+202D>  Is givn to one that understands at large.
<U+202D>  Haste then.  Hereafter, you shall lead the way;
<U+202D>  Afford your staff too, if it fit your stay,
<U+202D>  That I may use it; since you say our pass
<U+202D>  Is less friend to a weak foot than it was.
<U+202D>     Thus cast he on his neck his nasty scrip,
<U+202D>  All-patchd and torn; a cord, that would not slip
<U+202D>  For knots and bracks about the mouth of it,
<U+202D>  Made serve the turn; and then his swain did fit
<U+202D>  His forcd state with a staff.  Then plied they hard
<U+202D>  Their way to town, their cottage left in guard
<U+202D>  To swains and dogs.  And now Eumaus led
<U+202D>  The king along, his garments to a thread
<U+202D>  All-bare and burnd, and he himself hard bore
<U+202D>  Upon his staff, at all parts like a poor
<U+202D>  And sad old beggar.  But when now they got
<U+202D>  The rough highway, their voyage wanted not
<U+202D>  Much of the city, where a fount they reachd,
<U+202D>  From whence the town their choicest water fetchd,
<U+202D>  That ever overflowd, and curious art
<U+202D>  Was shown about it; in which three had part
<U+202D>  Whose names Neritus and Polyctor were,
<U+202D>  And famous Ithacus.  It had a sphere
<U+202D>  Of poplar, that ran round about the wall;
<U+202D>  And into it a lofty rock let fall
<U+202D>  Continual supply of cool clear stream.
<U+202D>  On whose top, to the Nymphs that were supreme
<U+202D>  In those parts loves, a stately altar rose,
<U+202D>  Where evry traveller did still impose
<U+202D>  Devoted sacrifice.  At this fount found
<U+202D>  These silly travellers a man renownd
<U+202D>  For guard of goats, which now he had in guide,
<U+202D>  Whose huge-stord herd two herdsmen kept beside,
<U+202D>  For all herds it excelld, and bred a feed
<U+202D>  For Wooers only.  He was Dolius seed,
<U+202D>  And calld Melanthius.  Who casting eye
<U+202D>  On these two there, he chid them terribly,
<U+202D>  And so past mean, that evn the wretched fate
<U+202D>  Now on Ulysses he did irritate.
<U+202D>  His fume to this effect he did pursue:
<U+202D>  Why so,tis now at all parts passing true,
<U+202D>  That ill leads ill, good evermore doth train
<U+202D>  With like his like.  Why, thou unenvied swain,
<U+202D>  Whither dost thou lead this same victless leaguer,
<U+202D>  This bane of banquets, this most nasty beggar,
<U+202D>  Whose sight doth make one sad, it so abhors?
<U+202D>  Who, with his standing in so many doors,
<U+202D>  Hath broke his back; and all his beggary tends
<U+202D>  To beg base crusts, but to no manly ends,
<U+202D>  As asking swords, or with activity
<U+202D>  To get a caldron.  Wouldst thou give him me,
<U+202D>  To farm my stable, or to sweep my yard,
<U+202D>  And bring browse to my kids, and that preferrd
<U+202D>  He should be at my keeping for his pains
<U+202D>  To drink as much whey as his thirsty veins
<U+202D>  Would still be swilling (whey made all his fees)
<U+202D>  His monstrous belly would oppress his knees.
<U+202D>  But he hath learnd to lead base life about,
<U+202D>  And will not work, but crouch among the rout
<U+202D>  For broken meat to cram his bursten gut.
<U+202D>  Yet this Ill say, and he will find it put
<U+202D>  In sure effect, that if he enters where
<U+202D>  Ulysses roofs cast shade, the stools will there
<U+202D>  About his ears fly, all the house will throw,
<U+202D>  And rub his ragged sides with cuffs enow.
<U+202D>     Past these reviles, his manless rudeness spurnd
<U+202D>  Divine Ulysses; who at no part turnd
<U+202D>  His face from him, but had his spirit fed
<U+202D>  With these two thoughts, if he should strike him dead
<U+202D>  With his bestowéd staff, or at his feet
<U+202D>  Make his direct head and the pavement meet.
<U+202D>  But he bore all, and entertaind a breast
<U+202D>  That in the strife of all extremes did rest.
<U+202D>     Eumaus, frowning on him, chid him yet,
<U+202D>  And, lifting up his hands to heavn, he set
<U+202D>  This bitter curse at him:  O you that bear
<U+202D>  Fair name to be the race of Jupiter,
<U+202D>  Nymphs of these fountains!  If Ulysses ever
<U+202D>  Burnd thighs to you, that, hid in fat, did never
<U+202D>  Fail your acceptance, of or lamb or kid,
<U+202D>  Grant this grace to me:  Let the man thus hid
<U+202D>  Shine through his dark fate, make some God his guide,
<U+202D>  That, to thee, goatherd, this same palates pride,  [1]
<U+202D>  Thou drivst afore thee, he may come and make
<U+202D>  The scattrings of the earth, and overtake
<U+202D>  Thy wrongs, with forcing thee to ever err
<U+202D>  About the city, hunted by his fear.
<U+202D>  And in the mean space by some slothful swains
<U+202D>  Let lousy sickness gnaw thy cattles veins.
<U+202D>     O Gods!  replied Melanthius,  what a curse
<U+202D>  Hath this dog barkd out, and can yet do worse!
<U+202D>  This man shall I have givn into my hands,
<U+202D>  When in a well-built ship to far-off lands
<U+202D>  I shall transport him, that, should I want here,
<U+202D>  My sale of him may find me victuals there.
<U+202D>  And, for Ulysses, would to heavn his joy
<U+202D>  The silver-bearing-bow God would destroy,
<U+202D>  This day, within his house, as sure as he
<U+202D>  The day of his return shall never see.
<U+202D>     This said, he left them going silent on;
<U+202D>  But he out-went them, and took straight upon
<U+202D>  The palace-royal, which he enterd straight,
<U+202D>  Sat with the Wooers, and his trenchers freight
<U+202D>  The carvers gave him of the flesh there vented,
<U+202D>  But bread the revrend butleress presented.
<U+202D>  He took against Eurymachus his place,
<U+202D>  Who most of all the Wooers gave him grace.
<U+202D>  And now Ulysses and his swain got near,
<U+202D>  When round about them visited their ear
<U+202D>  The hollow harps delicious-stricken string,
<U+202D>  To which did Phemius, near the Wooers, sing.
<U+202D>     Then by the hand Ulysses took his swain,
<U+202D>  And said:  Eumaus, one may here see plain,
<U+202D>  In many a grace, that Laertiades
<U+202D>  Built here these turrets, and,mongst others these,
<U+202D>  His whole court armd with such a goodly wall,
<U+202D>  The cornice, and the cope, majestical,
<U+202D>  His double gates, and turrets, built too strong
<U+202D>  For force or virtue ever to expugn.
<U+202D>  I know the feasters in it now abound,
<U+202D>  Their cates cast such a savour; and the sound
<U+202D>  The harp gives argues an accomplishd feast.
<U+202D>  _The Gods made music banquets dearest guest._
<U+202D>     These things,  said he,  your skill may tell with ease,
<U+202D>  Since you are gracd with greater knowledges.
<U+202D>  But now consult we how these works shall sort,
<U+202D>  If you will first approach this praiséd court,
<U+202D>  And see these Wooers, I remaining here;
<U+202D>  Or I shall enter, and yourself forbear?
<U+202D>  But be not you too tedious in your stay,
<U+202D>  Lest thrust ye be and buffeted away.
<U+202D>  _Brain hath no fence for blows;_ look to t I pray.
<U+202D>     You speak to one that comprehends, said he,
<U+202D>  Go you before, and here adventure me.
<U+202D>  I have of old been usd to cuffs and blows;
<U+202D>  My mind is hardend, having borne the throes
<U+202D>  Of many a sour event in waves and wars,
<U+202D>  Where knocks and buffets are no foreigners.
<U+202D>  And this same harmful belly by no mean
<U+202D>  The greatest abstinent can ever wean.
<U+202D>  _Men suffer much bane by the bellys rage;_
<U+202D>  For whose sake ships in all their equipage
<U+202D>  Are armd, and set out to th untamed seas,
<U+202D>  Their bulks full-fraught with ills to enemies.
<U+202D>  Such speech they changd; when in the yard there lay
<U+202D>  A dog, calld Argus, which, before his way
<U+202D>  Assumd for Ilion, Ulysses bred,
<U+202D>  Yet stood his pleasure then in little stead,
<U+202D>  As being too young, but, growing to his grace,
<U+202D>  Young men made choice of him for evry chace,
<U+202D>  Or of their wild goats, of their hares, or harts.
<U+202D>  But his king gone, and he, now past his parts,
<U+202D>  Lay all abjectly on the stables store,
<U+202D>  Before the oxstall, and mules stable door,
<U+202D>  To keep the clothes cast from the peasants hands,
<U+202D>  While they laid compass on Ulysses lands,
<U+202D>  The dog, with ticks (unlookd-to) overgrown.
<U+202D>  But by this dog no sooner seen but known
<U+202D>  Was wise Ulysses, who new-enterd there,
<U+202D>  Up went his dogs laid ears, and, coming near,
<U+202D>  Up he himself rose, fawnd, and waggd his stern,
<U+202D>  Couchd close his ears, and lay so; nor discern  [2]
<U+202D>  Could evermore his dear-lovd lord again.
<U+202D>  Ulysses saw it, nor had powr t abstain
<U+202D>  From shedding tears; which (far-off seeing his swain)
<U+202D>  He dried from his sight clean; to whom he thus
<U+202D>  His grief dissembled:  Tis miraculous,
<U+202D>  That such a dog as this should have his lair
<U+202D>  On such a dunghill, for his form is fair.
<U+202D>  And yet, I know not, if there were in him
<U+202D>  Good pace, or parts, for all his goodly limb;
<U+202D>  Or he livd empty of those inward things,
<U+202D>  As are those trencher-beagles tending kings,
<U+202D>  Whom for their pleasures, or their glorys, sake,
<U+202D>  Or fashion, they into their favour take.
<U+202D>     This dog,  said he,  was servant to one dead
<U+202D>  A huge time since.  But if he bore his head,
<U+202D>  For form and quality, of such a height,
<U+202D>  As when Ulysses, bound for th Ilion fight,
<U+202D>  Or quickly after, left him, your rapt eyes
<U+202D>  Would then admire to see him use his thighs
<U+202D>  In strength and swiftness.  He would nothing fly,
<U+202D>  Nor anything let scape.  If once his eye
<U+202D>  Seizd any wild beast, he knew straight his scent;
<U+202D>  Go where he would, away with him he went.
<U+202D>  Nor was there ever any savage stood
<U+202D>  Amongst the thickets of the deepest wood
<U+202D>  Long time before him, but he pulld him down;
<U+202D>  As well by that true hunting to be shown
<U+202D>  In such vast coverts, as for speed of pace
<U+202D>  In any open lawn.  For in deep chace
<U+202D>  He was a passing-wise and well-nosd hound.
<U+202D>  And yet is all this good in him uncrownd
<U+202D>  With any grace here now, nor he more fed
<U+202D>  Than any errant cur.  His king is dead,
<U+202D>  Far from his country; and his servants are
<U+202D>  So negligent they lend his hound no care.
<U+202D>  _Where masters rule not, but let men alone,
<U+202D>  You never there see honest service done.
<U+202D>  That mans half-virtue Jove takes quite away,
<U+202D>  That once is sun-burnt with the servile day._
<U+202D>     This said, he enterd the well-builded-towrs,
<U+202D>  Up bearing right upon the glorious Wooers,
<U+202D>  And left poor Argus dead; his lords first sight
<U+202D>  Since that time twenty years bereft his light.
<U+202D>     Telemachus did far the first behold
<U+202D>  Eumaus enter, and made signs he should
<U+202D>  Come up to him.  He, noting, came, and took
<U+202D>  On earth his seat.  And then the master-cook
<U+202D>  Servd in more banquet; of which, part he set
<U+202D>  Before the Wooers, part the prince did get,
<U+202D>  Who sate alone, his table placd aside;
<U+202D>  To which the herald did the bread divide.
<U+202D>     After Eumaus, enterd straight the king,  [3]
<U+202D>  Like to a poor and heavy aged thing,
<U+202D>  Bore hard upon his staff, and was so clad
<U+202D>  As would have made his mere beholder sad.
<U+202D>  Upon the ashen floor his limbs he spread,
<U+202D>  And gainst a cypress-threshold stayd his head,
<U+202D>  The tree wrought smooth, and in a line direct
<U+202D>  Tried by the plumb and by the architect.
<U+202D>  The prince then bade the herdsman give him bread,
<U+202D>  The finest there, and see that prostrated
<U+202D>  At-all-parts plight of his givn all the cheer
<U+202D>  His hands could turn to:  Take,  said he,  and bear
<U+202D>  These cates to him, and bid him beg of all
<U+202D>  These Wooers here, and to their festival
<U+202D>  Bear up with all the impudence he can;
<U+202D>  _Bashful behaviour fits no needy man._
<U+202D>     He heard, and did his will.  Hold guest,  said he,
<U+202D>  Telemachus commends these cates to thee,
<U+202D>  Bids thee bear up, and all these Wooers implore.
<U+202D>  _Wit must make impudent whom Fate makes poor._
<U+202D>     O Jove,  said he,  do my poor prayrs the grace
<U+202D>  To make him blessedst of the mortal race,
<U+202D>  And evry thought now in his genrous heart
<U+202D>  To deeds that further my desires convert.
<U+202D>     Thus took he in with both his hands his store,
<U+202D>  And in the uncouth scrip, that lay before
<U+202D>  His ill-shod feet, reposd it; whence he fed
<U+202D>  All time the music to the feasters playd.
<U+202D>  Both jointly ending, then began the Wooers
<U+202D>  To put in old act their tumultuous powrs;
<U+202D>  When Pallas standing close did prompt her friend,
<U+202D>  To prove how far the bounties would extend
<U+202D>  Of those proud Wooers; so, to let him try
<U+202D>  Who most, who least, had learnd humanity.
<U+202D>  However, no thought touchd Minervas mind,
<U+202D>  That anyone shouldscape his wreak designd.
<U+202D>  He handsomely became all, crept about
<U+202D>  To evry Wooer, held a forcd hand out,
<U+202D>  And all his work did in so like a way,
<U+202D>  As he had practisd begging many a day.
<U+202D>  And though they knew all beggars could do this,
<U+202D>  Yet they admird it as no deed of his;
<U+202D>  Though far from thought of other, usd expence
<U+202D>  And pity to him, who he was, and whence,
<U+202D>  Inquiring mutually.  Melanthius then:
<U+202D>  Hear me, ye Wooers of the far-famd queen,
<U+202D>  About this beggar.  I have seen before
<U+202D>  This face of his; and know for certain more,
<U+202D>  That this swain brought him hither.  What he is,
<U+202D>  Or whence he came, flies me.  Reply to this
<U+202D>  Antinous made, and mockd Eumaus thus:
<U+202D>     O thou renownéd herdsman, why to us
<U+202D>  Broughtst thou this beggar?  Serves it not our hands;
<U+202D>  That other land-leapers, and cormorands,
<U+202D>  Profane poor knaves, lie on us, unconducted,
<U+202D>  But you must bring them?  So amiss instructed
<U+202D>  Art thou in course of thrift, as not to know
<U+202D>  Thy lords goods wrackd in this their overflow?
<U+202D>  Which thinkst thou nothing, that thou callst in these?
<U+202D>     Eumaus answerd:  Though you may be wise,
<U+202D>  You speak not wisely.  Who calls in a guest
<U+202D>  That is a guest himself?  None call to feast
<U+202D>  Other than men that are of public use,
<U+202D>  Prophets, or poets, whom the Gods produce,
<U+202D>  Physicians for mens ills, or architects.
<U+202D>  Such men the boundless earth affords respects
<U+202D>  Bounded in honour, and may call them well.
<U+202D>  But poor men who calls?  Who doth so excell
<U+202D>  In others good to do himself an ill?
<U+202D>  But all Ulysses servants have been still
<U+202D>  Eyesores in your way more than all that woo,
<U+202D>  And chiefly I.  But what care I for you,
<U+202D>  As long as these roofs hold as thralls to none
<U+202D>  The wise Penelope and her god-like son?
<U+202D>     Forbear,  said he,  and leave this tongues bold ill.
<U+202D>  Antinous uses to be crossing still,
<U+202D>  And give sharp words; his blood that humour bears,
<U+202D>  To set men still together by the ears.
<U+202D>  But,  turning then t Antinous,  O,  said he,
<U+202D>  You entertain a fathers care of me,
<U+202D>  To turn these eating guests out.  Tis advice
<U+202D>  Of needful use for my poor faculties,
<U+202D>  But God doth not allow this; there must be
<U+202D>  Some care of poor men in humanity.
<U+202D>  What you yourselves take, give; I not envy,
<U+202D>  But give command that hospitality
<U+202D>  Be givn all strangers.  Nor shall my powrs fear,
<U+202D>  If this mood in me reach my mothers ear;
<U+202D>  Much less the servants, that are here to see
<U+202D>  Ulysses house kept in his old degree.
<U+202D>  But you bear no such mind, your wits more cast
<U+202D>  To fill yourself than let another taste.
<U+202D>     Antinous answerd him:  Brave-spoken man!
<U+202D>  Whose minds free fire see checkd no virtue can.
<U+202D>  If all we Wooers here would give as much
<U+202D>  As my mind serves, his  [4]  largess should be such
<U+202D>  As would for three months serve his far-off way
<U+202D>  From troubling your house with more cause of stay.
<U+202D>     This said, he took a stool up, that did rest,
<U+202D>  Beneath the board, his spangled feet at feast,
<U+202D>  And offerd at him; but the rest gave all,
<U+202D>  And filld his fulsome scrip with festival.
<U+202D>  And so Ulysses for the present was,
<U+202D>  And for the future, furnishd, and his pass
<U+202D>  Bent to the door to eat.  Yet could not leave
<U+202D>  Antinous so, but said:  Do you too give,
<U+202D>  Lovd lord; your presence makes a show to me
<U+202D>  As you not worst were of the company,
<U+202D>  But best, and so much that you seem the king,
<U+202D>  And therefore you should give some better thing
<U+202D>  Than bread, like others.  I will spread your praise
<U+202D>  Through all the wide world, that have in my days
<U+202D>  Kept house myself, and trod the wealthy ways
<U+202D>  Of other men evn to the title Blest;
<U+202D>  And often have I givn an erring guest
<U+202D>  (How mean soever) to the utmost gain
<U+202D>  Of what he wanted, kept whole troops of men,
<U+202D>  And had all other comings in, with which
<U+202D>  Men live so well, and gain the fame of rich.
<U+202D>  Yet Jove consumd all; he would have it so;
<U+202D>  To which, his mean was this:  He made me go
<U+202D>  Far off, for Egypt, in the rude consort
<U+202D>  Of all-ways-wandring pirates, where, in port,
<U+202D>  I bade my lovd men draw their ships ashore,
<U+202D>  And dwell amongst them; sent out some t explore
<U+202D>  Up to the mountains, who, intemperate,
<U+202D>  And their inflamd bloods bent to satiate,
<U+202D>  Foragd the rich fields, hald the women thence,
<U+202D>  And unweand children, with the foul expence
<U+202D>  Both of their fames and bloods.  The cry then flew
<U+202D>  Straight to the city; and the great fields grew
<U+202D>  With horse and foot, and flamd with iron arms;
<U+202D>  When Jove (that breaks the thunder in alarms)
<U+202D>  An ill flight cast amongst my men; not one
<U+202D>  Inspird with spirit to stand, and turn upon
<U+202D>  The fierce pursuing foe; and therefore stood
<U+202D>  Their ill fate thick about them; some in blood,
<U+202D>  And some in bondage; toils led by constraint
<U+202D>  Fastning upon them.  Me along they sent
<U+202D>  To Cyprus with a stranger-prince they met,
<U+202D>  Dmetor Iasides, who th imperial seat
<U+202D>  Of that sweet island swayd in strong command.
<U+202D>  And thus feel I here needs contemned hand.
<U+202D>     And what God sent,  said he,  this suffring bane
<U+202D>  To vex our banquet?  Stand off, nor profane
<U+202D>  My board so boldly, lest I show thee here
<U+202D>  Cyprus and Egypt made more sour than there.
<U+202D>  You are a saucy set-facd vagabond.
<U+202D>  About with all you go, and they, beyond
<U+202D>  Discretion, give thee, since they find not here
<U+202D>  The least proportion set down to their cheer.
<U+202D>  But evry fountain hath his under-floods.
<U+202D>  _It is no bounty to give others goods._
<U+202D>     O Gods,  replied Ulysses,  I see now,
<U+202D>  You bear no soul in this your goodly show.
<U+202D>  Beggars at your board, I perceive, should get
<U+202D>  Scarce salt from your hands, if themselves brought meat;
<U+202D>  Since, sitting where anothers board is spread,
<U+202D>  That flows with feast, not to the broken bread
<U+202D>  Will your allowance reach.  Nay then,  said he,
<U+202D>  And lookd austerely,  if so saucy be
<U+202D>  Your sufferd language, I suppose, that clear
<U+202D>  You shall not scape without some broken cheer.
<U+202D>     Thus rapt he up a stool, with which he smit
<U+202D>  The kings right shoulder, twixt his neck and it.
<U+202D>  He stood him like a rock.  Antinous dart
<U+202D>  Nor stirrd Ulysses; who in his great heart
<U+202D>  Deep ills projected, which, for time yet, close
<U+202D>  He bound in silence, shook his head, and went
<U+202D>  Out to the entry, where he then gave vent
<U+202D>  To his full scrip, sat on the earth, and eat,
<U+202D>  And talkd still to the Wooers:  Hear me yet,
<U+202D>  Ye Wooers of the Queen.  It never grieves
<U+202D>  A man to take blows, where for sheep, or beeves,
<U+202D>  Or other main possessions, a man fights;
<U+202D>  But for his harmful belly this man smites,
<U+202D>  Whose love to many a man breeds many a woe.
<U+202D>  And if the poor have Gods, and Furies too,
<U+202D>  Before Antinous wear his nuptial wreath,
<U+202D>  He shall be worn upon the dart of death.
<U+202D>     Harsh guest,  said he,  sit silent at your meat,
<U+202D>  Or seek your desprate plight some safer seat,
<U+202D>  Lest by the hands or heels youths drag your years,
<U+202D>  And rend your rotten rags about your ears.
<U+202D>     This made the rest as highly hate his folly,
<U+202D>  As he had violated something holy.
<U+202D>  When one, evn of the proudest, thus began:
<U+202D>     Thou dost not nobly, thus to play the man
<U+202D>  On such an errant wretch.  O ill disposd!
<U+202D>  Perhaps some sacred Godhead goes enclosd
<U+202D>  Evn in his abject outside; for the Gods
<U+202D>  Have often visited these rich abodes
<U+202D>  Like such poor stranger pilgrims, since their powrs
<U+202D>  (Being always shapeful) glide through towns and towrs,
<U+202D>  Observing, as they pass still, who they be
<U+202D>  That piety love, and who impiety.
<U+202D>     This all men said, but he held sayings cheap.
<U+202D>  And all this time Telemachus did heap
<U+202D>  Sorrow on sorrow on his beating heart,
<U+202D>  To see his father stricken; yet let part
<U+202D>  No tear to earth, but shook his head, and thought
<U+202D>  As deep as those ills that were after wrought.
<U+202D>     The Queen now, hearing of her poor guests stroke,
<U+202D>  Said to her maid (as to her Wooer she spoke),
<U+202D>  I wish the famous-for-his-bow, the Sun,
<U+202D>  Would strike thy heart so.  Her wish, thus begun,
<U+202D>  Her lady, fair Eurynome, pursued
<U+202D>  Her execration, and did thus conclude:
<U+202D>  So may our vows call down from heavn his end,
<U+202D>  And let no one life of the rest extend
<U+202D>  His life till morning.   O Eurynomé,
<U+202D>  Replied the Queen,  may all Gods speak in thee,
<U+202D>  For all the Wooers we should rate as foes,
<U+202D>  Since all their weals they place in others woes!
<U+202D>  But this Antinous we past all should hate,
<U+202D>  As one resembling black and cruel Fate.
<U+202D>  A poor strange wretch beggd here, compelld by need,
<U+202D>  Askd all, and evry one gave in his deed,
<U+202D>  Filld his sad scrip, and easd his heavy wants,
<U+202D>  Only this man bestowd unmanly taunts,
<U+202D>  And with a cruel blow, his force let fly,
<U+202D>  Twixt neck and shoulders showd his charity.
<U+202D>  These minds, above, she and her maids did show,
<U+202D>  While, at his scrip, Ulysses sat below.
<U+202D>  In which time she Eumaus calld, and said:
<U+202D>  Go, good Eumaus, and see soon conveyd
<U+202D>  The stranger to me; bid him come and take
<U+202D>  My salutations for his welcomes sake,
<U+202D>  And my desire serve, if he hath not heard
<U+202D>  Or seen distressd Ulysses, who hath errd
<U+202D>  Like such a man, and therefore chance may fall
<U+202D>  He hath by him been met and spoke withal?
<U+202D>     O Queen,  said he,  I wish to heavn your ear
<U+202D>  Were quit of this unrevrend noise you hear
<U+202D>  From these rude Wooers, when I bring the guest;
<U+202D>  Such words your ear would let into your breast
<U+202D>  As would delight it to your very heart.
<U+202D>  Three nights and days I did my roof impart
<U+202D>  To his fruition (for he came to me
<U+202D>  The first of all men since he fled the sea)
<U+202D>  And yet he had not givn a perfect end
<U+202D>  To his relation of what woes did spend
<U+202D>  The spite of Fate on him, but as you see  [5]
<U+202D>  A singer, breathing out of Deity
<U+202D>  Love-kindling lines, when all men seated near
<U+202D>  Are rapt with endless thirst to ever hear;
<U+202D>  So sweetend he my bosom at my meat,
<U+202D>  Affirming that Ulysses was in Crete,
<U+202D>  Where first the memories of Minos were,
<U+202D>  A guest to him there dwelling then, as dear
<U+202D>  As his true father; and from thence came he
<U+202D>  Tird on with sorrows, tossd from sea to sea,
<U+202D>  To cast himself in dust, and tumble here,
<U+202D>  At Wooers feet, for blows and broken cheer.
<U+202D>  But of Ulysses, where the Thesprots dwell,
<U+202D>  A wealthy people, Fame, he says, did tell
<U+202D>  The still survival; who his native light
<U+202D>  Was bound for now, with treasure infinite.
<U+202D>     Call him,  said she,  that he himself may say
<U+202D>  This over to me.  We shall soon have way
<U+202D>  Givn by the Wooers; they, as well at gate,
<U+202D>  As set within doors, use to recreate
<U+202D>  Their high-fed spirits.  As their humours lead
<U+202D>  They follow; and may well; for still they tread
<U+202D>  Unchargd ways here, their own wealth lying unwasted
<U+202D>  In poor-kept houses, only something tasted
<U+202D>  Their bread and wine is by their household swains,
<U+202D>  But they themselves let loose continual reins
<U+202D>  To our expenses, making slaughter still
<U+202D>  Of sheep, goats, oxen, feeding past their fill,
<U+202D>  And vainly lavishing our richest wine;
<U+202D>  All these extending past the sacred line,
<U+202D>  For here lives no man like Ulysses now
<U+202D>  To curb these reins.  But should he once show
<U+202D>  His country-light his presence, he and his
<U+202D>  Would soon revenge these Wooers injuries.
<U+202D>     This said, about the house, in echoes round,
<U+202D>  Her sons strange neesings made a horrid sound;  [6]
<U+202D>  At which the Queen yet laughd, and said:  Go call
<U+202D>  The stranger to me.  Heardst thou not, to all
<U+202D>  My words last utterd, what a neesing brake
<U+202D>  From my Telemachus?  From whence I make,
<U+202D>  This sure conclusion:  That the death and fate
<U+202D>  Of evry Wooer here is near his date.
<U+202D>  Call, then, the guest, and if he tell as true
<U+202D>  What I shall ask him, coat, cloak, all things new,
<U+202D>  These hands shall yield him.  This said, down he went,
<U+202D>  And told Ulysses,  that the Queen had sent
<U+202D>  To call him to her, that she might enquire
<U+202D>  About her husband what her sad desire
<U+202D>  Urgd her to ask; and, if she found him true,
<U+202D>  Both coat, and cassock (which he needed) new
<U+202D>  Her hands would put on him; and that the bread,
<U+202D>  Which now he beggd amongst the common tread,
<U+202D>  Should freely feed his hunger now from her,
<U+202D>  Who all he wishd would to his wants prefer.
<U+202D>     His answer was:  I will with fit speed tell
<U+202D>  The whole truth to the Queen; for passing well
<U+202D>  I know her lord, since he and I have shard
<U+202D>  In equal sorrows.  But I much am scard
<U+202D>  With this rude multitude of Wooers here,
<U+202D>  The rage of whose pride smites heavns brazen sphere.
<U+202D>  Of whose rout when one struck me for no fault,
<U+202D>  Telemachus nor none else turnd th assault
<U+202D>  From my poor shoulders.  Therefore, though she haste,
<U+202D>  Beseech the Queen her patience will see past
<U+202D>  The days broad light, and then may she enquire.
<U+202D>  Tis but my closer pressing to the fire
<U+202D>  In th evnings cold, because my weeds, you know,
<U+202D>  Are passing thin; for I made bold to show
<U+202D>  Their bracks to you, and prayd your kind supply.
<U+202D>     He heard, and hasted; and met instantly
<U+202D>  The Queen upon the pavement in his way,
<U+202D>  Who askd:  What!  Bringst thou not?  What cause of stay
<U+202D>  Find his austere supposes?  Takes he fear
<U+202D>  Of th unjust Wooers?  Or thus hard doth bear
<U+202D>  On any other doubt the house objects?
<U+202D>  He does me wrong, and gives too nice respects
<U+202D>  To his feard safety.   He does right,  said he,
<U+202D>  And what he fears should move the policy
<U+202D>  Of any wise one; taking care to shun
<U+202D>  The violent Wooers.  He bids bide, till sun
<U+202D>  Hath hid his broad light.  And, believe it, Queen,
<U+202D>  Twill make your best course, since you two, unseen,
<U+202D>  May pass th encounter; you to speak more free,
<U+202D>  And he your ear gain less distractedly.
<U+202D>     The guest is wise,  said she,  and well doth give
<U+202D>  The right thought use.  Of all the men that live,
<U+202D>  Life serves none such as these proud Wooers are,
<U+202D>  To give a good man cause to use his care.
<U+202D>     Thus, all agreed, amongst the Wooers goes
<U+202D>  Eumaus to the prince, and, whispring close,
<U+202D>  Said:  Now, my love, my charge shall take up me,
<U+202D>  (Your goods and mine).  What here is, you must see
<U+202D>  In fit protection.  But, in chief, regard
<U+202D>  Your own dear safeguard; whose state study hard,
<U+202D>  Lest suffrance seize you.  Many a wicked thought
<U+202D>  Conceal these Wooers; whom just Jove see brought
<U+202D>  To utter ruin, ere it touch at us.
<U+202D>     So chance it, friend,  replied Telemachus,
<U+202D>  Your bever taken, go.  In first of day
<U+202D>  Come, and bring sacrifice the best you may.
<U+202D>  To me and to th Immortals be the care
<U+202D>  or whatsoever here the safeties are.
<U+202D>     This said, he sat in his elaborate throne.
<U+202D>  Eumaus (fed to satisfaction)
<U+202D>  Went to his charge, left both the court and walls
<U+202D>  Full of secure and fatal festivals,
<U+202D>  In which the Wooers pleasures still would sway.
<U+202D>  And now begun the evens near-ending day.
