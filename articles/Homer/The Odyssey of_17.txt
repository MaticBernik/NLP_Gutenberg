BOOK XVIII
ARGUMENT
The beggar Irus arrives at the palace; a combat takes place between him
and Ulysses, in which Irus is by one blow vanquished. Penelope appears to
the suitors, and having reminded them of the presents which she had a
right to expect from them, receives a gift from each. Eurymachus,
provoked by a speech of Ulysses, flings a foot-stool at him, which knocks
down the cup-bearer; a general tumult is the consequence, which
continues, till by the advice of Telemachus, seconded by Amphinomus, the
suitors retire to their respective homes.
    Now came a public mendicant, a man
    Accustom'd, seeking alms, to roam the streets
    Of Ithaca; one never sated yet
    With food or drink; yet muscle had he none,
    Or strength of limb, though giant-built in show.
    Arnaeus was the name which at his birth
    His mother gave him, but the youthful band
    Of suitors, whom as messenger he served,
    All named him Irus. He, arriving, sought
    To drive Ulysses forth from his own home,                         10
    And in rough accents rude him thus rebuked.
      Forth from the porch, old man! lest by the foot
    I drag thee quickly forth. Seest not how all
    Wink on me, and by signs give me command
    To drag thee hence? nor is it aught but shame
    That checks me. Yet arise, lest soon with fists
    Thou force me to adjust our diff'rence.
      To whom Ulysses, low'ring dark, replied.
    Peace, fellow! neither word nor deed of mine
    Wrongs thee, nor feel I envy at the boon,                         20
    However plentiful, which thou receiv'st.
    The sill may hold us both; thou dost not well
    To envy others; thou appear'st like me
    A vagrant; plenty is the gift of heav'n.
    But urge me not to trial of our fists,
    Lest thou provoke me, and I stain with blood
    Thy bosom and thy lips, old as I am.
    So, my attendance should to-morrow prove
    More tranquil here; for thou should'st leave, I judge,
    Ulysses' mansion, never to return.                                30
      Then answer'd Irus, kindling with disdain.
    Gods! with what volubility of speech
    The table-hunter prates, like an old hag
    Collied with chimney-smutch! but ah beware!
    For I intend thee mischief, and to dash
    With both hands ev'ry grinder from thy gums,
    As men untooth a pig pilf'ring the corn.
    Come--gird thee, that all here may view the strife--
    But how wilt thou oppose one young as I?
      Thus on the threshold of the lofty gate                         40
    They, wrangling, chafed each other, whose dispute
    The high-born youth Antinoues mark'd; he laugh'd
    Delighted, and the suitors thus address'd.
      Oh friends! no pastime ever yet occurr'd
    Pleasant as this which, now, the Gods themselves
    Afford us. Irus and the stranger brawl
    As they would box. Haste--let us urge them on.
      He said; at once loud-laughing all arose;
    The ill-clad disputants they round about
    Encompass'd, and Antinoues thus began.                             50
      Attend ye noble suitors to my voice.
    Two paunches lie of goats here on the fire,
    Which fill'd with fat and blood we set apart
    For supper; he who conquers, and in force
    Superior proves, shall freely take the paunch
    Which he prefers, and shall with us thenceforth
    Feast always; neither will we here admit
    Poor man beside to beg at our repasts.
      He spake, whom all approved; next, artful Chief
    Ulysses thus, dissembling, them address'd.                        60
      Princes! unequal is the strife between
    A young man and an old with mis'ry worn;
    But hunger, always counsellor of ill,
    Me moves to fight, that many a bruise received,
    I may be foil'd at last. Now swear ye all
    A solemn oath, that none, for Irus' sake
    Shall, interposing, smite me with his fist
    Clandestine, forcing me to yield the prize.
      He ceas'd, and, as he bade, all present swore
    A solemn oath; then thus, amid them all                           70
    Standing, Telemachus majestic spake.
      Guest! if thy courage and thy manly mind
    Prompt thee to banish this man hence, no force
    Fear thou beside, for who smites thee, shall find
    Yet other foes to cope with; I am here
    In the host's office, and the royal Chiefs
    Eurymachus and Antinoues, alike
    Discrete, accord unanimous with me.
      He ceas'd, whom all approved. Then, with his rags
    Ulysses braced for decency his loins                              80
    Around, but gave to view his brawny thighs
    Proportion'd fair, and stripp'd his shoulders broad,
    His chest and arms robust; while, at his side,
    Dilating more the Hero's limbs and more
    Minerva stood; the assembly with fixt eyes
    Astonish'd gazed on him, and, looking full
    On his next friend, a suitor thus remark'd.
      Irus shall be in Irus found no more.
    He hath pull'd evil on himself. What thewes
    And what a haunch the senior's tatters hid!                       90
      So he--meantime in Irus' heart arose
    Horrible tumult; yet, his loins by force
    Girding, the servants dragg'd him to the fight
    Pale, and his flesh all quiv'ring as he came;
    Whose terrors thus Antinoues sharp rebuked.
      Now, wherefore liv'st, and why wast ever born
    Thou mountain-mass of earth! if such dismay
    Shake thee at thought of combat with a man
    Ancient as he, and worn with many woes?
    But mark, I threaten not in vain; should he                      100
    O'ercome thee, and in force superior prove,
    To Echetus thou go'st; my sable bark
    Shall waft thee to Epirus, where he reigns
    Enemy of mankind; of nose and ears
    He shall despoil thee with his ruthless steel,
    And tearing by the roots the parts away[79]
    That mark thy sex, shall cast them to the dogs.
      He said; _His_ limbs new terrors at that sound
    Shook under him; into the middle space
    They led him, and each raised his hands on high.                 110
    Then doubtful stood Ulysses toil-inured,
    Whether to strike him lifeless to the earth
    At once, or fell him with a managed blow.
    To smite with managed force at length he chose
    As wisest, lest, betray'd by his own strength,
    He should be known. With elevated fists
    Both stood; him Irus on the shoulder struck,
    But he his adversary on the neck
    Pash'd close beneath his ear; he split the bones,
    And blood in sable streams ran from his mouth.                   120
    With many an hideous yell he dropp'd, his teeth
    Chatter'd, and with his heels he drumm'd the ground.
    The wooers, at that sight, lifting their hands
    In glad surprize, laugh'd all their breath away.
    Then, through the vestibule, and right across
    The court, Ulysses dragg'd him by the foot
    Into the portico, where propping him
    Against the wall, and giving him his staff,
    In accents wing'd he bade him thus farewell.
      There seated now, dogs drive and swine away,                   130
    Nor claim (thyself so base) supreme controul
    O'er other guests and mendicants, lest harm
    Reach thee, hereafter, heavier still than this.
      So saying, his tatter'd wallet o'er his back
    He threw suspended by its leathern twist,
    And tow'rd the threshold turning, sat again,
    They laughing ceaseless still, the palace-door
    Re-enter'd, and him, courteous, thus bespake.
      Jove, and all Jove's assessors in the skies
    Vouchsafe thee, stranger, whatsoe'er it be,                      140
    Thy heart's desire! who hast our ears reliev'd
    From that insatiate beggar's irksome tone.
    Soon to Epirus he shall go dispatch'd
    To Echetus the King, pest of mankind.
      So they, to whose propitious words the Chief
    Listen'd delighted. Then Antinoues placed
    The paunch before him, and Amphinomus
    Two loaves, selected from the rest; he fill'd
    A goblet also, drank to him, and said,
      My father, hail! O stranger, be thy lot                        150
    Hereafter blest, though adverse now and hard!
      To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied.
    To me, Amphinomus, endued thou seem'st
    With much discretion, who art also son
    Of such a sire, whose fair report I know,
    Dulichian Nysus, opulent and good.
    Fame speaks thee his, and thou appear'st a man
    Judicious; hear me, therefore; mark me well.
    Earth nourishes, of all that breathe or creep,
    No creature weak as man; for while the Gods                      160
    Grant him prosperity and health, no fear
    Hath he, or thought, that he shall ever mourn;
    But when the Gods with evils unforeseen
    Smite him, he bears them with a grudging mind;
    For such as the complexion of his lot
    By the appointment of the Sire of all,
    Such is the colour of the mind of man.
    I, too, have been familiar in my day
    With wealth and ease, but I was then self-will'd,
    And many wrong'd, embolden'd by the thought                      170
    Of my own father's and my brethren's pow'r.
    Let no man, therefore, be unjust, but each
    Use modestly what gift soe'er of heav'n.
    So do not these. These ever bent I see
    On deeds injurious, the possessions large
    Consuming, and dishonouring the wife
    Of one, who will not, as I judge, remain
    Long absent from his home, but is, perchance,
    Ev'n at the door. Thee, therefore, may the Gods
    Steal hence in time! ah, meet not his return                     180
    To his own country! for they will not part,
    (He and the suitors) without blood, I think,
    If once he enter at these gates again!
      He ended, and, libation pouring, quaff'd
    The generous juice, then in the prince's hand
    Replaced the cup; he, pensive, and his head
    Inclining low, pass'd from him; for his heart
    Forboded ill; yet 'scaped not even he,
    But in the snare of Pallas caught, his life
    To the heroic arm and spear resign'd                             190
    Of brave Telemachus. Reaching, at length,
    The seat whence he had ris'n, he sat again.
      Minerva then, Goddess, caerulean-eyed,
    Prompted Icarius' daughter to appear
    Before the suitors; so to expose the more
    Their drift iniquitous, and that herself
    More bright than ever in her husband's eyes
    Might shine, and in her son's. Much mirth she feign'd,[80]
    And, bursting into laughter, thus began.
      I wish, Eurynome! (who never felt                              200
    That wish till now) though I detest them all,
    To appear before the suitors, in whose ears
    I will admonish, for his good, my son,
    Not to associate with that lawless crew
    Too much, who speak him fair, but foul intend.
      Then answer thus Eurynome return'd.
    My daughter! wisely hast thou said and well.
    Go! bathe thee and anoint thy face, then give
    To thy dear son such counsel as thou wilt
    Without reserve; but shew not there thy cheeks                   210
    Sullied with tears, for profit none accrues
    From grief like thine, that never knows a change.
    And he is now bearded, and hath attained
    That age which thou wast wont with warmest pray'r
    To implore the Gods that he might live to see.
      Her answer'd then Penelope discrete.
    Persuade not me, though studious of my good,
    To bathe, Eurynome! or to anoint
    My face with oil; for all my charms the Gods
    Inhabitants of Olympus then destroy'd,                           220
    When he, embarking, left me. Go, command
    Hippodamia and Autonoee
    That they attend me to the hall, and wait
    Beside me there; for decency forbids
    That I should enter to the men, alone.
      She ceas'd, and through the house the ancient dame
    Hasted to summon whom she had enjoin'd.
      But Pallas, Goddess of the azure eyes,
    Diffused, meantime, the kindly dew of sleep
    Around Icarius' daughter; on her couch                           230
    Reclining, soon as she reclin'd, she dozed,
    And yielded to soft slumber all her frame.
    Then, that the suitors might admire her more,
    The glorious Goddess cloath'd her, as she lay,
    With beauty of the skies; her lovely face
    She with ambrosia purified, with such
    As Cytherea chaplet-crown'd employs
    Herself, when in the eye-ensnaring dance
    She joins the Graces; to a statelier height
    Beneath her touch, and ampler size she grew,                     240
    And fairer than the elephantine bone
    Fresh from the carver's hand. These gifts conferr'd
    Divine, the awful Deity retired.
    And now, loud-prattling as they came, arrived
    Her handmaids; sleep forsook her at the sound,
    She wiped away a tear, and thus she said.
      Me gentle sleep, sad mourner as I am,
    Hath here involved. O would that by a death
    As gentle chaste Diana would herself
    This moment set me free, that I might waste                      250
    My life no longer in heart-felt regret
    Of a lamented husband's various worth
    And virtue, for in Greece no Peer had he!
      She said, and through her chambers' stately door
    Issuing, descended; neither went she sole,
    But with those two fair menials of her train.
    Arriving, most majestic of her sex,
    In presence of the num'rous guests, beneath
    The portal of the stately dome she stood
    Between her maidens, with her lucid veil                         260
    Mantling her lovely cheeks. Then, ev'ry knee
    Trembled, and ev'ry heart with am'rous heat
    Dissolv'd, her charms all coveting alike,
    While to Telemachus her son she spake.
      Telemachus! thou art no longer wise
    As once thou wast, and even when a child.
    For thriven as thou art, and at full size
    Arrived of man, so fair proportion'd, too,
    That ev'n a stranger, looking on thy growth
    And beauty, would pronounce thee nobly born,                     270
    Yet is thy intellect still immature.
    For what is this? why suffer'st thou a guest
    To be abused in thy own palace? how?
    Know'st not that if the stranger seated here
    Endure vexation, the disgrace is thine?
      Her answer'd, then, Telemachus discrete.
    I blame thee not, my mother, that thou feel'st
    Thine anger moved; yet want I not a mind
    Able to mark and to discern between
    Evil and good, child as I lately was,                            280
    Although I find not promptitude of thought
    Sufficient always, overaw'd and check'd
    By such a multitude, all bent alike
    On mischief, of whom none takes part with me.
    But Irus and the stranger have not fought,
    Urged by the suitors, and the stranger prov'd
    Victorious; yes--heav'n knows how much I wish
    That, (in the palace some, some in the court)
    The suitors all sat vanquish'd, with their heads
    Depending low, and with enfeebled limbs,                         290
    Even as that same Irus, while I speak,
    With chin on bosom propp'd at the hall-gate
    Sits drunkard-like, incapable to stand
    Erect, or to regain his proper home.
      So they; and now addressing to the Queen
    His speech, Eurymachus thus interposed.
      O daughter of Icarius! could all eyes
    Throughout Iaesian Argos[81] view thy charms,
    Discrete Penelope! more suitors still
    Assembling in thy courts would banquet here                      300
    From morn to eve; for thou surpassest far
    In beauty, stature, worth, all womankind.
      To whom replied Penelope discrete.
    The Gods, Eurymachus! reduced to nought
    My virtue, beauty, stature, when the Greeks,
    Whom my Ulysses follow'd, sail'd to Troy.
    Could he, returning, my domestic charge
    Himself intend, far better would my fame
    Be so secured, and wider far diffused.
    But I am wretched now, such storms the Gods                      310
    Of woe have sent me. When he left his home,
    Clasping my wrist with his right hand, he said.
      My love! for I imagine not that all
    The warrior Greeks shall safe from Troy return,
    Since fame reports the Trojans brave in fight,
    Skill'd in the spear, mighty to draw the bow,
    And nimble vaulters to the backs of steeds
    High-mettled, which to speediest issue bring
    The dreadful struggle of all-wasting war--
    I know not, therefore, whether heav'n intend                     320
    My safe return, or I must perish there.
    But manage thou at home. Cherish, as now,
    While I am absent, or more dearly still
    My parents, and what time our son thou seest
    Mature, then wed; wed even whom thou wilt,
    And hence to a new home.--Such were his words,
    All which shall full accomplishment ere long
    Receive. The day is near, when hapless I,
    Lost to all comfort by the will of Jove,
    Must meet the nuptials that my soul abhors.                      330
    But this thought now afflicts me, and my mind
    Continual haunts. Such was not heretofore
    The suitors' custom'd practice; all who chose
    To engage in competition for a wife
    Well-qualitied and well-endow'd, produced
    From their own herds and fatted flocks a feast
    For the bride's friends, and splendid presents made,
    But never ate as ye, at others' cost.
      She ceased; then brave Ulysses toil-inured
    Rejoiced that, soothing them, she sought to draw                 340
    From each some gift, although on other views,
    And more important far, himself intent.
      Then thus Antinoues, Eupithes' son.
    Icarius' daughter wise! only accept
    Such gifts as we shall bring, for gifts demand
    That grace, nor can be decently refused;
    But to our rural labours, or elsewhere
    Depart not we, till first thy choice be made
    Of the Achaian, chief in thy esteem.
      Antinoues spake, whose answer all approved.                     350
    Then each dispatch'd his herald who should bring
    His master's gift. Antinoues' herald, first
    A mantle of surpassing beauty brought,
    Wide, various, with no fewer clasps adorn'd
    Than twelve, all golden, and to ev'ry clasp
    Was fitted opposite its eye exact.
    Next, to Eurymachus his herald bore
    A necklace of wrought gold, with amber rich
    Bestudded, ev'ry bead bright as a sun.
    Two servants for Eurydamas produced                              360
    Ear-pendants fashion'd with laborious art,
    Broad, triple-gemm'd, of brilliant light profuse.
    The herald of Polyctor's son, the prince
    Pisander, brought a collar to his Lord,
    A sumptuous ornament. Each Greecian gave,
    And each a gift dissimilar from all.
    Then, loveliest of her sex, turning away,
    She sought her chamber, whom her maidens fair
    Attended, charged with those illustrious gifts.
    Then turn'd, they all to dance and pleasant song                 370
    Joyous, expecting the approach of ev'n.
    Ere long the dusky evening came, and them
    Found sporting still. Then, placing in the hall
    Three hearths that should illumine wide the house,
    They compass'd them around with fuel-wood
    Long-season'd and new-split, mingling the sticks
    With torches. The attendant women watch'd
    And fed those fires by turns, to whom, himself,
    Their unknown Sov'reign thus his speech address'd.
      Ye maidens of the long-regretted Chief                         380
    Ulysses! to the inner-courts retire,
    And to your virtuous Queen, that following there
    Your sev'ral tasks, spinning and combing wool,
    Ye may amuse her; I, meantime, for these
    Will furnish light, and should they chuse to stay
    Till golden morn appear, they shall not tire
    My patience aught, for I can much endure.
      He said; they, titt'ring, on each other gazed.
    But one, Melantho with the blooming cheeks,
    Rebuked him rudely. Dolius was her sire,                         390
    But by Penelope she had been reared
    With care maternal, and in infant years
    Supplied with many a toy; yet even she
    Felt not her mistress' sorrows in her heart,
    But, of Eurymachus enamour'd, oft
    His lewd embraces met; she, with sharp speech
    Reproachful, to Ulysses thus replied.
      Why--what a brainsick vagabond art thou!
    Who neither wilt to the smith's forge retire
    For sleep, nor to the public portico,                            400
    But here remaining, with audacious prate
    Disturb'st this num'rous company, restrain'd
    By no respect or fear; either thou art
    With wine intoxicated, or, perchance,
    Art always fool, and therefore babblest now.
    Say, art thou drunk with joy that thou hast foiled
    The beggar Irus? Tremble, lest a man
    Stronger than Irus suddenly arise,
    Who on thy temples pelting thee with blows
    Far heavier than his, shall drive thee hence                     410
    With many a bruise, and foul with thy own blood.
      To whom Ulysses, frowning stern, replied.
    Snarler! Telemachus shall be inform'd
    This moment of thy eloquent harangue,
    That he may hew thee for it, limb from limb.
      So saying, he scared the women; back they flew
    Into the house, but each with falt'ring knees
    Through dread, for they believ'd his threats sincere.
    He, then illumin'd by the triple blaze,
    Watch'd close the lights, busy from hearth to hearth,            420
    But in his soul, meantime, far other thoughts
    Revolved, tremendous, not conceived in vain.
      Nor Pallas (that they might exasp'rate more
    Laertes' son) permitted to abstain
    From heart-corroding bitterness of speech
    Those suitors proud, of whom Eurymachus,
    Offspring of Polybus, while thus he jeer'd
    Ulysses, set the others in a roar.
      Hear me, ye suitors of the illustrious Queen!
    I shall promulge my thought. This man, methinks,                 430
    Not unconducted by the Gods, hath reach'd
    Ulysses' mansion, for to me the light
    Of yonder torches altogether seems
    His own, an emanation from his head,
    Which not the smallest growth of hair obscures.
      He ended; and the city-waster Chief
    Himself accosted next. Art thou disposed
    To serve me, friend! would I afford thee hire,
    A labourer at my farm? thou shalt not want
    Sufficient wages; thou may'st there collect                      440
    Stones for my fences, and may'st plant my oaks,
    For which I would supply thee all the year
    With food, and cloaths, and sandals for thy feet.
    But thou hast learn'd less creditable arts,
    Nor hast a will to work, preferring much
    By beggary from others to extort
    Wherewith to feed thy never-sated maw.
      Then answer, thus, Ulysses wise return'd.
    Forbear, Eurymachus; for were we match'd
    In work against each other, thou and I,                          450
    Mowing in spring-time, when the days are long,
    I with my well-bent sickle in my hand,
    Thou arm'd with one as keen, for trial sake
    Of our ability to toil unfed
    Till night, grass still sufficing for the proof.--
    Or if, again, it were our task to drive
    Yoked oxen of the noblest breed, sleek-hair'd,
    Big-limb'd, both batten'd to the full with grass,
    Their age and aptitude for work the same
    Not soon to be fatigued, and were the field                      460
    In size four acres, with a glebe through which
    The share might smoothly slide, then should'st thou see
    How strait my furrow should be cut and true.--
    Or should Saturnian Jove this day excite
    Here, battle, or elsewhere, and were I arm'd
    With two bright spears and with a shield, and bore
    A brazen casque well-fitted to my brows,
    Me, then, thou should'st perceive mingling in fight
    Amid the foremost Chiefs, nor with the crime
    Of idle beggary should'st upbraid me more.                       470
    But thou art much a railer, one whose heart
    Pity moves not, and seem'st a mighty man
    And valiant to thyself, only because
    Thou herd'st with few, and those of little worth.
    But should Ulysses come, at his own isle
    Again arrived, wide as these portals are,
    To thee, at once, too narrow they should seem
    To shoot thee forth with speed enough abroad.
      He ceased--then tenfold indignation fired
    Eurymachus; he furrow'd deep his brow                            480
    With frowns, and in wing'd accents thus replied.
      Wretch, I shall roughly handle thee anon,
    Who thus with fluent prate presumptuous dar'st
    Disturb this num'rous company, restrain'd
    By no respect or fear. Either thou art
    With wine intoxicated, or, perchance,
    Art always fool, and therefore babblest now;
    Or thou art frantic haply with delight
    That thou hast foil'd yon vagabond obscure.
      So saying, he seized a stool; but to the knees                 490
    Ulysses flew of the Dulichian Prince
    Amphinomus, and sat, fearing incensed
    Eurymachus; he on his better hand
    Smote full the cup-bearer; on the hall-floor
    Loud rang the fallen beaker, and himself
    Lay on his back clamouring in the dust.
    Strait through the dusky hall tumult ensued
    Among the suitors, of whom thus, a youth,
    With eyes directed to the next, exclaim'd.
      Would that this rambling stranger had elsewhere                500
    Perish'd, or ever he had here arrived,
    Then no such uproar had he caused as this!
    This doth the beggar; he it is for whom
    We wrangle thus, and may despair of peace
    Or pleasure more; now look for strife alone.
      Then in the midst Telemachus upstood
    Majestic, and the suitors thus bespake.
    Sirs! ye are mad, and can no longer eat
    Or drink in peace; some daemon troubles you.
    But since ye all have feasted, to your homes                     510
    Go now, and, at your pleasure, to your beds;
    Soonest were best, but I thrust no man hence.
      He ceased; they gnawing stood their lips, aghast
    With wonder that Telemachus in his speech
    Such boldness used. Then rose Amphinomus,
    Brave son of Nisus offspring of the King
    Aretus, and the assembly thus address'd.
      My friends! let none with contradiction thwart
    And rude reply words rational and just;
    Assault no more the stranger, nor of all                         520
    The servants of renown'd Ulysses here
    Harm any. Come. Let the cup-bearer fill
    To all, that due libation made, to rest
    We may repair at home, leaving the Prince
    To accommodate beneath his father's roof
    The stranger, for he is the Prince's guest.
      He ended, whose advice none disapproved.
    The Hero Mulius then, Dulichian-born,
    And herald of Amphinomus, the cup
    Filling, dispensed it, as he stood, to all;                      530
    They, pouring forth to the Immortals, quaff'd
    The luscious bev'rage, and when each had made
    Libation, and such measure as he would
    Of wine had drunk, then all to rest retired.
