<U+202D>  THE THIRD BOOK OF HOMERS ODYSSEYS
<U+202D>  THE ARGUMENT
<U+202D>  Telemachus, and Heavns wise Dame
<U+202D>  That never husband had, now came
<U+202D>  To Nestor; who his either guest
<U+202D>  Receivd at the religious feast
<U+202D>  He made to Neptune, on his shore;
<U+202D>  And there told what was done before
<U+202D>  The Trojan turrets, and the state
<U+202D>  Of all the Greeks since Ilions fate.
<U+202D>  This book these three of greatest place
<U+202D>  Doth serve with many a varied grace.
<U+202D>  Which past, Minerva takes her leave.
<U+202D>  Whose state when Nestor doth perceive,
<U+202D>  With sacrifice he makes it known,
<U+202D>  Where many a pleasing rite is shown.
<U+202D>  Which done, Telemachus hath gaind
<U+202D>  A chariot of him; who ordaind
<U+202D>  Pisistratus, his son, his guide
<U+202D>  To Sparta; and when starry eyed
<U+202D>  The ample heavn began to be,
<U+202D>  All house-rites to afford them free,
<U+202D>  In Pheris, Diocles did please,
<U+202D>  His surname Ortilochides.
<U+202D>  ANOTHER ARGUMENT
<U+202D>  _<U+0393><U+1F00>µµ<U+03B1>._
<U+202D>     Ulysses son
<U+202D>        With Nestor lies,
<U+202D>     To Sparta gone;
<U+202D>        Thence Pallas flies.
<U+202D>  The sun now left the great and goodly lake,
<U+202D>  And to the firm heavn bright ascent did make,
<U+202D>  To shine as well upon the mortal birth,
<U+202D>  Inhabiting the plowd life-giving earth,
<U+202D>  As on the ever-treaders upon death.
<U+202D>  And now to Pylos, that so garnisheth
<U+202D>  Herself with buildings, old Neleus town,
<U+202D>  The prince and Goddess come had strange sights shown,
<U+202D>  For, on the marine shore, the people there
<U+202D>  To Neptune, that the azure locks doth wear,
<U+202D>  Beeves that were wholly black gave holy flame.
<U+202D>  Nine seats of state they made to his high name;
<U+202D>  And evry seat set with five hundred men,
<U+202D>  And each five hundred was to furnish then
<U+202D>  With nine black oxen evry sacred seat.
<U+202D>  These of the entrails only pleasd to eat,
<U+202D>  And to the God enflamd the fleshy thighs.
<U+202D>     By this time Pallas with the sparkling eyes,
<U+202D>  And he she led, within the haven bore,
<U+202D>  Struck sail, cast anchor, and trod both the shore,
<U+202D>  She first, he after.  Then said Pallas:  Now
<U+202D>  No more befits thee the least bashful brow;
<U+202D>  T embolden which this act is put on thee,
<U+202D>  To seek thy father both at shore and sea,
<U+202D>  And learn in what clime he abides so close,
<U+202D>  Or in the powr of what Fate doth repose.
<U+202D>     Come then, go right to Nestor; let us see,
<U+202D>  If in his bosom any counsel be,
<U+202D>  That may inform us. Pray him not to trace
<U+202D>  The common courtship, and to speak in grace
<U+202D>  Of the demander, but to tell the truth;
<U+202D>  Which will delight him, and commend thy youth
<U+202D>  For such prevention; for he loves no lies,
<U+202D>  Nor will report them, being truly wise.
<U+202D>     He answerd:  Mentor!  how, alas!  shall I
<U+202D>  Present myself?   How greet his gravity?
<U+202D>  My youth by no means that ripe form affords,
<U+202D>  That can digest my minds instinct in words
<U+202D>  Wise, and beseeming th ears of one so sage.
<U+202D>  Youth of most hope blush to use words with age.
<U+202D>     She said:  Thy mind will some conceit impress,
<U+202D>  And something God will prompt thy towardness;
<U+202D>  For, I suppose, thy birth, and breeding too,
<U+202D>  Were not in spite of what the Gods could do.
<U+202D>     This said, she swiftly went before, and he
<U+202D>  Her steps made guides, and followd instantly.
<U+202D>  When soon they reachd the Pylian throngs and seats,
<U+202D>  Where Nestor with his sons sat; and the meats,
<U+202D>  That for the feast servd, round about them were
<U+202D>  Adherents dressing, all their sacred cheer,
<U+202D>  Being roast and boild meats.  When the Pylians saw
<U+202D>  These strangers come, in thrust did all men draw
<U+202D>  About their entry, took their hands, and prayd
<U+202D>  They both would sit; their entry first assayd
<U+202D>  By Nestors son, Pisistratus.  In grace
<U+202D>  Of whose repair, he gave them honourd place
<U+202D>  Betwixt his sire and brother Thrasymed,
<U+202D>  Who sat at feast on soft fells that were spread
<U+202D>  Along the sea sands, kervd, and reachd to them
<U+202D>  Parts of the inwards, and did make a stream
<U+202D>  Of spritely wine into a golden bowl;
<U+202D>  Which to Minerva with a gentle soul
<U+202D>  He gave, and thus spake:  Ere you eat, fair guest,
<U+202D>  Invoke the Seas King, of whose sacred feast
<U+202D>  Your travel hither makes ye partners now;
<U+202D>  When, sacrificing as becomes, bestow
<U+202D>  This bowl of sweet wine on your friend, that he
<U+202D>  May likewise use these rites of piety;
<U+202D>  For I suppose his youth doth prayers use,
<U+202D>  Since all men need the Gods.  But you I choose
<U+202D>  First in this cups disposure, since his years
<U+202D>  Seem short of yours, who more like me appears.
<U+202D>  Thus gave he her the cup of pleasant wine;
<U+202D>  And since a wise and just man did design
<U+202D>  The golden bowl first to her free receit,
<U+202D>  Evn to the Goddess it did add delight,
<U+202D>  Who thus invokd:  Hear thou, whose vast embrace
<U+202D>  Enspheres the whole earth, nor disdain thy grace
<U+202D>  To us that ask it in performing this:
<U+202D>  To Nestor first, and these fair sons of his,
<U+202D>  Vouchsafe all honour; and, next them, bestow
<U+202D>  On all these Pylians, that have offerd now
<U+202D>  This most renowned hecatomb to thee,
<U+202D>  Remuneration fit for them, and free;
<U+202D>  And lastly deign Telemachus and me,
<U+202D>  The work performd for whose effect we came,
<U+202D>  Our safe return, both with our ship and fame.
<U+202D>  Thus prayd she; and herself herself obeyd,
<U+202D>  In th end performing all for which she prayd.
<U+202D>  And now, to pray, and do as she had done,
<U+202D>  She gave the fair round bowl t Ulysses son.
<U+202D>     The meat then dressd, and drawn, and servd t each guest,
<U+202D>  They celebrated a most sumptuous feast.
<U+202D>  When appetite to wine and food allayd,
<U+202D>  Horse-taming Nestor then began, and said:
<U+202D>     Now lifes desire is servd, as far as fare,
<U+202D>  Time fits me to enquire what guests these are.
<U+202D>  Fair guests, what are ye?  And for what coast tries
<U+202D>  Your ship the moist deeps?  For fit merchandise?
<U+202D>  Or rudely coast ye, like our men of prise,
<U+202D>  The rough seas tempting, desperately erring,
<U+202D>  The ill of others in their good conferring?
<U+202D>     The wise prince now his boldness did begin,
<U+202D>  For Pallas self had hardend him within,
<U+202D>  By this device of travel to explore
<U+202D>  His absent father; which two girlonds wore;
<U+202D>  His good by manage of his spirits; and then
<U+202D>  To gain him high grace in th accounts of men.
<U+202D>     O Nestor!  still in whom Nelëus lives!
<U+202D>  And all the glory of the Greeks survives,
<U+202D>  You ask from whence we are, and I relate:
<U+202D>  From Ithaca (whose seat is situate
<U+202D>  Where Neius, the renownéd mountain, rears
<U+202D>  His haughty forehead, and the honour bears
<U+202D>  To be our sea-mark) we assayd the waves.
<U+202D>  The business, I must tell, our own good craves,
<U+202D>  And not the public.  I am come t enquire,
<U+202D>  If, in the fame that best men doth inspire
<U+202D>  Of my most-suffring father, I may hear
<U+202D>  Some truth of his estate now, who did bear
<U+202D>  The name, being joind in fight with you alone,
<U+202D>  To even with earth the height of Ilion.
<U+202D>  Of all men else, that any name did bear,
<U+202D>  And fought for Troy, the sevral ends we hear;
<U+202D>  But his death Jove keeps from the world unknown,
<U+202D>  The certain fame thereof being told by none;
<U+202D>  If on the continent by enemies slain,
<U+202D>  Or with the waves eat of the ravenous main.
<U+202D>  For his love tis that to your knees I sue,
<U+202D>  That you would please, out of your own clear view,
<U+202D>  T assure his sad end; or say, if your ear
<U+202D>  Hath heard of the unhappy wanderer,
<U+202D>  To too much sorrow whom his mother bore.
<U+202D>  You then by all your bounties I implore,
<U+202D>  (If ever to you deed or word hath stood,
<U+202D>  By my good father promisd, renderd good
<U+202D>  Amongst the Trojans, where ye both have tried
<U+202D>  The Grecian suffrance) that in nought applied
<U+202D>  To my respect or pity you will glose,
<U+202D>  But unclothd truth to my desires disclose.
<U+202D>     O my much-lovd,  said he,  since you renew
<U+202D>  Remembrance of the miseries that grew
<U+202D>  Upon our still-in-strength-opposing Greece
<U+202D>  Amongst Troys people, I must touch a piece
<U+202D>  Of all our woes there, either in the men
<U+202D>  Achilles brought by sea and led to gain
<U+202D>  About the country, or in us that fought
<U+202D>  About the city, where to death were brought
<U+202D>  All our chief men, as many as were there.
<U+202D>  There Mars-like Ajax lies; Achilles there;
<U+202D>  There the in-counsel-like-the-Gods, his friend;
<U+202D>  There my dear son Antilochus took end,
<U+202D>  Past measure swift of foot, and staid in fight.
<U+202D>  A number more that ills felt infinite;
<U+202D>  Of which to reckon all, what mortal man,
<U+202D>  If five or six years you should stay here, can
<U+202D>  Serve such enquiry?  You would back again,
<U+202D>  Affected with unsufferable pain,
<U+202D>  Before you heard it.  Nine years siegd we them,
<U+202D>  With all the depth and sleight of stratagem
<U+202D>  That could be thought.  Ill knit to ill past end.
<U+202D>  Yet still they toild us; nor would yet Jove send
<U+202D>  Rest to our labours, nor will scarcely yet.
<U+202D>  But no man livd, that would in public set
<U+202D>  His wisdom by Ulysses policy,
<U+202D>  As thought his equal; so excessively
<U+202D>  He stood superior all ways.  If you be
<U+202D>  His son indeed, mine eyes evn ravish me
<U+202D>  To admiration.  And in all consent
<U+202D>  Your speech puts on his speechs ornament.
<U+202D>  Nor would one say, that one so young could use,
<U+202D>  Unless his son, a rhetoric so profuse.
<U+202D>  And while we livd together, he and I
<U+202D>  Never in speech maintaind diversity;
<U+202D>  Nor sat in council but, by one soul led,
<U+202D>  With spirit and prudent counsel furnishéd
<U+202D>  The Greeks at all hours, that, with fairest course,
<U+202D>  What best became them, they might put in force.
<U+202D>  But when Troys high towrs we had levelld thus,
<U+202D>  We put to sea, and God divided us.
<U+202D>  And then did Jove our sad retreat devise;
<U+202D>  For all the Greeks were neither just nor wise,
<U+202D>  And therefore many felt so sharp a fate,
<U+202D>  Sent from Minervas most pernicious hate;
<U+202D>  Whose mighty Father can do fearful things.
<U+202D>  By whose help she betwixt the brother kings
<U+202D>  Let fall contention; who in council met
<U+202D>  In vain, and timeless, when the sun was set,
<U+202D>  And all the Greeks calld, that came chargd with wine.
<U+202D>  Yet then the kings would utter their design,
<U+202D>  And why they summond.  Menelaus, he
<U+202D>  Put all in mind of home, and cried, To sea.
<U+202D>  But Agamemnon stood on contraries,
<U+202D>  Whose will was, they should stay and sacrifice
<U+202D>  Whole hecatombs to Pallas, to forego
<U+202D>  Her high wrath to them.  Fool!  that did not know
<U+202D>  She would not so be won; for not with ease
<U+202D>  Th Eternal Gods are turnd from what they please.
<U+202D>  So they, divided, on foul language stood.
<U+202D>  The Greeks in huge rout rose, their wine-heat blood
<U+202D>  Two ways affecting.  And, that nights sleep too,
<U+202D>  We turnd to studying either others woe;
<U+202D>  When Jove besides made ready woes enow.
<U+202D>  Morn came, we launchd, and in our ships did stow
<U+202D>  Our goods, and fair-girt women.  Half our men
<U+202D>  The peoples guide, Atrides, did contain,
<U+202D>  And half, being now aboard, put forth to sea.
<U+202D>  A most free gale gave all ships prosprous way.
<U+202D>  God settled then the huge whale-bearing lake,
<U+202D>  And Tenedos we reachd; where, for times sake,
<U+202D>  We did divine rites to the Gods.  But Jove,
<U+202D>  Inexorable still, bore yet no love
<U+202D>  To our return, but did again excite
<U+202D>  A second sad contention, that turnd quite
<U+202D>  A great part of us back to sea again;
<U+202D>  Which were th abundant-in-all-counsels man,
<U+202D>  Your matchless father, who, to gratify
<U+202D>  The great Atrides, back to him did fly.
<U+202D>  But I fled all, with all that followd me,
<U+202D>  Because I knew God studied misery,
<U+202D>  To hurl amongst us.  With me likewise fled
<U+202D>  Martial Tydides.  I the men he led
<U+202D>  Gat to go with him.  Winds our fleet did bring
<U+202D>  To Lesbos, where the yellow-headed king,
<U+202D>  Though late, yet found us, as we put to choice
<U+202D>  A tedious voyage; if we sail should hoise
<U+202D>  Above rough Chius, left on our left hand,
<U+202D>  To th isle of Psyria, or that rugged land
<U+202D>  Sail under, and for windy Mimas steer.
<U+202D>  We askd of God that some ostent might clear
<U+202D>  Our cloudy business, who gave us sign,
<U+202D>  And charge, that all should, in a middle line,
<U+202D>  The sea cut for Euboa, that with speed
<U+202D>  Our long-sustaind infortune might be freed.
<U+202D>  Then did a whistling wind begin to rise,
<U+202D>  And swiftly flew we through the fishy skies,
<U+202D>  Till to Gerastus we in night were brought;
<U+202D>  Where, through the broad sea since we safe had wrought,
<U+202D>  At Neptunes altars many solid thighs
<U+202D>  Of slaughterd bulls we burnd for sacrifice.
<U+202D>     The fourth day came, when Tydeus son did greet
<U+202D>  The haven of Argos with his cómplete fleet.
<U+202D>  But I for Pylos straight steerd on my course;
<U+202D>  Nor ever left the wind his foreright force,
<U+202D>  Since God fore-sent it first.  And thus I came,
<U+202D>  Dear son, to Pylos, uninformd by fame,
<U+202D>  Nor know one savd by Fate, or overcome.
<U+202D>  Whom I have heard of since, set here at home,
<U+202D>  As fits, thou shalt be taught, nought left unshown.
<U+202D>     The expert spear-men, evry Myrmidon,
<U+202D>  Led by the brave heir of the mighty-sould
<U+202D>  Unpeerd Achilles, safe of home got hold;
<U+202D>  Safe Philoctetes, Poans famous seed;
<U+202D>  And safe Idomenaus his men led
<U+202D>  To his home, Crete, who fled the arméd field,
<U+202D>  Of whom yet none the sea from him withheld.
<U+202D>     Atrides, you have both heard, though ye be
<U+202D>  His far-off dwellers, what an end had he,
<U+202D>  Done by Agisthus to a bitter death;
<U+202D>  Who miserably paid for forcéd breath,
<U+202D>  Atrides leaving a good son, that dyed,
<U+202D>  In blood of that deceitful parricide,
<U+202D>  His wreakful sword.  And thou my friend, as he
<U+202D>  For this hath his fame, the like spirit in thee
<U+202D>  Assume at all parts.  Fair and great, I see,
<U+202D>  Thou art in all hope, make it good to th end,
<U+202D>  That after-times as much may thee commend.
<U+202D>     He answerd:  O thou greatest grace of Greece,
<U+202D>  Orestes made that wreak his master-piece,
<U+202D>  And him the Greeks will give a master-praise,
<U+202D>  Verse finding him to last all after-days.
<U+202D>  And would to God the Gods would favour me
<U+202D>  With his performance, that my injury,
<U+202D>  Done by my mothers Wooers, being so foul,
<U+202D>  I might revenge upon their evry soul;
<U+202D>  Who, pressing me with contumelies, dare
<U+202D>  Such things as past the powr of uttrance are.
<U+202D>  But Heavns great Powrs have gracd my destiny
<U+202D>  With no such honour.  Both my sire and I
<U+202D>  Are born to suffer everlastingly.
<U+202D>     Because you name those Wooers, friend,  said he,
<U+202D>  Report says, many such, in spite of thee,
<U+202D>  Wooing thy mother, in thy house commit
<U+202D>  The ills thou namst.  But say:  Proceedeth it
<U+202D>  From will in thee to bear so foul a foil?
<U+202D>  Or from thy subjects hate, that wish thy spoil,
<U+202D>  And will not aid thee, since their spirits rely,
<U+202D>  Against thy rule, on some grave augury?
<U+202D>  What know they, but at length thy father may
<U+202D>  Come, and with violence their violence pay;
<U+202D>  Or he alone, or all the Greeks with him?
<U+202D>  But if Minerva now did so esteem
<U+202D>  Thee, as thy father in times past; whom, past
<U+202D>  All measure, she with glorious favours gract
<U+202D>  Amongst the Trojans, where we sufferd so;
<U+202D>  (O!  I did never see, in such clear show,
<U+202D>  The Gods so grace a man, as she to him,
<U+202D>  To all our eyes, appeard in all her trim)
<U+202D>  If so, I say, she would be pleasd to love,
<U+202D>  And that her minds care thou so much couldst move,
<U+202D>  As did thy father, evry man of these
<U+202D>  Would lose in death their seeking marriages.
<U+202D>     O father,  answerd he,  you make amaze
<U+202D>  Seize me throughout.  Beyond the height of phrase
<U+202D>  You raise expression; but twill never be,
<U+202D>  That I shall move in any Deity
<U+202D>  So blest an honour.  Not by any means,
<U+202D>  If Hope should prompt me, or blind Confidence,
<U+202D>  (The Gods of Fools) or evry Deity
<U+202D>  Should will it; for tis past my destiny.
<U+202D>      The burning-eyed Dame answerd:  What a speech
<U+202D>  Hath past the teeth-guard Nature gave to teach
<U+202D>  Fit question of thy words before they fly!
<U+202D>  God easily can  [1]  (when to mortal eye
<U+202D>  Hes furthest off) a mortal satisfy;
<U+202D>  And does the more still.  For thy card-for sire,
<U+202D>  I rather wish, that I might home retire,
<U+202D>  After my suffrance of a world of woes,
<U+202D>  Far off, and then my glad eyes might disclose
<U+202D>  The day of my return, then straight retire,
<U+202D>  And perish standing by my household fire;
<U+202D>  As Agamemnon did, that lost his life
<U+202D>  By false Agisthus, and his falser wife.
<U+202D>     For Death to come at length, tis due to all;
<U+202D>  Nor can the Gods themselves, when Fate shall call
<U+202D>  Their most-lovd man, extend his vital breath
<U+202D>  Beyond the fixd bounds of abhorréd Death.
<U+202D>     Mentor!  said he,  lets dwell no more on this,
<U+202D>  Although in us the sorrow pious is.
<U+202D>  No such return, as we wish, Fates bequeath
<U+202D>  My erring father; whom a present death
<U+202D>  The Deathless have decreed.  Ill now use speech
<U+202D>  That tends to other purpose; and beseech
<U+202D>  Instruction of grave Nestor, since he flows
<U+202D>  Past shore in all experience, and knows
<U+202D>  The sleights and wisdoms, and whose heights aspire
<U+202D>  Others, as well as my commended sire,
<U+202D>  Whom Fame reports to have commanded three
<U+202D>  Ages of men, and doth in sight to me
<U+202D>  Show like th Immortals.  Nestor!  the renown
<U+202D>  Of old Neleius, make the clear truth known,
<U+202D>  How the most-great-in-empire, Atreus son,
<U+202D>  Sustaind the act of his destruction,
<U+202D>  Where then was Menelaus?  How was it
<U+202D>  That false Agisthus, being so far unfit
<U+202D>  A match for him, could his death so enforce?
<U+202D>  Was he not then in Argos?  or his course
<U+202D>  With men so left, to let a coward breathe
<U+202D>  Spirit enough to dare his brothers death?
<U+202D>     Ill tell thee truth in all, fair son,  said he:
<U+202D>  Right well was this event conceivd by thee.
<U+202D>  If Menelaus in his brothers house
<U+202D>  Had found the idle liver with his spouse,
<U+202D>  Arrivd from Troy, he had not livd, nor dead
<U+202D>  Had the diggd heap pourd on his lustful head,
<U+202D>  But fowls and dogs had torn him in the fields,
<U+202D>  Far off of Argos; not a dame it yields
<U+202D>  Had givn him any tear, so foul his fact
<U+202D>  Showd evn to women.  Us Troys wars had rackd
<U+202D>  To evry sinews sufferance, while he
<U+202D>  In Argos uplands livd, from those works free,
<U+202D>  And Agamemnons wife with force of word
<U+202D>  Flatterd and softend, who, at first, abhorrd
<U+202D>  A fact so infamous.  The heavnly dame
<U+202D>  A good mind had, but was in blood to blame.
<U+202D>  There was a poet, to whose care the king
<U+202D>  His queen committed, and in evry thing,
<U+202D>  When he from Troy went, chargd him to apply
<U+202D>  Himself in all guard to her dignity.
<U+202D>  But when strong Fate so wrapt-in her effects,
<U+202D>  That she resolvd to leave her fit respects,
<U+202D>  Into a desert isle her guardian led,
<U+202D>  There left, the rapine of the vultures fed.
<U+202D>  Then brought he willing home his wills won prize,
<U+202D>  On sacred altars offerd many thighs,
<U+202D>  Hung in the Gods fanes many ornaments,
<U+202D>  Garments and gold, that he the vast events
<U+202D>  Of such a labour to his wish had brought,
<U+202D>  As neither fell into his hope nor thought.
<U+202D>     At last, from Troy saild Spartas king and I,
<U+202D>  Both holding her untouchd.  And, that his eye
<U+202D>  Might see no worse of her, when both were blown
<U+202D>  To sacred Sunium, of Minervas town
<U+202D>  The goodly promontory, with his shafts severe
<U+202D>  Augur Apollo slew him that did steer
<U+202D>  Atrides ship, as he the stern did guide,
<U+202D>  And she the full speed of her sail applied.
<U+202D>  He was a man that natións of men
<U+202D>  Excelld in safe guide of a vessel, when
<U+202D>  A tempest rushd in on the ruffled seas;
<U+202D>  His name was Phrontis Onetorides.
<U+202D>  And thus was Menelaus held from home,
<U+202D>  Whose way he thirsted so to overcome,
<U+202D>  To give his friend the earth, being his pursuit,
<U+202D>  And all his exequies to execute.
<U+202D>  But sailing still the wine-hued seas,  [2]  to reach
<U+202D>  Some shore for fit performance, he did fetch
<U+202D>  The steep mount of the Malians, and there,
<U+202D>  With open voice, offended Jupiter
<U+202D>  Proclaimd the voyage his repugnant mind,
<U+202D>  And pourd the puffs out of a shrieking wind,
<U+202D>  That nourishd billows heightend like to hills;
<U+202D>  And with the fleets division fulfills
<U+202D>  His hate proclaimd; upon a part of Crete
<U+202D>  Casting the navy, where the sea-waves meet
<U+202D>  Rough Jardanus, and where the Cydons live.
<U+202D>     There is a rock, on which the sea doth drive,
<U+202D>  Bare, and all broken, on the confines set
<U+202D>  Of Gortys, that the dark seas likewise fret;
<U+202D>  And hither sent the South a horrid drift
<U+202D>  Of waves against the top, that was the left
<U+202D>  Of that torn cliff as far as Phastus strand.
<U+202D>  A little stone the great seas rage did stand.
<U+202D>  The men here drivn scapd hard the ships sore shocks,
<U+202D>  The ships themselves being wrackd against the rocks,
<U+202D>  Save only five, that blue fore-castles bore,
<U+202D>  Which wind and water cast on Egypts shore.
<U+202D>  When he (there victling well, and store of gold
<U+202D>  Aboard his ships brought) his wild way did hold,
<U+202D>  And t other languagd men was forcd to roam.
<U+202D>  Mean space Agisthus made sad work at home,
<U+202D>  And slew his brother, forcing to his sway
<U+202D>  Atrides subjects, and did sevn years lay
<U+202D>  His yoke upon the rich Mycenian state.
<U+202D>  But in the eighth, to his affrighting fate,
<U+202D>  Divine Orestes home from Athens came,
<U+202D>  And what his royal father felt, the same
<U+202D>  He made the false Agisthus groan beneath.
<U+202D>  _Death evermore is the reward of death._
<U+202D>     Thus having slain him, a sepulchral feast
<U+202D>  He made the Argives for his lustful guest,
<U+202D>  And for his mother whom he did detest.
<U+202D>  The self-same day upon him stole the king
<U+202D>  Good-at-a-martial-shout, and goods did bring,
<U+202D>  As many as his freighted fleet could bear.
<U+202D>  But thou, my son, too long by no means err,
<U+202D>  Thy goods left free for many a spoilful guest,
<U+202D>  Lest they consume some, and divide the rest,
<U+202D>  And thou, perhaps, besides, thy voyage lose.
<U+202D>  To Menelaus yet thy course dispose
<U+202D>  I wish and charge thee; who but late arrivd
<U+202D>  From such a shore and men, as to have livd
<U+202D>  In a return from them he never thought,
<U+202D>  And whom black whirlwinds violently brought
<U+202D>  Within a sea so vast, that in a year
<U+202D>  Not any fowl could pass it anywhere,
<U+202D>  So huge and horrid was it.  But go thou
<U+202D>  With ship and men (or, if thou pleasest now
<U+202D>  To pass by land, there shall be brought for thee
<U+202D>  Both horse and chariot, and thy guides shall be
<U+202D>  My sons themselves) to Sparta the divine,
<U+202D>  And to the king whose locks like amber shine.
<U+202D>  Intreat the truth of him, nor loves he lies,
<U+202D>  Wisdom in truth is, and hes passing wise.
<U+202D>     This said, the Sun went down, and up rose Night,
<U+202D>  When Pallas spake:  O father, all good right
<U+202D>  Bear thy directions.  But divide we now
<U+202D>  The sacrifices tongues, mix wines, and vow
<U+202D>  To Neptune, and the other Ever-Blest,
<U+202D>  That, having sacrificd, we may to rest.
<U+202D>  The fit hour runs now, light dives out of date,
<U+202D>  At sacred feasts we must not sit too late.
<U+202D>     She said; they heard; the heralds water gave;
<U+202D>  The youths crownd cups with wine, and let all have
<U+202D>  Their equal shares, beginning from the cup
<U+202D>  Their parting banquet.  All the tongues cut up,
<U+202D>  The fire they gave them, sacrificd, and rose,
<U+202D>  Wine, and divine rites usd, to each dispose;
<U+202D>  Minerva and Telemachus desird
<U+202D>  They might to ship be, with his leave, retird.
<U+202D>     He, movd with that, provokd thus their abodes:
<U+202D>  Now Jove forbid, and all the long-livd Gods,
<U+202D>  Your leaving me, to sleep aboard a ship;
<U+202D>  As I had drunk of poor Penias whip,
<U+202D>  Even to my nakedness, and had nor sheet
<U+202D>  Nor covring in my house; that warm nor sweet
<U+202D>  A guest, nor I myself, had means to sleep;
<U+202D>  Where I, both weeds and wealthy covrings keep
<U+202D>  For all my guests.  Nor shall Fame ever say,
<U+202D>  The dear son of the man Ulysses lay
<U+202D>  All night a-ship-board here while my days shine,
<U+202D>  Or in my court whiles any son of mine
<U+202D>  Enjoys survival, who shall guests receive,
<U+202D>  Whomever my house hath a nook to leave.
<U+202D>     My much-lovd father,  said Minerva,  well
<U+202D>  All this becomes thee.  But persuade to dwell
<U+202D>  This night with thee thy son Telemachus,
<U+202D>  For more convenient is the course for us,
<U+202D>  That he may follow to thy house and rest,
<U+202D>  And I may board our black-sail, that addrest
<U+202D>  At all parts I may make our men, and cheer
<U+202D>  All with my presence, since of all men there
<U+202D>  I boast myself the senior, th others are
<U+202D>  Youths, that attend in free and friendly care
<U+202D>  Great-sould Telemachus, and are his peers
<U+202D>  In fresh similitude of form and years.
<U+202D>  For their confirmance, I will therefore now
<U+202D>  Sleep in our black bark.  But, when light shall show
<U+202D>  Her silver forehead, I intend my way
<U+202D>  Amongst the Caucons, men that are to pay
<U+202D>  A debt to me, nor small, nor new.  For this,
<U+202D>  Take you him home; whom in the morn dismiss,
<U+202D>  With chariot and your sons, and give him horse
<U+202D>  Ablest in strength, and of the speediest course
<U+202D>     This said, away she flew, formd like the fowl
<U+202D>  Men call the ossifrage; when evry soul
<U+202D>  Amaze invaded; even th old man admird,
<U+202D>  The youths hand took, and said:  O most desird,
<U+202D>  My hope says thy proof will no coward show,
<U+202D>  Nor one unskilld in war, when Deities now
<U+202D>  So young attend thee, and become thy guides;
<U+202D>  Nor any of the heavn-housd States besides,
<U+202D>  But Tritogenias self, the Seed of Jove,
<U+202D>  The great-in-prey, that did in honour move
<U+202D>  So much about thy father, amongst all
<U+202D>  The Grecian army.  Fairest queen, let fall
<U+202D>  On me like favours! Give me good renown!
<U+202D>  Which, as on me, on my lovd wife let down,
<U+202D>  And all my children.  I will burn to thee
<U+202D>  An ox right bred, broad-headed, and yoke-free,
<U+202D>  To no mans hand yet humbled.  Him will I,
<U+202D>  His horns in gold hid, give thy Deity.
<U+202D>     Thus prayd he, and she heard; and home he led
<U+202D>  His sons, and all his heaps of kindered.
<U+202D>  Who entring his court royal, evry one
<U+202D>  He marshalld in his sevral seat and throne;
<U+202D>  And evry one, so kindly come, he gave
<U+202D>  His sweet-wine cup; which none was let to have
<U+202D>  Before his leventh year landed him from Troy;
<U+202D>  Which now the butleress had leave t employ,
<U+202D>  Who therefore piercd it, and did give it vent.
<U+202D>  Of this the old duke did a cup present
<U+202D>  To evry guest; made his Maid many a prayr
<U+202D>  That wears the shield fringd with his nurses hair,
<U+202D>  And gave her sacrifice.  With this rich wine
<U+202D>  And food sufficd, sleep all eyes did decline,
<U+202D>  And all for home went; but his court alone
<U+202D>  Telemachus, divine Ulysses son,
<U+202D>  Must make his lodging, or not please his heart.
<U+202D>     A bed, all chequerd with elaborate art,
<U+202D>  Within a portico that rung like brass,
<U+202D>  He brought his guest to; and his bedfere was
<U+202D>  Pisistratus, the martial guide of men,
<U+202D>  That livd, of all his sons, unwed till then.
<U+202D>  Himself lay in a by-room, far above,
<U+202D>  His bed made by his barren wife, his love.
<U+202D>     The rosy-fingerd Morn no sooner shone,
<U+202D>  But up he rose, took air, and sat upon
<U+202D>  A seat of white and goodly polishd stone,
<U+202D>  That such a gloss as richest ointments wore,
<U+202D>  Before his high gates; where the counsellor
<U+202D>  That matchd the Gods (his father) usd to sit,
<U+202D>  Who now, by fate forcd, stoopd as low as it.
<U+202D>  And here sat Nestor, holding in his hand
<U+202D>  A sceptre; and about him round did stand,
<U+202D>  As early up, his sons troop; Perseus,
<U+202D>  The god-like Thrasymed, and Aretus,
<U+202D>  Echephron, Stratius, and sixth and last
<U+202D>  Pisistratus, and by him (half embracd
<U+202D>  Still as they came) divine Telemachus;
<U+202D>  To these spake Nestor, old Gerenius:
<U+202D>     Haste, lovéd sons, and do me a desire,
<U+202D>  That, first of all the Gods, I may aspire
<U+202D>  To Pallas favour, who vouchsafd to me
<U+202D>  At Neptunes feast her sight so openly.
<U+202D>  Let one to field go, and an ox with speed
<U+202D>  Cause hither brought, which let the herdsman lead;
<U+202D>  Another to my dear guests vessel go,
<U+202D>  And all his soldiers bring, save only two;
<U+202D>  A third the smith that works in gold command
<U+202D>  (Laertius) to attend, and lend his hand,
<U+202D>  To plate the both horns round about with gold;
<U+202D>  The rest remain here close.  But first, see told
<U+202D>  The maids within, that they prepare a feast,
<U+202D>  Set seats through all the court, see straight addrest
<U+202D>  The purest water, and get fuel felld.
<U+202D>     This said, not one but in the service held
<U+202D>  Officious hand.  The ox came led from field;
<U+202D>  The soldiers troopd from ship; the smith he came,
<U+202D>  And those tools brought that servd the actual frame
<U+202D>  His art conceivd, brought anvil, hammers brought,
<U+202D>  Fair tongs, and all, with which the gold was wrought.
<U+202D>  Minerva likewise came, to set the crown
<U+202D>  On that kind sacrifice, and make t her own.
<U+202D>     Then th old knight Nestor gave the smith the gold,
<U+202D>  With which he straight did both the horns infold,
<U+202D>  And trimmd the offring so, the Goddess joyd.
<U+202D>  About which thus were Nestors sons employd:
<U+202D>  Divine Echephron, and fair Stratius,
<U+202D>  Held both the horns.  The water odorous,
<U+202D>  In which they washd, what to the rites was vowd,
<U+202D>  Aretus, in a caldron all bestrowd
<U+202D>  With herbs and flowers, servd in from th holy room
<U+202D>  Where all were drest, and whence the rites must come.
<U+202D>  And after him a hallowd virgin came,
<U+202D>  That brought the barley-cake, and blew the flame.
<U+202D>  The axe, with which the ox should both be felld
<U+202D>  And cut forth, Thrasymed stood by and held.
<U+202D>  Perseus the vessel held that should retain
<U+202D>  The purple liquor of the offring slain.
<U+202D>     Then washd the pious father, then the cake
<U+202D>  (Of barley, salt, and oil, made) took, and brake,
<U+202D>  Askd many a boon of Pallas, and the state
<U+202D>  Of all the offring did initiate,
<U+202D>  In three parts cutting off the hair, and cast
<U+202D>  Amidst the flame.  All th invocation past,
<U+202D>  And all the cake broke, manly Thrasymed
<U+202D>  Stood near, and sure, and such a blow he laid
<U+202D>  Aloft the offring, that to earth he sunk,
<U+202D>  His neck-nerves sunderd, and his spirits shrunk.
<U+202D>  Out shriekd the daughters, daughter-in-laws, and wife
<U+202D>  Of three-agd Nestor, who had eldest life
<U+202D>  Of Clymens daughters, chaste Eurydice.
<U+202D>  The ox on broad earth then laid laterally
<U+202D>  They held, while duke Pisistratus the throat
<U+202D>  Dissolvd, and set the sable blood afloat,
<U+202D>  And then the life the bones left.  Instantly
<U+202D>  They cut him up; apart flew either thigh,
<U+202D>  That with the fat they dubbd, with art alone,
<U+202D>  The throat-brisk, and the sweet-bread pricking on.
<U+202D>  Then Nestor broild them on the coal-turnd wood,
<U+202D>  Pourd black wine on; and by him young men stood,
<U+202D>  That spits fine-pointed held, on which, when burnd
<U+202D>  The solid thighs were, they transfixd, and turnd
<U+202D>  The inwards, cut in cantles; which, the meat
<U+202D>  Vowd to the Gods consumd, they roast and eat.
<U+202D>     In mean space, Polycasté (calld the fair,
<U+202D>  Nestors youngst daughter) bathd Ulysses heir;
<U+202D>  Whom having cleansd, and with rich balms bespread,
<U+202D>  She cast a white shirt quickly oer his head,
<U+202D>  And then his weeds put on; when forth he went,
<U+202D>  And did the person of a God present,
<U+202D>  Came, and by Nestor took his honourd seat,
<U+202D>  This pastor of the people.  Then, the meat
<U+202D>  Of all the spare parts roasted, off they drew,
<U+202D>  Sat, and fell to.  But soon the temprate few
<U+202D>  Rose, and in golden bowls filld others wine.
<U+202D>  Till, when the rest felt thirst of feast decline,
<U+202D>  Nestor his sons bad fetch his high-mand horse,
<U+202D>  And them in chariot join, to run the course
<U+202D>  The prince resolvd.  Obeyd, as soon as heard,
<U+202D>  Was Nestor by his sons, who straight prepard
<U+202D>  Both horse and chariot.  She that kept the store,
<U+202D>  Both bread and wine, and all such viands more,
<U+202D>  As should the feast of Jove-fed kings compose,
<U+202D>  Purveyd the voyage.  To the rich coach rose
<U+202D>  Ulysses son, and close to him ascended
<U+202D>  The duke Pisistratus, the reins intended,
<U+202D>  And scourgd, to force to field, who freely flew;
<U+202D>  And left the town that far her splendour threw,
<U+202D>  Both holding yoke, and shook it all the day.
<U+202D>  But now the sun set, darkning evry way,
<U+202D>  When they to Pheris came; and in the house
<U+202D>  Of Diocles (the son t Orsilochus,
<U+202D>  Whom flood Alphëus got) slept all that night;
<U+202D>  Who gave them each due hospitable rite.
<U+202D>  But when the rosy-fingerd Morn arose,
<U+202D>  They went to coach, and did their horse inclose,
<U+202D>  Drave forth the fore-court, and the porch that yields
<U+202D>  Each breath a sound, and to the fruitful fields
<U+202D>  Rode scourging still their willing flying steeds,
<U+202D>  Who strenuously performd their wonted speeds.
<U+202D>  Their journey ending just when sun went down,
<U+202D>  And shadows all ways through the earth were thrown.
