<U+202D>  THE SIXTEENTH BOOK OF HOMERS ODYSSEYS
<U+202D>  THE ARGUMENT
<U+202D>  The Prince at field, he sends to town
<U+202D>  Eumaus, to make truly known
<U+202D>  His safe return.  By Pallas will,
<U+202D>  Telemachus is givn the skill
<U+202D>  To know his father.  Those that lay
<U+202D>  In ambush, to prevent the way
<U+202D>  Of young Ulyssides for home,
<U+202D>  Retire, with anger overcome.
<U+202D>  ANOTHER ARGUMENT
<U+202D>  _<U+03A0><U+03B9><U+0311>._
<U+202D>     To his most dear
<U+202D>        Ulysses shows.
<U+202D>     The wise-son here
<U+202D>        His father knows.
<U+202D>  Ulysses and divine Eumaus rose
<U+202D>  Soon as the morning could her eyes unclose,
<U+202D>  Made fire, brake fast, and to their pasture send
<U+202D>  The gatherd herds, on whom their swains attend.
<U+202D>  The self-tire barking dogs all fawnd upon,
<U+202D>  Nor barkd, at first sight of Ulysses son.
<U+202D>  The whinings of their fawnings yet did greet
<U+202D>  Ulysses ears, and sounds of certain feet,
<U+202D>  Who thus bespake Eumaus:  Sure some friend,
<U+202D>  Or one well-known, comes, that the mastiffs spend
<U+202D>  Their mouths no louder.  Only some one near
<U+202D>  They whine, and leap about, whose feet I hear.
<U+202D>     Each word of this speech was not spent, before
<U+202D>  His son stood in the entry of the door.
<U+202D>  Out-rushd amazd Eumaus, and let go
<U+202D>  The cup to earth, that he had labourd so,
<U+202D>  Cleansd for the neat wine, did the prince-surprise,
<U+202D>  Kissd his fair forehead, both his lovely eyes,
<U+202D>  Both his white hands, and tender tears distilld.
<U+202D>  There breathd no kind-sould father that was filld
<U+202D>  Less with his sons embraces, that had livd
<U+202D>  Ten years in far-off earth, now new retrievd,
<U+202D>  His only child too, gotten in his age,
<U+202D>  And for whose absence he had felt the rage
<U+202D>  Of griefs upon him, than for this divind
<U+202D>  So-much-for-form was this divine-for-mind;
<U+202D>  Who kissd him through, who grew about him kissing,
<U+202D>  As fresh from death scapd.  Whom so long time missing,
<U+202D>  He wept for joy, and said:  Thou yet art come,
<U+202D>  Sweet light, sweet sun-rise, to thy cloudy home.
<U+202D>  O, never I lookd, when once shippd away
<U+202D>  For Pylos shores, to see thy turning day.
<U+202D>  Come, enter, lovd son, let me feast my heart
<U+202D>  With thy sweet sight, new-come, so far apart.
<U+202D>  Nor, when you livd at home, would you walk down
<U+202D>  Often enough here, but stayd still at town;
<U+202D>  It pleasd you then to cast such forehand view
<U+202D>  About your house on that most damnéd crew.  [1]
<U+202D>     It shall be so then, friend,  said he,  but now
<U+202D>  I come to glad mine eyes with thee, and know
<U+202D>  If still my mother in her house remain,
<U+202D>  Or if some Wooer hath aspird to gain
<U+202D>  Of her in nuptials; for Ulysses bed,
<U+202D>  By this, lies all with spiderss cobwebs spread,
<U+202D>  In penury of him that should supply it.
<U+202D>     She still,  said he,  holds her most constant quiet,
<U+202D>  Aloft thine own house, for the beds respect;
<U+202D>  But, for her lords sad loss, sad nights and days
<U+202D>  Obscure her beauties, and corrupt their rays.
<U+202D>     This said, Eumaus took his brazen spear,
<U+202D>  And in he went; when, being enterd near
<U+202D>  Within the stony threshold; from his seat
<U+202D>  His father rose to him, who would not let
<U+202D>  Th old man remove, but drew him back and prest
<U+202D>  With earnest terms his sitting, saying:  Guest,
<U+202D>  Take here your seat again, we soon shall get
<U+202D>  Within our own house here some other seat.
<U+202D>  Heres one will fetch it.  This said, down again
<U+202D>  His father sat, and to his son his swain
<U+202D>  Strewd fair green osiers, and imposd thereon
<U+202D>  A good soft sheepskin, which made him a throne.
<U+202D>     Then he apposd to them his last-left roast,
<U+202D>  And in a wicker basket bread engrost,
<U+202D>  Filld luscious wine, and then took opposite seat
<U+202D>  To the divine Ulysses.  When, the meat
<U+202D>  Set there before them, all fell-to, and eat.
<U+202D>  When they had fed, the prince said:  Pray thee say,
<U+202D>  Whence comes this guest?  What seaman gave him way
<U+202D>  To this our isle? I hope these feet of his
<U+202D>  Could walk no water.  Who boasts he he is?
<U+202D>     Ill tell all truly son:  From ample Crete
<U+202D>  He boasts himself, and says, his erring feet
<U+202D>  Have many cities trod, and God was he
<U+202D>  Whose finger wrought in his infirmity.
<U+202D>  But, to my cottage, the last scape of his
<U+202D>  Was from a Thesprots ship.  Whateer he is,
<U+202D>  Ill give him you, do what you please; his vaunt
<U+202D>  Is, that he is, at most, a suppliant.
<U+202D>     Eumaus,  said the prince,  to tell me this,
<U+202D>  You have afflicted my weak faculties;
<U+202D>  For how shall I receive him to my house
<U+202D>  With any safety, that suspicious
<U+202D>  Of my young forces (should I be assayd
<U+202D>  With any sudden violence) may want aid
<U+202D>  To shield myself? Besides, if I go home,
<U+202D>  My mother is with two doubts overcome,
<U+202D>  If she shall stay with me, and take fit care
<U+202D>  For all such guests as there seek guestive fare,
<U+202D>  Her husbands bed respecting, and her fame
<U+202D>  Amongst the people; or her blood may frame
<U+202D>  A liking to some Wooer, such as best
<U+202D>  May bed her in his house, not giving least.
<U+202D>  And thus am I unsure of all means free
<U+202D>  To use a guest there, fit for his degree.
<U+202D>  But, being thy guest, Ill be his supply
<U+202D>  For all weeds, such as mere necessity
<U+202D>  Shall more than furnish.  Fit him with a sword,
<U+202D>  And set him where his heart would have been shord;
<U+202D>  Or, if so pleasd, receive him in thy shed,
<U+202D>  Ill send thee clothes, I vow, and all the bread
<U+202D>  His wish would eat, that to thy men and thee
<U+202D>  He be no burthen.  But that I should be
<U+202D>  His mean to my house; where a company
<U+202D>  Of wrong-professing Wooers wildly live,
<U+202D>  I will in no sort author, lest they give
<U+202D>  Foul use to him, and me as gravely grieve.
<U+202D>  For what great act can anyone achieve
<U+202D>  Against a multitude, although his mind
<U+202D>  Retain a courage of the greatest kind?
<U+202D>  For all minds have not force in one degree.
<U+202D>     Ulysses answerd:  O friend, since tis free
<U+202D>  For any man to change fit words with thee,
<U+202D>  Ill freely speak:  Methinks, a wolfish powr
<U+202D>  My heart puts on to tear and to devour,
<U+202D>  To hear your affirmation, that, in spite
<U+202D>  Of what may fall on you, made opposite,
<U+202D>  Being one of your proportion, birth, and age,
<U+202D>  These Wooers should in such injustice rage.
<U+202D>  What should the cause be?  Do you wilfully
<U+202D>  Endure their spoil?  Or hath your empery
<U+202D>  Been such amongst your people, that all gather
<U+202D>  In troop, and one voice (which evn God doth father)
<U+202D>  And vow your hate so, that they suffer them?
<U+202D>  Or blame your kinsfolks faiths, before th extreme
<U+202D>  Of your first stroke hath tried them, whom a man,
<U+202D>  When strifes to blows rise, trusts, though battle ran
<U+202D>  In huge and high waves?  Would to heavn my spirit
<U+202D>  Such youth breathd, as the man that must inherit
<U+202D>  Yet-never-touchd Ulysses, or that he,
<U+202D>  But wandring this way, would but come, and see
<U+202D>  What my age could achieve (and there is Fate
<U+202D>  For Hope yet left, that he may recreate
<U+202D>  His eyes with such an object) this my head
<U+202D>  Should any stranger strike off, if stark dead
<U+202D>  I struck not all, the house in open force
<U+202D>  Entring with challenge!  If their great concourse
<U+202D>  Did over-lay me, being a man alone,
<U+202D>  (Which you urge for yourself) be you that one,
<U+202D>  I rather in mine own house wish to die
<U+202D>  One death for all, than so indecently
<U+202D>  See evermore deeds worse than death applied,
<U+202D>  Guests wrongd with vile words and blow-giving pride,
<U+202D>  The women-servants draggd in filthy kind
<U+202D>  About the fair house, and in corners blind
<U+202D>  Made serve the rapes of ruffians, food devourd
<U+202D>  Idly and rudely, wine exhaust, and pourd
<U+202D>  Through throats profane; and all about a deed
<U+202D>  Thats ever wooing, and will never speed.
<U+202D>     Ill tell you, guest, most truly,  said his son,
<U+202D>  I do not think that all my people run
<U+202D>  One hateful course against me; nor accuse
<U+202D>  Kinsfolks that I in strifes of weight might use;
<U+202D>  But Jove will have it so, our race alone
<U+202D>  (As if made singular) to one and one
<U+202D>  His hand confining.  Only to the king,
<U+202D>  Jove-bred Arcesius, did Laertes spring;
<U+202D>  Only to old Laertes did descend
<U+202D>  Ulysses; only to Ulysses end
<U+202D>  Am I the adjunct, whom he left so young,
<U+202D>  That from me to him never comfort sprung.
<U+202D>  And to all these now, for their race, arise
<U+202D>  Up in their house a brood of enemies.
<U+202D>  As many as in these isles bow mens knees,
<U+202D>  Samos, Dulichius, and the rich-in-trees
<U+202D>  Zacynthus, or in this rough isles command,
<U+202D>  So many suitors for the nuptials stand,
<U+202D>  That ask my mother, and, mean space, prefer
<U+202D>  Their lusts to all spoil, that dishonour her.
<U+202D>  Nor doth she, though she loaths, deny their suits,
<U+202D>  Nor they denials take, though taste their fruits.
<U+202D>  But all this time the state of all things there
<U+202D>  Their throats devour, and I must shortly bear
<U+202D>  A part in all.  And yet the periods
<U+202D>  Of these designs lie in the knees of Gods.
<U+202D>  Of all loves then, Eumaus, make quick way
<U+202D>  To wise Penelopé, and to her say
<U+202D>  My safe return from Pylos, and alone,
<U+202D>  Return thou hither, having made it known.
<U+202D>  Nor let, besides my mother, any ear
<U+202D>  Partake thy message, since a number bear
<U+202D>  My safe return displeasure.  He replied;
<U+202D>     I know, and comprehend you.  You divide
<U+202D>  Your mind with one that understands you well.
<U+202D>  But, all in one yet, may I not reveal
<U+202D>  To th old hard-fated Arcesiades
<U+202D>  Your safe return?  Who, through his whole distress
<U+202D>  Felt for Ulysses, did not yet so grieve,
<U+202D>  But with his household he had will to live,
<U+202D>  And servd his appetite with wine and food,
<U+202D>  Surveyd his husbandry, and did his blood
<U+202D>  Some comforts fitting life; but since you took
<U+202D>  Your ship for Pylos, he would never brook
<U+202D>  Or wine or food, they say, nor cast an eye
<U+202D>  On any labour, but sits weeping by,
<U+202D>  And sighing out his sorrows, ceaseless moans
<U+202D>  Wasting his body, turnd all skin and bones.
<U+202D>     More sad news still,  said he,  yet, mourn he still;
<U+202D>  For if the rule of all mens works be will,
<U+202D>  And his will his way goes, mine stands inclind
<U+202D>  T attend the home-turn of my nearer kind.  [2]
<U+202D>  Do then what I enjoin; which givn effect,
<U+202D>  Err nor to field to him, but turn direct,
<U+202D>  Entreating first my mother, with most speed,
<U+202D>  And all the secrecy that now serves need,
<U+202D>  To send this way their store-house guardian,
<U+202D>  And she shall tell all to the aged man.  [3]
<U+202D>     He took his shoes up, put them on, and went.
<U+202D>  Nor was his absence hid from Joves descent,
<U+202D>  Divine Minerva, who took straight to view,
<U+202D>  A goodly womans shape that all works knew,
<U+202D>  And, standing in the entry, did prefer
<U+202D>  Her sight t Ulysses; but, though meeting her,
<U+202D>  His son Telemachus nor saw nor knew.
<U+202D>  _The Gods clear presences are know to few._
<U+202D>  Yet, with Ulysses, evn the dogs did see,
<U+202D>  And would not bark, but, whining lovingly,
<U+202D>  Fled to the stalls far side.  When she her eyne
<U+202D>  Movd to Ulysses; he knew her design,
<U+202D>  And left the house, passd the great sheep-cotes wall,
<U+202D>  And stood before her.  She bade utter all
<U+202D>  Now to his son, nor keep the least unlosd,
<U+202D>  That, all the Wooers deaths being now disposd,
<U+202D>  They might approach the town; affirming; she
<U+202D>  Not long would fail t assist to victory.
<U+202D>     This said, she laid her golden rod on him,
<U+202D>  And with his late-worn weeds gracd evry limb,
<U+202D>  His body straightend, and his youth instilld,
<U+202D>  His fresh blood calld up, evry wrinkle filld
<U+202D>  About his broken eyes, and on his chin
<U+202D>  The brown hair spread.  When his whole trim wrought in,
<U+202D>  She issued, and he enterd to his son,
<U+202D>  Who stood amazd, and thought some God had done
<U+202D>  His house that honour, turnd away his eyes,
<U+202D>  And said;  Now guest, you grace another guise
<U+202D>  Than suits your late show.  Other weeds you wear,
<U+202D>  And other person.  Of the starry sphere
<U+202D>  You certainly present some deathless God.
<U+202D>  Be pleasd, that to your here-vouchsafd abode
<U+202D>  We may give sacred rites, and offer gold,
<U+202D>  To do us favour.  He replied;  I hold
<U+202D>  No deified state.  Why put you thus on me
<U+202D>  A Gods resemblance?  I am only he
<U+202D>  That bears thy fathers name; for whose lovd sake
<U+202D>  Thy youth so grieves, whose absence makes thee take
<U+202D>  Such wrongs of men.  Thus kissd he him, nor could
<U+202D>  Forbear those tears that in such mighty hold
<U+202D>  He held before, still held, still issuing ever;
<U+202D>  And now, the shores once broke, the springtide never
<U+202D>  Forbore earth from the cheeks he kissd.  His son,
<U+202D>  By all these violent arguments not won
<U+202D>  To credit him his father, did deny
<U+202D>  His kind assumpt, and said, some Deity
<U+202D>  Feignd that joys cause, to make him grieve the more;
<U+202D>  Affirming, that no man, whoever wore
<U+202D>  The garment of mortality, could take,
<U+202D>  By any utmost powr his soul could make,
<U+202D>  Such change into it, since, at so much will,
<U+202D>  Not Jove himself could both remove and fill
<U+202D>  Old age with youth, and youth with age so spoil,
<U+202D>  In such an instant.   You wore all the soil
<U+202D>  Of age but now, and were old; and but now
<U+202D>  You bear that young grace that the Gods indow
<U+202D>  Their heavn-born forms withal.  His father said:
<U+202D>  Telemachus!  Admire, nor stand dismayd,
<U+202D>  But know thy solid father; since within
<U+202D>  He answers all parts that adorn his skin.
<U+202D>  There shall no more Ulyssesses come here.
<U+202D>  I am the man, that now this twentieth year
<U+202D>  (Still under suffrance of a world of ill)
<U+202D>  My country-earth recover.  Tis the will
<U+202D>  The prey-professor Pallas puts in act,
<U+202D>  Who put me thus together, thus distract
<U+202D>  In aged pieces as evn now you saw,
<U+202D>  This youth now rendring.  Tis within the law
<U+202D>  Of her free powr.  Sometimes to show me poor,
<U+202D>  Sometimes again thus amply to restore
<U+202D>  My youth and ornaments, she still would please.
<U+202D>  _The Gods can raise, and throw men down, with ease._
<U+202D>     This said, he sat; when his Telemachus pourd
<U+202D>  Himself about him; tears on tears he showrd,
<U+202D>  And to desire of moan increasd the cloud.
<U+202D>  Both wept and howld, and laid out shrieks more loud
<U+202D>  Than or the bird-bone-breaking eagle rears,
<U+202D>  Or brood-kind vulture with the crooked seres,
<U+202D>  When rustic hands their tender eyries draw,
<U+202D>  Before they give their wings their full-plumd law.
<U+202D>  But miserably pourd they from beneath
<U+202D>  Their lids their tears, while both their breasts did breathe
<U+202D>  As frequent cries; and, to their fervent moan,
<U+202D>  The light had left the skies, if first the son
<U+202D>  Their dumb moans had not vented, with demand
<U+202D>  What ship it was that gave the natural land
<U+202D>  To his blessd feet?  He then did likewise lay
<U+202D>  Hand on his passion, and gave these words way:
<U+202D>     Ill tell thee truth, my son:  The men that bear
<U+202D>  Much fame for shipping, my reducers were
<U+202D>  To long-wishd Ithaca, who each man else
<U+202D>  That greets their shore give pass to where he dwells.
<U+202D>  The Phaacensian peers, in one nights date,
<U+202D>  While I fast slept, fetchd th Ithacensian state,
<U+202D>  Gracd me with wealthy gifts, brass, store of gold,
<U+202D>  And robes fair-wrought; all which have secret hold
<U+202D>  In caves that by the Gods advice I chusd.
<U+202D>  And now Minervas admonitions usd
<U+202D>  For this retreat, that we might here dispose
<U+202D>  In close discourse the slaughters of our foes.
<U+202D>  Recount the number of the Wooers then,
<U+202D>  And let me know what name they hold with men,
<U+202D>  That my mind may cast over their estates
<U+202D>  A curious measure, and confer the rates
<U+202D>  Of our two powrs and theirs, to try, if we
<U+202D>  Alone may propagate to victory
<U+202D>  Our bold encounters of them all, or prove
<U+202D>  The kind assistance of some others love.
<U+202D>     O father,  he replied,  I oft have heard
<U+202D>  Your counsels and your force of hand preferrd
<U+202D>  To mighty glory, but your speeches now
<U+202D>  Your ventrous mind exceeding mighty show.
<U+202D>  Evn to amaze they move me; for, in right
<U+202D>  Of no fit counsel, should be brought to fight
<U+202D>  Two men gainst th able faction of a throng.
<U+202D>  No one two, no one ten, no twice ten, strong
<U+202D>  These Wooers are, but more by much.  For know,
<U+202D>  That from Dulichius there are fifty-two,
<U+202D>  All choice young men; and evry one of these
<U+202D>  Six men attend.  From Samos crossd the seas
<U+202D>  Twice-twelve young gallants.  From Zacynthus came
<U+202D>  Twice-ten.  Of Ithaca, the best of name,
<U+202D>  Twice-six.  Of all which all the state they take
<U+202D>  A sacred poet and a herald make.
<U+202D>  Their delicacies two, of special sort
<U+202D>  In skill of banquets, serve.  And all this port
<U+202D>  If we shall dare t encounter, all-thrust-up
<U+202D>  In one strong roof, have great care lest the cup,
<U+202D>  Your great mind thirsts, exceeding bitter taste,
<U+202D>  And your retreat commend not to your haste
<U+202D>  Your great attempt, but make you say, you buy
<U+202D>  Their prides revenges at a price too high.
<U+202D>  And therefore, if you could; twere well you thought
<U+202D>  Of some assistant.  Be your spirit wrought
<U+202D>  In such a mans election, as may lend
<U+202D>  His succours freely, and express a friend.
<U+202D>     His father answerd:  Let me ask of thee;
<U+202D>  Hear me, consider, and then answer me.
<U+202D>  Thinkst thou, if Pallas and the King of skies
<U+202D>  We had to friend, would their sufficiencies
<U+202D>  Make strong our part?  Or that some other yet
<U+202D>  My thoughts must work for?  These,  said he  are set
<U+202D>  Aloft the clouds, and are found aids indeed,
<U+202D>  As powrs not only that these men exceed,
<U+202D>  But bear of all men else the high command,
<U+202D>  And hold of Gods an overruling hand.
<U+202D>     Well then,  said he,  not these shall sever long
<U+202D>  Their force and ours in fights assurd and strong.
<U+202D>  And then twixt us and them shall Mars prefer
<U+202D>  His strength, to stand our great distinguisher,
<U+202D>  When in mine own roofs I am forcd to blows.
<U+202D>  But when the day shall first her fires disclose,
<U+202D>  Go thou for home, and troop up with the Wooers,
<U+202D>  Thy will with theirs joind, powr with their rude powrs;
<U+202D>  And after shall the herdsman guide to town
<U+202D>  My steps, my person wholly overgrown
<U+202D>  With all appearance of a poor old swain,
<U+202D>  Heavy, and wretched.  If their high disdain
<U+202D>  Of my vile presence make them my desert
<U+202D>  Affect with contumelies, let thy lovd heart
<U+202D>  Beat in fixd cónfines of thy bosom still,
<U+202D>  And see me suffer, patient of their ill.
<U+202D>  Ay, though they drag me by the heels about
<U+202D>  Mine own free earth, and after hurl me out,
<U+202D>  Do thou still suffer.  Nay, though with their darts
<U+202D>  They beat and bruise me, bear.  But these foul parts
<U+202D>  Persuade them to forbear, and by their names
<U+202D>  Call all with kind words; bidding, for their shames,
<U+202D>  Their pleasures cease.  If yet they yield not way,
<U+202D>  There breaks the first light of their fatal day.
<U+202D>  In mean space, mark this:  When the chiefly-wise
<U+202D>  Minerva prompts me, Ill inform thine eyes
<U+202D>  With some givn sign, and then all th arms that are
<U+202D>  Aloft thy roof in some near room prepare
<U+202D>  For speediest use.  If those brave men inquire
<U+202D>  Thy end in all, still rake up all thy fire
<U+202D>  In fair cool words, and say:  I bring them down
<U+202D>  To scour the smoke off, being so overgrown
<U+202D>  That one would think all fumes, that ever were
<U+202D>  Breathd since Ulysses loss, reflected here.
<U+202D>  These are not like the arms he left behind,
<U+202D>  In way for Troy.  Besides, Jove prompts my mind
<U+202D>  In their remove apart thus with this thought,
<U+202D>  That, if in height of wine there should be wrought,
<U+202D>  Some harsh contention twixt you, this apt mean
<U+202D>  To mutual bloodshed may be taken clean
<U+202D>  From out your reach, and all the spoil prevented
<U+202D>  Of present feast, perhaps evn then presented
<U+202D>  My mothers nuptials to your long kind vows.
<U+202D>  _Steel itself, ready, draws a man to blows._
<U+202D>  Thus make their thoughts secure; to us alone
<U+202D>  Two swords, two darts, two shields left:  which see done
<U+202D>  Within our readiest reach, that at our will
<U+202D>  We may resume, and charge, and all their skill
<U+202D>  Pallas and Jove, that all just counsels breathe,
<U+202D>  May darken with secureness to their death.
<U+202D>  And let me charge thee now, as thou art mine,
<U+202D>  And as thy veins mine own true blood combine:
<U+202D>  Let, after this, none know Ulysses near,
<U+202D>  Not anyone of all the household there,
<U+202D>  Not here the herdsman, not Laertes be
<U+202D>  Made privy, not herself Penelopé
<U+202D>  But only let thyself and me work out
<U+202D>  The womens thoughts of all things borne about
<U+202D>  The Wooers hearts; and then thy men approve,
<U+202D>  To know who honours, who with revrence love,
<U+202D>  Our well-weighd memories, and who is won
<U+202D>  To fail thy fit right, though my only son.
<U+202D>     You teach, said he,  so punctually now,
<U+202D>  As I knew nothing, nor were sprung from you.
<U+202D>  I hope, hereafter, you shall better know
<U+202D>  What soul I bear, and that it doth not let
<U+202D>  The least loose motion pass his natural seat.
<U+202D>  But this course you propose will prove, I fear,
<U+202D>  Small profit to us; and could wish your care
<U+202D>  Would weigh it better as too far about.
<U+202D>  For time will ask much, to the sifting out
<U+202D>  Of each mans disposition by his deeds;
<U+202D>  And, in the mean time, evry Wooer feeds
<U+202D>  Beyond satiety, nor knows how to spare.
<U+202D>  The women yet, since they more easy are
<U+202D>  For our inquiry, I would wish you try,
<U+202D>  Who right your state, who do it injury.
<U+202D>  The men I would omit, and these things make
<U+202D>  Your labour after.  But, to undertake
<U+202D>  The Wooers war, I wish your utmost speed,
<U+202D>  Especially if you could cheer the deed
<U+202D>  With some ostent from Jove.  Thus, as the sire
<U+202D>  Consented to the son, did here expire
<U+202D>  Their mutual speech.  And now the ship was come,
<U+202D>  That brought the young prince and his soldiers home,
<U+202D>  The deep haven reachd, they drew the ship ashore,
<U+202D>  Took all their arms out, and the rich gifts bore
<U+202D>  To Clitius house.  But to Ulysses court
<U+202D>  They sent a herald first, to make report
<U+202D>  To wise Penelopé, that safe at field
<U+202D>  Her son was left; yet, since the ship would yield
<U+202D>  Most haste to her, he sent that first, and them
<U+202D>  To comfort with his utmost the extreme
<U+202D>  He knew she sufferd.  At the court now met
<U+202D>  The herald and the herdsman, to repeat
<U+202D>  One message to the queen.  Both whom arrivd
<U+202D>  Within the gates; both to be foremost strivd
<U+202D>  In that good news.  The herald, he for haste
<U+202D>  Amongst the maids bestowd it, thinking placd
<U+202D>  The queen amongst them.  Now,  said he,  O queen,
<U+202D>  Your lovd son is arrivd.   And, then was seen
<U+202D>  The queen herself, to whom the herdsman told
<U+202D>  All that Telemachus enjoind he should;
<U+202D>  All which dischargd, his steps he back bestows,
<U+202D>  And left both court and city for his sows.
<U+202D>  The Wooers then grew sad; soul-vexd, and all
<U+202D>  Made forth the court; when, by the mighty wall
<U+202D>  They took their sevral seats, before the gates.
<U+202D>  To whom Eurymachus initiates.
<U+202D>  Their utterd grievance.  O,  said he,  my friends,
<U+202D>  A work right-great begun, as proudly ends,
<U+202D>  We said, Telemachus should never make
<U+202D>  His voyage good, nor this shore ever take
<U+202D>  For his returns receipt; and yet we fail,
<U+202D>  And he performs it.  Come, lets man a sail,
<U+202D>  The best In our election, and bestow
<U+202D>  Such soldiers in her as can swiftest row,
<U+202D>  To tell our friends that way-lay his retreat
<U+202D>  Tis safe performd, and make them quickly get
<U+202D>  Their ship for Ithaca.  This was not said
<U+202D>  Before Amphinomus in port displayd
<U+202D>  The ship arrivd, her sails then under-stroke,
<U+202D>  And oars resumd; when, laughing, thus he spoke:
<U+202D>     Move for no messenger.  These men are come,
<U+202D>  Some God hath either told his turning home,
<U+202D>  Or they themselves have seen his ship gone by,
<U+202D>  Had her in chase, and lost her.  Instantly
<U+202D>  They rose, and went to port; found drawn to land
<U+202D>  The ship, the soldiers taking arms in hand.
<U+202D>  The Wooers themselves to council went in throng,
<U+202D>  And not a man besides, or old, or young,
<U+202D>  Let sit amongst them.  Then Eupitheus son,
<U+202D>  Antinous, said:  See, what the Gods have done!
<U+202D>  They only have deliverd from our ill
<U+202D>  The men we way-laid.  Evry windy hill
<U+202D>  Hath been their watch-towr, where by turns they stood
<U+202D>  Continual sentinel.  And we made good
<U+202D>  Our work as well, for, sun once set, we never
<U+202D>  Slept wink ashore all night, but made sail ever,
<U+202D>  This way and that, evn till the morning kept
<U+202D>  Her sacred station, so to intercept
<U+202D>  And take his life, for whom our ambush lay;
<U+202D>  And yet hath God to his return givn way.
<U+202D>  But let us prosecute with counsels here
<U+202D>  His necessary death, nor anywhere
<U+202D>  Let rest his safety; for if he survive,
<U+202D>  Our sails will never-in wishd havens arrive;
<U+202D>  Since he is wise, hath soul, and counsel too,
<U+202D>  To work the people, who, will never do
<U+202D>  Our faction favour.  What we then intend
<U+202D>  Against his person, give we present end,
<U+202D>  Before he call a council, which, believe,
<U+202D>  His spirit will haste, and point where it doth grieve,
<U+202D>  Stand up amongst them all, and urge his death
<U+202D>  Decreed amongst us.  Which complaint will breathe
<U+202D>  A fire about their spleens, and blow no praise
<U+202D>  On our ill labours.  Lest, they therefore raise
<U+202D>  Powr to exile us from our native earth,
<U+202D>  And force our lives societies to the birth
<U+202D>  Of foreign countries, let our speeds prevent,
<U+202D>  His coming home to this austere complaint,
<U+202D>  At field and far from town, or in some way
<U+202D>  Of narrow passage, with his latest day
<U+202D>  Shown to his forward youth, his goods and lands
<U+202D>  Left to the free division of our hands,
<U+202D>  The moveables made all his mothers dowr,
<U+202D>  And his, whoever Fate affords the powr
<U+202D>  To celebrate, with her sweet Hymens rites.
<U+202D>  Or if this please not, but your appetites
<U+202D>  Stand to his safety, and to give him seat
<U+202D>  In his whole birth-right, let us look to eat
<U+202D>  At his cost never more, but evry man
<U+202D>  Haste to his home, and wed, with whom he can
<U+202D>  At home, and there lay first about for dowr
<U+202D>  And then the woman give his second powr
<U+202D>  Of nuptial-liking, and, for last, apply
<U+202D>  His purpose with most gifts and destiny.
<U+202D>     This silence causd; whose breach, at last, begun
<U+202D>  Amphinomus, the much renownéd son
<U+202D>  Of Nisus surnamd Aretiades,
<U+202D>  Who from Dulichius full of flowry leas
<U+202D>  Led all the Wooers, and in chief did please
<U+202D>  The queen with his discourse, because it grew
<U+202D>  From roots of those good minds that did endue  [4]
<U+202D>  His goodly person; who, exceeding wise,
<U+202D>  Usd this speech:  Friends, I never will advise
<U+202D>  The princes death; for tis a damnéd thing
<U+202D>  To put to death the issue of a king.
<U+202D>  First, therefore, lets examine, what applause
<U+202D>  The Gods will give it:  If the equal laws
<U+202D>  Of Jove approve it, I myself will be
<U+202D>  The man shall kill him, and this company
<U+202D>  Exhort to that mind:  If the Gods remain
<U+202D>  Adverse, and hate it, I advise, refrain.
<U+202D>     This said Amphinomus, and pleasd them all
<U+202D>  When all arose, and in Ulysses hall
<U+202D>  Took seat again.  Then to the queen was come
<U+202D>  The Wooers plot, to kill her son at home,
<U+202D>  Since their abroad-design had missd success,
<U+202D>  The herald Medon (who the whole address
<U+202D>  Knew of their counsels) making the report.
<U+202D>  The Goddess of her sex, with her fair sort
<U+202D>  Of lovely women, at the large halls door
<U+202D>  (Her bright cheeks clouded with a veil she wore)
<U+202D>  Stood, and directed to Antinous
<U+202D>  Her sharp reproof, which she digested thus:
<U+202D>     Antinous!  Composd of injury!
<U+202D>  Plotter of mischief!  Though reports that fly
<U+202D>  Amongst our Ithacensian people say
<U+202D>  That thou, of all that glory in their sway,
<U+202D>  Art best in words and counsels, th art not so.
<U+202D>  Fond, busy fellow, why plottst thou the woe
<U+202D>  And slaughter of my son, and dost not fear
<U+202D>  The presidents of suppliants, when the ear
<U+202D>  Of Jove stoops to them?  Tis unjust to do
<U+202D>  Slaughter for slaughter, or pay woe for woe,
<U+202D>  Mischief for kindness.  Death for life sought, then,
<U+202D>  Is an injustice to be loathd of men.
<U+202D>  Serves not thy knowledge to remember when
<U+202D>  Thy father fled to us?  Who (movd to wrath
<U+202D>  Against the Taphian thieves) pursued with scathe
<U+202D>  The guiltless Thesprots; in whose peoples fear,
<U+202D>  Pursuing him for wreak, he landed here,
<U+202D>  They after him, professing both their prize
<U+202D>  Of all his chiefly-valued faculties,
<U+202D>  And more prizd life.  Of all whose bloodiest ends
<U+202D>  Ulysses curbd them, though they were his friends.
<U+202D>  Yet thou, like one that no law will allow
<U+202D>  The least true honour, eatst his house up now
<U+202D>  That fed thy father; woost for love his wife,
<U+202D>  Whom thus thou grievst and seekst her sole sons life!
<U+202D>  Cease, I command thee, and command the rest
<U+202D>  To see all thought of these foul fashions ceasd.
<U+202D>     Eurymachus replied:  Be confident,
<U+202D>  Thou all-of-wit-made, the most famd descent
<U+202D>  Of king Icarius.  Free thy spirits of fear.
<U+202D>  There lives not anyone, nor shall live here
<U+202D>  Now, nor hereafter, while my life gives heat
<U+202D>  And light to me on earth, that dares intreat
<U+202D>  With any ill touch thy well-lovéd son,
<U+202D>  But here I vow, and here will see it done,
<U+202D>  His life shall stain my lance.  If on his knees
<U+202D>  The city-racer, Laertiades,
<U+202D>  Hath made me sit, put in my hand his food,
<U+202D>  And held his red wine to me, shall the blood
<U+202D>  Of his Telemachus on my hand lay
<U+202D>  The least pollution, that my life can stay?
<U+202D>  No!  I have ever chargd him not to fear
<U+202D>  Deaths threat from any.  And, for that most dear
<U+202D>  Love of his father, he shall ever be
<U+202D>  Much the most lovd of all that live to me.
<U+202D>  _Who kills a guiltless man from man may fly,
<U+202D>  From God his searches all escapes deny._
<U+202D>     Thus cheerd his words, but his affections still
<U+202D>  Feard not to cherish foul intent to kill
<U+202D>  Evn him whose life to all lives he preferrd.
<U+202D>     The queen went up, and to her love appeard
<U+202D>  Her lord so freshly, that she wept, till sleep
<U+202D>  (By Pallas forcd on her) her eyes did steep
<U+202D>  In his sweet humour.  When the even was come,
<U+202D>  The God-like herdsman reachd the whole way home.
<U+202D>  Ulysses and his son for supper drest
<U+202D>  A year-old swine, and ere their host and guest
<U+202D>  Had got their presence, Pallas had put by
<U+202D>  With her fair rod Ulysses royalty,
<U+202D>  And renderd him an aged man again,
<U+202D>  With all his vile integuments, lest his swain
<U+202D>  Should know him in his trim, and tell his queen,
<U+202D>  In these deep secrets being not deeply seen.
<U+202D>     He seen, to him the prince these words did use:
<U+202D>  Welcome divine Eumaus!  Now what news
<U+202D>  Employs the city?  Are the Wooers come
<U+202D>  Back from their scout dismayd?  Or here at home
<U+202D>  Will they again attempt me?  He replied:
<U+202D>  These touch not my care.  I was satisfied
<U+202D>  To do, with most speed, what I went to do;
<U+202D>  My message done, return.  And yet, not so
<U+202D>  Came my news first; a herald (met with there)
<U+202D>  Forestalld my tale, and told how safe you were.
<U+202D>  Besides which merely necessary thing,
<U+202D>  What in my way chancd I may over-bring,
<U+202D>  Being what I know, and witnessd with mine eyes.
<U+202D>     Where the Hermaan sepulchre doth rise
<U+202D>  Above the city, I beheld take port
<U+202D>  A ship, and in her many a man of sort;
<U+202D>  Her freight was shields and lances; and, methought,
<U+202D>  They were the Wooers; but, of knowledge, nought
<U+202D>  Can therein tell you.  The prince smild, and knew
<U+202D>  They were the Wooers, casting secret view
<U+202D>  Upon his father.  But what they intended
<U+202D>  Fled far the herdsman; whose swains labours ended,
<U+202D>  They dressd the supper, which, past want, was eat.
<U+202D>  When all desire sufficd of wine and meat,
<U+202D>  Of other human wants they took supplies
<U+202D>  At Sleeps soft hand, who sweetly closd their eyes.
