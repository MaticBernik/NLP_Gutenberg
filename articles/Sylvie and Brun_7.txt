Why, its raining cats and dogs! I said.
And all the _dogs_ has come down _first_, said Bruno: theres nothing
but _cats_ coming down now!
In another minute the pattering ceased, as suddenly as it had begun. I
stepped out from under the tree, and found that the storm was over; but
I looked in vain, on my return, for my tiny companions. They had
vanished with the storm, and there was nothing for it but to make the
best of my way home.
On the table lay, awaiting my return, an envelope of that peculiar
yellow tint which always announces a telegram, and which must be, in the
memories of so many of us, inseparably linked with some great and sudden
sorrowsomething that has cast a shadow, never in this world to be
wholly lifted off, on the brightness of Life. No doubt it has _also_
heraldedfor many of ussome sudden news of joy; but this, I think, is
less common: human life seems, on the whole, to contain more of sorrow
than of joy. And yet the world goes on. Who knows why?
This time, however, there was no shock of sorrow to be faced: in fact,
the few words it contained (Could not bring myself to write. Come soon.
Always welcome. A letter follows this. Arthur.) seemed so like Arthur
himself speaking, that it gave me quite a thrill of pleasure, and I at
once began the preparations needed for the journey.
                              CHAPTER II.
                             LOVES CURFEW.
Fayfield Junction! Change for Elveston!
What subtle memory could there be, linked to these commonplace words,
that caused such a flood of happy thoughts to fill my brain? I
dismounted from the carriage in a state of joyful excitement for which I
could not at first account. True, I had taken this very journey, and at
the same hour of the day, six months ago; but many things had happened
since then, and an old mans memory has but a slender hold on recent
events: I sought the missing link in vain. Suddenly I caught sight of
a benchthe only one provided on the cheerless platformwith a lady
seated on it, and the whole forgotten scene flashed upon me as vividly
as if it were happening over again.
Yes, I thought. This bare platform is, for me, rich with the memory
of a dear friend! She was sitting on that very bench, and invited me to
share it, with some quotation from ShakespeareI forget what. Ill try
the Earls plan for the Dramatisation of Life, and fancy that figure to
be Lady Muriel; and I wont undeceive myself too soon!
So I strolled along the platform, resolutely making-believe (as
children say) that the casual passenger, seated on that bench, was the
Lady Muriel I remembered so well. She was facing away from me, which
aided the elaborate cheatery I was practising on myself: but, though I
was careful, in passing the spot, to look the other way, in order to
prolong the pleasant illusion, it was inevitable that, when I turned to
walk back again, I should see who it was. It was Lady Muriel herself!
