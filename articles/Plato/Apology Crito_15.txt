At length Crito admits that he has no answer to make, and Socrates
resolves to submit himself to the will of Providence.
CRITO;
OR,
THE DUTY OF A CITIZEN.
SOCRATES, CRITO.
_Socr._ Why have you come at this hour, Crito? Is it not very early?
_Cri._ It is.
_Socr._ About what time?
_Cri._ Scarce day-break.
_Socr._ I wonder how the keeper of the prison came to admit you.
_Cri._ He is familiar with me, Socrates, from my having frequently come
hither; and he is under some obligations to me.
_Socr._ Have you just now come, or some time since?
_Cri._ A considerable time since.
_Socr._ Why, then, did you not wake me at once, instead of sitting down
by me in silence?
_Cri._ By Jupiter! Socrates, I should not myself like to be so long
awake, and in such affliction. But I have been for some time wondering
at you, perceiving how sweetly you slept; and I purposely did not awake
you, that you might pass your time as pleasantly as possible. And,
indeed, I have often before throughout your whole life considered you
happy in your disposition, but far more so in the present calamity,
seeing how easily and meekly you bear it.
_Socr._ However, Crito, it would be disconsonant for a man at my time of
life to repine because he must needs die.
_Cri._ But others, Socrates, at your age have been involved in similar
calamities, yet their age has not hindered their repining at their
present fortune.
_Socr._ So it is. But why did you come so early?
_Cri._ Bringing sad tidings, Socrates, not sad to you, as it appears,
but to me, and all your friends, sad and heavy, and which I, I think,
shall bear worst of all.
_Socr._ What tidings? Has the ship[6] arrived from Delos, on the arrival
of which I must die?
_Cri._ It has not yet arrived, but it appears to me that it will come
to-day, from what certain persons report who have come from Sunium,[7]
and left it there. It is clear, therefore, from these messengers, that
it will come to day, and consequently it will be necessary, Socrates,
for you to die to-morrow.
2. _Socr._ But with good fortune, Crito, and if so it please the gods,
so be it. I do not think, however, that it will come to day.
_Cri._ Whence do you form this conjecture?
_Socr._ I will tell you. I must die on the day after that on which the
ship arrives.
_Cri._ So they say[8] who have the control of these things.
_Socr._ I do not think, then, that it will come to-day, but to-morrow. I
conjecture this from a dream which I had this very night, not long ago,
and you seem very opportunely to have refrained from waking me.
_Cri._ But what was this dream?
_Socr._ A beautiful and majestic woman, clad in white garments seemed to
approach me, and to call to me and say, "Socrates, three days hence you
will reach fertile Pythia"[9].
