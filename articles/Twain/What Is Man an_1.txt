O.M. What was his state of mind on his way home?
Y.M. It was a state of joy which only the self-sacrificer knows. His
heart sang, he was unconscious of the storm.
O.M. He felt well?
Y.M. One cannot doubt it.
O.M. Very well. Now let us add up the details and see how much he got
for his twenty-five cents. Let us try to find out the _real_ why of his
making the investment. In the first place _he_ couldn't bear the pain
which the old suffering face gave him. So he was thinking of _his_
pain--this good man. He must buy a salve for it. If he did not succor
the old woman _his_ conscience would torture him all the way home.
Thinking of _his_ pain again. He must buy relief for that. If he didn't
relieve the old woman _he_ would not get any sleep. He must buy some
sleep--still thinking of _himself_, you see. Thus, to sum up, he bought
himself free of a sharp pain in his heart, he bought himself free of the
tortures of a waiting conscience, he bought a whole night's sleep--all
for twenty-five cents! It should make Wall Street ashamed of itself. On
his way home his heart was joyful, and it sang--profit on top of profit!
The impulse which moved the man to succor the old woman was--_first_--to
_content his own spirit_; secondly to relieve _her_ sufferings. Is it
your opinion that men's acts proceed from one central and unchanging and
inalterable impulse, or from a variety of impulses?
Y.M. From a variety, of course--some high and fine and noble, others
not. What is your opinion?
O.M. Then there is but _one_ law, one source.
Y.M. That both the noblest impulses and the basest proceed from that one
source?
O.M. Yes.
Y.M. Will you put that law into words?
O.M. Yes. This is the law, keep it in your mind. _From his cradle to his
grave a man never does a single thing which has any_ FIRST AND FOREMOST
_object_ _but one_--_to secure peace of mind, spiritual comfort_,
_for_ HIMSELF.
Y.M. Come! He never does anything for any one else's comfort, spiritual
or physical?
O.M. No. _except on those distinct terms_--that it shall _first_ secure
_his own_ spiritual comfort. Otherwise he will not do it.
Y.M. It will be easy to expose the falsity of that proposition.
O.M. For instance?
Y.M. Take that noble passion, love of country, patriotism. A man who
loves peace and dreads pain, leaves his pleasant home and his weeping
family and marches out to manfully expose himself to hunger, cold,
wounds, and death. Is that seeking spiritual comfort?
O.M. He loves peace and dreads pain?
Y.M. Yes.
O.M. Then perhaps there is something that he loves _more_ than he loves
peace--_the approval of his neighbors and the public_. And perhaps there
is something which he dreads more than he dreads pain--the _disapproval_
of his neighbors and the public. If he is sensitive to shame he will
go to the field--not because his spirit will be _entirely_ comfortable
there, but because it will be more comfortable there than it would be
if he remained at home. He will always do the thing which will bring him
the _most_ mental comfort--for that is _the sole law of his life_.
He leaves the weeping family behind; he is sorry to make them
uncomfortable, but not sorry enough to sacrifice his _own_ comfort to
secure theirs.
