I was in trouble, for how would Marget live? Ursula could not find a
coin in the road every day--perhaps not even a second one. And I was
ashamed, too, for not having been near Marget, and she so in need of
friends; but that was my parents fault, not mine, and I couldnt help
it.
I was walking along the path, feeling very downhearted, when a most
cheery and tingling freshening-up sensation went rippling through me,
and I was too glad for any words, for I knew by that sign that Satan
was by. I had noticed it before. Next moment he was alongside of me
and I was telling him all my trouble and what had been happening to
Marget and her uncle. While we were talking we turned a curve and saw
old Ursula resting in the shade of a tree, and she had a lean stray
kitten in her lap and was petting it. I asked her where she got it, and
she said it came out of the woods and followed her; and she said it
probably hadnt any mother or any friends and she was going to take it
home and take care of it. Satan said:
I understand you are very poor. Why do you want to add another mouth
to feed? Why dont you give it to some rich person?
Ursula bridled at this and said: Perhaps you would like to have it.
You must be rich, with your fine clothes and quality airs. Then she
sniffed and said: Give it to the rich--the idea! The rich dont care
for anybody but themselves; its only the poor that have feeling for
the poor, and help them. The poor and God. God will provide for this
kitten.
What makes you think so?
Ursulas eyes snapped with anger. Because I know it! she said. Not a
sparrow falls to the ground without His seeing it.
But it falls, just the same. What good is seeing it fall?
Old Ursulas jaws worked, but she could not get any word out for the
moment, she was so horrified. When she got her tongue she stormed out,
Go about your business, you puppy, or I will take a stick to you!
I could not speak, I was so scared. I knew that with his notions about
the human race Satan would consider it a matter of no consequence to
strike her dead, there being plenty more; but my tongue stood still,
I could give her no warning. But nothing happened; Satan remained
tranquil--tranquil and indifferent. I suppose he could not be insulted
by Ursula any more than the king could be insulted by a tumble-bug.
The old woman jumped to her feet when she made her remark, and did it
as briskly as a young girl. It had been many years since she had done
the like of that. That was Satans influence; he was a fresh breeze to
the weak and the sick, wherever he came. His presence affected even
the lean kitten, and it skipped to the ground and began to chase a
leaf. This surprised Ursula, and she stood looking at the creature and
nodding her head wonderingly, her anger quite forgotten.
