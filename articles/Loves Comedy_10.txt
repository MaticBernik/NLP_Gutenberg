STIVER.
And sometimes to the quick.
FALK.
                           You've had to wince
Beneath a crushing load of obligations
That you'd send packing, if good form permitted.
That's what's the matter.
STIVER.
                          Monstrous accusations!
My legal debts I've honestly acquitted;
But other bonds next month are falling due;
                                    [To GULDSTAD.
When a man weds, you see, he gets a wife--
FALK [triumphant].
Now your youth's heaven once again is blue;
There rang an echo from your old song-life!
That's how it is: I read you thro' and thro';
Wings, wings were all you wanted,--and a knife!
STIVER.
A knife?
FALK.
         Yes, Resolution's knife, to sever
Each captive bond, and set you free for ever,
To soar--
STIVER [angrily].
           Nay, now you're insolent beyond
Endurance!  Me to charge with violation
Of law,--me, me with plotting to abscond!
It's libellous, malicious defamation,
Insult and calumny--
FALK.
                      Are you insane?
What is all this about?  Explain!  Explain!
GULDSTAD [laughingly to STIVER].
Yes, clear your mind of all this balderdash!
What do you want?
STIVER [pulling himself together].
                  A trifling loan in cash.
FALK.
A loan!
STIVER [hurriedly to GULDSTAD].
        That is, I mean to say, you know,
A voucher for a ten pound note, or so.
MISS JAY [to LIND and ANNA].
I wish you joy!  How lovely, how delicious!
GULDSTAD [going up to the ladies].
Pray what has happened?
         [To himself.]  This was unpropitious.
FALK [throws his arms about STIVER's neck].
Hurrah! the trumpet's dulcet notes proclaim
A brother born to you in Amor's name!
                    [Drags him to the others.
MISS JAY [to the gentlemen].
Think! Lind and Anna--think!--have plighted hearts,
Affianced lovers!
MRS. HALM [with tears of emotion].
                  'Tis the eighth in order
Who well-provided from this house departs;
                                      [To FALK.
Seven nieces wedded-always with a boarder--
    [Is overcome; presses her handkerchief to her eyes.
MISS JAY [to ANNA].
Well, there will come a flood of gratulation!
                      [Caresses her with emotion.
LIND [seizing FALK's hand].
My friend, I walk in rapt intoxication!
FALK.
Hold!  As a plighted man you are a member
Of Rapture's Temperance-association.
Observe it's rules;--no orgies here, remember!
          [Turning to GULDSTAD sympathetically.
Well, my good sir!
GULDSTAD [beaming with pleasure].
                   I think this promises
All happiness for both.
FALK [staring at him].
                        You seem to stand
The shock with exemplary self-command.
That's well.
GULDSTAD.
             What do you mean, sir?
FALK.
                                    Only this;
That inasmuch as you appeared to feed
Fond expectations of your own--
GULDSTAD.
                                Indeed?
FALK.
At any rate, you were upon the scent.
You named Miss Halm; you stood upon this spot
And asked me--
GULDSTAD [smiling].
               There are two, though, are there not?
FALK.
It was--the other sister that you meant?
GULDSTAD.
That sister, yes, the other one,--just so.
Judge for yourself, when you have come to know
That sister better, if she has not in her
Merits which, if they were divined, would win her
A little more regard than we bestow.
FALK [coldly].
Her virtues are of every known variety
I'm sure.
GULDSTAD.
          Not quite; the accent of society
She cannot hit exactly; there she loses.
