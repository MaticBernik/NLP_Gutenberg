<U+202D>     Thence sad in heart we saild; and yet our state
<U+202D>  Was something cheerd, that (being oer-matchd so much
<U+202D>  In violent number) our retreat was such
<U+202D>  As savd so many.  Our dear loss the less,
<U+202D>  That they survivd, so like for like success.
<U+202D>  Yet left we not the coast, before we calld
<U+202D>  Home to our country-earth the souls exhald
<U+202D>  Of all the friends the Cicons overcame.
<U+202D>  Thrice calld we on them by their sevral name,  [5]
<U+202D>  And then took leave.  Then from the angry North
<U+202D>  Cloud-gathring Jove a dreadful storm calld forth
<U+202D>  Against our navy, coverd shore and all
<U+202D>  With gloomy vapours.  Night did headlong fall
<U+202D>  From frowning heavn.  And then hurld here and there
<U+202D>  Was all our navy; the rude winds did tear
<U+202D>  In three, in four parts, all their sails; and down
<U+202D>  Drivn under hatches were we, prest to drown.
<U+202D>  Up rushd we yet again, and with tough hand
<U+202D>  (Two days, two nights, entoild) we gat near land,
<U+202D>  Labours and sorrows eating up our minds.
<U+202D>  The third clear day yet, to more friendly winds
<U+202D>  We masts advancd, we white sails spread, and sate.
<U+202D>  Forewinds and guides again did iterate
<U+202D>  Our ease and home-hopes; which we clear had reachd,
<U+202D>  Had not, by chance, a sudden north-wind fetchd,
<U+202D>  With an extreme sea, quite about again
<U+202D>  Our whole endeavours, and our course constrain
<U+202D>  To giddy round, and with our bowd sails greet
<U+202D>  Dreadful Maleia, calling back our fleet
<U+202D>  As far forth as Cythera.  Nine days more
<U+202D>  Adverse winds tossd me; and the tenth, the shore,
<U+202D>  Where dwelt the blossom-fed Lotophagi,
<U+202D>  I fetchd, fresh water took in, instantly
<U+202D>  Fell to our food aship-board, and then sent
<U+202D>  Two of my choice men to the continent
<U+202D>  (Adding a third, a herald) to discover
<U+202D>  What sort of people were the rulers over
<U+202D>  The land next to us.  Where, the first they met,
<U+202D>  Were the Lotophagi, that made them eat
<U+202D>  Their country-diet, and no ill intent
<U+202D>  Hid in their hearts to them; and yet th event
<U+202D>  To ill converted it, for having eat
<U+202D>  Their dainty viands, they did quite forget
<U+202D>  (As all men else that did but taste their feast)
<U+202D>  Both countrymen and country, nor addrest
<U+202D>  Any return t inform what sort of men
<U+202D>  Made fixd abode there, but would needs maintain
<U+202D>  Abode themselves there, and eat that food ever.
<U+202D>  I made out after, and was feign to sever
<U+202D>  Th enchanted knot by forcing their retreat;
<U+202D>  That strivd, and wept, and would not leave their meat
<U+202D>  For heavn itself.  But, dragging them to fleet,
<U+202D>  I wrapt in sure bands both their hands and feet,
<U+202D>  And cast them under hatches, and away
<U+202D>  Commanded all the rest without least stay,
<U+202D>  Lest they should taste the lote too, and forget
<U+202D>  With such strange raptures their despisd retreat.
<U+202D>     All then aboard, we beat the sea with oars,
<U+202D>  And still with sad hearts saild by out-way shores,
<U+202D>  Till th out-lawd Cyclops land we fetchd; a race
<U+202D>  Of proud-livd loiterers, that never sow,
<U+202D>  Nor put a plant in earth, nor use a plow,
<U+202D>  But trust in God for all things; and their earth,
<U+202D>  Unsown, unplowd, gives evry offspring birth
<U+202D>  That other lands have; wheat, and barley, vines
<U+202D>  That bear in goodly grapes delicious wines;
<U+202D>  And Jove sends showrs for all.   No councils there,
<U+202D>  Nor councillors, nor laws; but all men bear
<U+202D>  Their heads aloft on mountains, and those steep,
<U+202D>  And on their tops too; and their houses keep
<U+202D>  In vaulty caves, their households governd all
<U+202D>  By each mans law, imposd in several,
<U+202D>  Nor wife, nor child awed, but as he thinks good,
<U+202D>  None for another caring.  But there stood
<U+202D>  Another little isle, well stord with wood,
<U+202D>  Betwixt this and the entry; neither nigh
<U+202D>  The Cyclops isle, nor yet far off doth lie,
<U+202D>  Mens want it sufferd, but the mens supplies
<U+202D>  The goats made with their inarticulate cries.
<U+202D>  Goats beyond number this small island breeds,
<U+202D>  So tame, that no access disturbs their feeds,
<U+202D>  No hunters, that the tops of mountains scale,
<U+202D>  And rub through woods with toil, seek them at all.
<U+202D>  Nor is the soil with flocks fed down, not plowd,
<U+202D>  Nor ever in it any seed was sowd.
<U+202D>  Nor place the neighbour Cyclops their delights
<U+202D>  In brave vermilion-prow-deckd ships; nor wrights
<U+202D>  Useful, and skilful in such works as need
<U+202D>  Perfection to those traffics that exceed
<U+202D>  Their natural confines, to fly out and see
<U+202D>  Cities of men, and take in mutually
<U+202D>  The prease of others; to themselves they live,
<U+202D>  And to their island that enough would give
<U+202D>  A good inhabitant; and time of year
<U+202D>  Observe to all things art could order there.
<U+202D>  There, close upon the sea, sweet meadows spring;
<U+202D>  That yet of fresh streams want no watering
<U+202D>  To their soft burthens, but of special yield.
<U+202D>  Your vines would be there; and your common field
<U+202D>  But gentle work make for your plow, yet bear
<U+202D>  A lofty harvest when you came to shear;
<U+202D>  For passing fat the soil is.  In it lies
<U+202D>  A harbour so oppórtune, that no ties,
<U+202D>  Halsers, or gables need, nor anchors cast.
<U+202D>  Whom storms put in there are with stay embracd,  [6]
<U+202D>  Or to their full wills safe, or winds aspire
<U+202D>  To pilots uses their more quick desire.
<U+202D>  At entry of the haven, a silver ford
<U+202D>  Is from a rock-impressing fountain pourd,
<U+202D>  All set with sable poplars.  And this port
<U+202D>  Were we arrivd at, by the sweet resort
<U+202D>  Of some God guiding us, for twas a night
<U+202D>  So ghastly dark all port was past our sight,
<U+202D>  Clouds hid our ships, and would not let the moon
<U+202D>  Afford a beam to us, the whole isle won
<U+202D>  By not an eye of ours.  None thought the blore,
<U+202D>  That then was up, shovd waves against the shore,
<U+202D>  That then to an unmeasurd height put on;
<U+202D>  We still at sea esteemd us, till alone
<U+202D>  Our fleet put in itself.  And then were strook
<U+202D>  Our gatherd sails; our rest ashore we took,
<U+202D>  And day expected.  When the morn gave fire,
<U+202D>  We rose, and walkd, and did the isle admire;
<U+202D>  The Nymphs, Joves daughters, putting up a herd
<U+202D>  Of mountain goats to us, to render cheerd
<U+202D>  My fellow soldiers.  To our fleet we flew,
<U+202D>  Our crooked bows took, long-pild darts, and drew
<U+202D>  Ourselves in three parts out; when, by the grace
<U+202D>  That God vouchsafd, we made a gainful chace.
<U+202D>  Twelve ships we had, and evry ship had nine
<U+202D>  Fat goats allotted [it], ten only mine.
<U+202D>  Thus all that day, evn till the sun was set,
<U+202D>  We sat and feasted, pleasant wine and meat
<U+202D>  Plenteously taking; for we had not spent
<U+202D>  Our ruddy wine aship-board, supplement
<U+202D>  Of large sort each man to his vessel drew,
<U+202D>  When we the sacred city overthrew
<U+202D>  That held the Cicons.  Now then saw we near
<U+202D>  The Cyclops late-praisd island, and might hear
<U+202D>  The murmur of their sheep and goats, and see
<U+202D>  Their smokes ascend.  The sun then set, and we,
<U+202D>  When night succeeded, took our rest ashore.
<U+202D>  And when the world the mornings favour wore,
<U+202D>  I calld my friends to council, charging them
<U+202D>  To make stay there, while I took ship and stream,
<U+202D>  With some associates, and explord what men
<U+202D>  The neighbour isle held; if of rude disdain,
<U+202D>  Churlish and tyrannous, or minds bewrayd
<U+202D>  Pious and hospitable.  Thus much said,
<U+202D>  I boarded, and commanded to ascend
<U+202D>  My friends and soldiers, to put off, and lend
<U+202D>  Way to our ship.  They boarded, sat, and beat
<U+202D>  The old sea forth, till we might see the seat
<U+202D>  The greatest Cyclop held for his abode,
<U+202D>  Which was a deep cave, near the common road
<U+202D>  Of ships that touchd there, thick with laurels spread,
<U+202D>  Where many sheep and goats lay shadowéd;
<U+202D>  And, near to this, a hall of torn-up stone,
<U+202D>  High built with pines, that heavn and earth attone,
<U+202D>  And lofty-fronted oaks; in which kept house
<U+202D>  A man in shape immane, and monsterous,
<U+202D>  Fed all his flocks alone, nor would afford
<U+202D>  Commerce with men, but had a wit abhorrd,
<U+202D>  His mind his body answring.  Nor was he
<U+202D>  Like any man that food could possibly
<U+202D>  Enhance so hugely, but, beheld alone,
<U+202D>  Showd like a steep hills top, all overgrown
<U+202D>  With trees and brambles;  little thought had I
<U+202D>  Of such vast objects.  When, arrivd so nigh,
<U+202D>  Some of my lovd friends I made stay aboard,
<U+202D>  To guard my ship;  and twelve with me I shord,
<U+202D>  The choice of all.  I took besides along
<U+202D>  A goat-skin flagon of wine, black and strong,
<U+202D>  That Maro did present, Evantheus son,
<U+202D>  And priest to Phobus, who had mansión
<U+202D>  In Thracian Ismarus (the town I took).
<U+202D>  He gave it me, since I (with revrence strook
<U+202D>  Of his grave place, his wife and childrens good)
<U+202D>  Freed all of violence.  Amidst a wood,
<U+202D>  Sacred to Phobus, stood his house; from whence
<U+202D>  He fetchd me gifts of varied excellence;
<U+202D>  Sevn talents of fine gold; a bowl all framd
<U+202D>  Of massy silver; but his gift most famd
<U+202D>  Was twelve great vessels, filld with such rich wine
<U+202D>  As was incorruptible and divine.
<U+202D>  He kept it as his jewel, which none knew
<U+202D>  But he himself, his wife, and he that drew.
<U+202D>  It was so strong that never any filld
<U+202D>  A cup, where that was but by drops instilld,
<U+202D>  And drunk it off, but twas before allayd
<U+202D>  With twenty parts in water; yet so swayd
<U+202D>  The spirit of that little, that the whole
<U+202D>  A sacred odour breathd about the bowl.
<U+202D>  Had you the odour smelt and scent it cast,
<U+202D>  It would have vexd you to forbear the taste.
<U+202D>  But then, the taste gaind too, the spirit it wrought
<U+202D>  To dare things high set-up-an-end my thought.
<U+202D>     Of this a huge great flagon full I bore,
<U+202D>  And, in a good large knapsack, victuals store;
<U+202D>  And longd to see this heap of fortitude,
<U+202D>  That so illitrate was and upland rude
<U+202D>  That laws divine nor human he had learnd.
<U+202D>  With speed we reachd the cavern; nor discernd
<U+202D>  His presence there, his flocks he fed at field.
<U+202D>     Entring his den, each thing beheld did yield
<U+202D>  Our admiration; shelves with cheeses heapd;
<U+202D>  Sheds stuffd with lambs and goats, distinctly kept,
<U+202D>  Distinct the biggest, the more mean distinct,
<U+202D>  Distinct the youngest.  And in their precinct,
<U+202D>  Proper and placeful, stood the troughs and pails,
<U+202D>  In which he milkd; and what was givn at meals,
<U+202D>  Set up a creaming; in the evning still
<U+202D>  All scouring bright as dew upon the hill.
<U+202D>     Then were my fellows instant to convey
<U+202D>  Kids, cheeses, lambs, aship-board, and away
<U+202D>  Sail the salt billow.  I thought best not so,
<U+202D>  But better otherwise; and first would know,
<U+202D>  What guest-gifts he would spare me.  Little knew
<U+202D>  My friends on whom they would have preyd.  His view
<U+202D>  Provd after, that his inwards were too rough
<U+202D>  For such bold usage.  We were bold enough
<U+202D>  In what I sufferd; which was there to stay,
<U+202D>  Make fire and feed there, though bear none away.
<U+202D>  There sat we, till we saw him feeding come,
<U+202D>  And on his neck a burthen lugging home,
<U+202D>  Most highly huge, of sere-wood, which the pile
<U+202D>  That fed his fire supplied all supper-while.
<U+202D>  Down by his den he threw it, and up rose
<U+202D>  A tumult with the fall.  Afraid, we close
<U+202D>  Withdrew ourselves, while he into a cave
<U+202D>  Of huge receipt his high-fed cattle drave,
<U+202D>  All that he milkd; the males he left without
<U+202D>  His lofty roofs, that all bestrowd about
<U+202D>  With rams and buck-goats were.  And then a rock
<U+202D>  He lift aloft, that dammd up to his flock
<U+202D>  The door they enterd; twas so hard to wield,
<U+202D>  That two-and-twenty waggons, all four-wheeld,
<U+202D>  (Could they be loaded, and have teams that were
<U+202D>  Proportiond to them) could not stir it there.
<U+202D>  Thus making sure, he kneeld and milkd his ewes,
<U+202D>  And braying goats, with all a milkers dues;
<U+202D>  Then let in all their young.  Then quick did dress
<U+202D>  His half milk up for cheese, and in a press
<U+202D>  Of wicker pressd it; put in bowls the rest,
<U+202D>  To drink and eat, and serve his supping feast.
<U+202D>     All works dispatchd thus, he began his fire;
<U+202D>  Which blown, he saw us, and did thus inquire:
<U+202D>     <U+1FFE>Ho! guests!  What are ye?  Whence sail ye these seas?
<U+202D>  Traffic, or rove ye, and like thieves oppress
<U+202D>  Poor strange adventurers, exposing so
<U+202D>  Your souls to danger, and your lives to woe?
<U+202D>     This utterd he, when fear from our hearts took
<U+202D>  The very life, to be so thunder-strook
<U+202D>  With such a voice, and such a monster see;
<U+202D>  But thus I answerd:  Erring Grecians, we
<U+202D>  From Troy were turning homewards, but by force
<U+202D>  Of adverse winds, in far diverted course,
<U+202D>  Such unknown ways took, and on rude seas tossd,
<U+202D>  As Jove decreed, are cast upon this coast,
<U+202D>  Of Agamemnon, famous Atreus son,
<U+202D>  We boast ourselves the soldiers; who hath won  [7]
<U+202D>  Renown that reacheth heavn, to overthrow
<U+202D>  So great a city, and to ruin so
<U+202D>  So many nations.  Yet at thy knees lie
<U+202D>  Our prostrate bosoms, forcd with prayrs to try
<U+202D>  If any hospitable right, or boon
<U+202D>  Of other nature, such as have been won
<U+202D>  By laws of other houses, thou wilt give.
<U+202D>  Revrence the Gods, thou greatst of all that live.
<U+202D>  We suppliants are; and hospitable Jove
<U+202D>  Pours wreak on all whom prayrs want powr to move,
<U+202D>  And with their plagues together will provide
<U+202D>  That humble guests shall have their wants supplied.
<U+202D>     He cruelly answerd:  O thou fool,  said he,
<U+202D>  To come so far, and to importune me
<U+202D>  With any Gods fear, or observéd love!
<U+202D>  We Cyclops care not for your goat-fed Jove,
<U+202D>  Nor other Blessd ones; we are better far.
<U+202D>  To Jove himself dare I bid open war,
<U+202D>  To thee, and all thy fellows, if I please.
<U+202D>  But tell me, wheres the ship, that by the seas
<U+202D>  Hath brought thee hither?  If far off, or near,
<U+202D>  Inform me quickly.  These his temptings were;
<U+202D>  But I too much knew not to know his mind,
<U+202D>  And craft with craft paid, telling him the wind
<U+202D>  (Thrust up from sea by Him that shakes the shore)
<U+202D>  Had dashd our ships against his rocks, and tore
<U+202D>  Her ribs in pieces close upon his coast,
<U+202D>  And we from high wrack savd, the rest were lost.
<U+202D>     He answerd nothing, but rushd in, and took
<U+202D>  Two of my fellows up from earth, and strook
<U+202D>  Their brains against it.  Like two whelps they flew
<U+202D>  About his shoulders, and did all embrue
<U+202D>  The blushing earth.  No mountain lion tore
<U+202D>  Two lambs so sternly, lappd up all their gore
<U+202D>  Gushd from their torn-up bodies, limb by limb
<U+202D>  (Trembling with life yet) ravishd into him.
<U+202D>  Both flesh and marrow-stufféd bones he eat,
<U+202D>  And evn th uncleanséd entrails made his meat.
<U+202D>  We, weeping, cast our hands to heavn, to view
<U+202D>  A sight so horrid.  Desperation flew,
<U+202D>  With all our after lives, to instant death,
<U+202D>  In our believd destruction.  But when breath
<U+202D>  The fury of his appetite had got,
<U+202D>  Because the gulf his belly reachd his throat,
<U+202D>  Mans flesh, and goats milk, laying layr on layr,
<U+202D>  Till near chokd up was all the pass for air,
<U+202D>  Along his den, amongst his cattle, down
<U+202D>  He rushd, and streakd him.  When my mind was grown
<U+202D>  Desprate to step in, draw my sword, and part
<U+202D>  His bosom where the strings about the heart
<U+202D>  Circle the liver, and add strength of hand.
<U+202D>  But that rash thought, more stayd, did countermand,
<U+202D>  For there we all had perishd, since it past
<U+202D>  Our powrs to lift aside a log so vast,
<U+202D>  As barrd all outscape; and so sighd away
<U+202D>  The thought all night, expecting active day.
<U+202D>  Which come, he first of all his fire enflames,
<U+202D>  Then milks his goats and ewes, then to their dams
<U+202D>  Lets in their young, and, wondrous orderly,
<U+202D>  With manly haste dispatchd his housewifry.
<U+202D>  Then to his breakfast, to which other two
<U+202D>  Of my poor friends went; which eat, out then go
<U+202D>  His herds and fat flocks, lightly putting by
<U+202D>  The churlish bar, and closd it instantly;
<U+202D>  For both those works with ease as much he did,
<U+202D>  As you would ope and shut your quiver lid.
<U+202D>     With storms of whistlings then his flock he drave
<U+202D>  Up to the mountains; and occasion gave
<U+202D>  For me to use my wits, which to their height
<U+202D>  I strivd to screw up, that a vengeance might
<U+202D>  By some means fall from thence, and Pallas now
<U+202D>  Afford a full ear to my neediest vow.
<U+202D>  This then my thoughts preferrd: A huge club lay
<U+202D>  Close by his milk-house, which was now in way
<U+202D>  To dry and season, being an olive-tree
<U+202D>  Which late he felld, and, being green, must be
<U+202D>  Made lighter for his manage.  Twas so vast,
<U+202D>  That we resembled it to some fit mast,
<U+202D>  To serve a ship of burthen that was drivn
<U+202D>  With twenty oars, and had a bigness givn
<U+202D>  To bear a huge sea.  Full so thick, so tall,
<U+202D>  We judgd this club; which I, in part, hewd small,
<U+202D>  And cut a fathom off.  The piece I gave
<U+202D>  Amongst my soldiers, to take down, and shave;
<U+202D>  Which done, I sharpend it at top, and then,
<U+202D>  Hardend in fire, I hid it in the den
<U+202D>  Within a nasty dunghill reeking there,
<U+202D>  Thick, and so moist it issued evrywhere.
<U+202D>  Then made I lots cast by my friends to try
<U+202D>  Whose fortune servd to dare the bord-out eye
<U+202D>  Of that man-eater; and the lot did fall
<U+202D>  On four I wishd to make my aid of all,
<U+202D>  And I the fifth made, chosen like the rest.
<U+202D>     Then came the even, and he came from the feast
<U+202D>  Of his fat cattle, drave in all; nor kept
<U+202D>  One male abroad; if, or his memory slept
<U+202D>  By Gods direct will, or of purpose was
<U+202D>  His driving in of all then, doth surpass
<U+202D>  My comprehension.  But he closd again
<U+202D>  The mighty bar, milkd, and did still maintain
<U+202D>  All other observation as before.
<U+202D>  His work all done, two of my soldiers more
<U+202D>  At once he snatchd up, and to supper went.
<U+202D>  Then dard I words to him, and did present
<U+202D>  A bowl of wine, with these words:  Cyclop!  take
<U+202D>  A bowl of wine, from my hand, that may make
<U+202D>  Way for the mans flesh thou hast eat, and show
<U+202D>  What drink our ship held; which in sacred vow
<U+202D>  I offer to thee to take ruth on me
<U+202D>  In my dismission home.  Thy rages be
<U+202D>  Now no more sufferable.  How shall men,
<U+202D>  Mad and inhuman that thou art, again
<U+202D>  Greet thy abode, and get thy actions grace,
<U+202D>  If thus thou ragest, and eatst up their race.
<U+202D>     He took, and drunk, and vehemently joyd
<U+202D>  To taste the sweet cup; and again employd
<U+202D>  My flagons powrs, entreating more, and said:
<U+202D>  <U+1FFE>Good guest, again afford my taste thy aid,
<U+202D>  And let me know thy name, and quickly now,
<U+202D>  That in thy recompense I may bestow
<U+202D>  A hospitable gift on thy desert,
<U+202D>  And such a one as shall rejoice thy heart.
<U+202D>  For to the Cyclops too the gentle earth
<U+202D>  Bears genrous wine, and Jove augments her birth,
<U+202D>  In store of such, with showrs; but this rich wine
<U+202D>  Fell from the river, that is mere divine,
<U+202D>  Of nectar and ambrosia.  This again
<U+202D>  I gave him, and again; nor could the fool abstain,
<U+202D>  But drunk as often.  When the noble juice
<U+202D>  Had wrought upon his spirit, I then gave use
<U+202D>  To fairer language, saying: Cyclop! now,
<U+202D>  As thou demandst, Ill tell my name, do thou
<U+202D>  Make good thy hospitable gift to me.
<U+202D>  My name is No-Man;  No-Man each degree
<U+202D>  Of friends, as well as parents, call my name.
<U+202D>  He answerd, as his cruel soul became:
<U+202D>  No-Man!  Ill eat thee last of all thy friends;
<U+202D>  And this is that in which so much amends
<U+202D>  I vowd to thy deservings, thus shall be
<U+202D>  My hospitable gift made good to thee.
<U+202D>  This said, he upwards fell, but then bent round
<U+202D>  His fleshy neck; and Sleep, with all crowns crownd,
<U+202D>  Subdued the savage.  From his throat brake out
<U+202D>  My wine, with mans-flesh gobbets, like a spout,
<U+202D>  When, loaded with his cups, he lay and snord;
<U+202D>  And then took I the clubs end up, and gord
<U+202D>  The burning coal-heap, that the point might heat;
<U+202D>  Confirmd my fellows minds, lest Fear should let
<U+202D>  Their vowd assay, and make them fly my aid.
<U+202D>  Straight was the olive-lever, I had laid
<U+202D>  Amidst the huge fire to get hardning, hot,
<U+202D>  And glowd extremely, though twas green; which got
<U+202D>  From forth the cinders, close about me stood
<U+202D>  My hardy friends; but that which did the good
<U+202D>  Was Gods good inspiratión, that gave
<U+202D>  A spirit beyond the spirit they usd to have;
<U+202D>  Who took the olive spar, made keen before,
<U+202D>  And plungd it in his eye, and up I bore,
<U+202D>  Bent to the top close, and helpd pour it in,
<U+202D>  With all my forces.  And as you have seen
<U+202D>  A ship-wright bore a naval beam, he oft
<U+202D>  Thrusts at the augers froofe, works still aloft,
<U+202D>  And at the shank help others, with a cord
<U+202D>  Wound round about to make it sooner bord,
<U+202D>  All plying the round still; so into his eye
<U+202D>  The fiery stake we labourd to imply.
<U+202D>  Out gushd the blood that scalded, his eye-ball
<U+202D>  Thrust out a flaming vapour, that scorchd all
<U+202D>  His brows and eye-lids, his eye-strings did crack,
<U+202D>  As in the sharp and burning rafter brake.
<U+202D>  And as a smith, to harden any tool,
<U+202D>  Broad axe, or mattock, in his trough doth cool
<U+202D>  The red-hot substance, that so fervent is
<U+202D>  It makes the cold wave straight to seethe and hiss;
<U+202D>  So sod and hissd his eye about the stake.
<U+202D>  He roard withal, and all his cavern brake
<U+202D>  In claps like thunder.  We did frighted fly,
<U+202D>  Dispersd in corners.  He from forth his eye
<U+202D>  The fixed stake pluckd; after which the blood
<U+202D>  Flowd freshly forth; and, mad, he hurld the wood
<U+202D>  About his hovel.  Out he then did cry
<U+202D>  For other Cyclops, that in caverns by
<U+202D>  Upon a windy promontory dwelld;
<U+202D>  Who, hearing how impetuously he yelld,
<U+202D>  Rushd evry way about him, and inquird,
<U+202D>  What ill afflicted him, that he exspird
<U+202D>  Such horrid clamours, and in sacred Night
<U+202D>  To break their sleeps so?  Askd him, if his fright
<U+202D>  Came from some mortal that his flocks had drivn?
<U+202D>  Or if by craft, or might, his death were givn?
<U+202D>  He answerd from his den:  By craft, nor might,
<U+202D>  No-Man hath givn me death.  They then said right,
<U+202D>  If no man hurt thee, and thyself alone,
<U+202D>  That which is done to thee by Jove is done;
<U+202D>  And what great Jove inflicts no man can fly.
<U+202D>  Pray to thy Father yet, a Deity,
<U+202D>  And prove, from him if thou canst help acquire.
<U+202D>     Thus spake they, leaving him; when all-on-fire
<U+202D>  My heart with joy was, that so well my wit
<U+202D>  And name deceivd him; whom now pain did split,
<U+202D>  And groaning up and down he groping tried
<U+202D>  To find the stone, which found, he put aside;
<U+202D>  But in the door sat, feeling if he could
<U+202D>  (As his sheep issued) on some man lay hold;
<U+202D>  Esteeming me a fool, that could devise
<U+202D>  No stratagem to scape his gross surprise.
<U+202D>  But I, contending what I could invent
<U+202D>  My friends and me from death so eminent
<U+202D>  To get deliverd, all my wiles I wove
<U+202D>  (Life being the subject) and did this approve:
<U+202D>  Fat fleecy rams, most fair, and great, lay there,
<U+202D>  That did a burden like a violet bear.  [8]
<U+202D>  These, while this learnd-in-villainy did sleep,
<U+202D>  I yokd with osiers cut there, sheep to sheep,
<U+202D>  Three in a rank, and still the mid sheep bore
<U+202D>  A man about his belly, the two more
<U+202D>  Marchd on his each side for defence.  I then,
<U+202D>  Choosing myself the fairest of the den,
<U+202D>  His fleecy belly under-crept, embracd
<U+202D>  His back, and in his rich wool wrapt me fast
<U+202D>  With both my hands, armd with as fast a mind.
<U+202D>  And thus each man hung, till the morning shind;
<U+202D>  Which come, he knew the hour, and let abroad
<U+202D>  His male-flocks first, the females unmilkd stood
<U+202D>  Bleating and braying, their full bags so sore
<U+202D>  With being unemptied, but their shepherd more
<U+202D>  With being unsighted; which was cause his mind
<U+202D>  Went not a milking.  He, to wreak inclind,
<U+202D>  The backs felt, as they passd, of those male dams,
<U+202D>  Gross fool!  believing, we would ride his rams!
<U+202D>  Nor ever knew that any of them bore
<U+202D>  Upon his belly any man before.
<U+202D>  The last ram came to pass him, with his wool
<U+202D>  And me together loaded to the full,
<U+202D>  For there did I hang; and that ram he stayd,
<U+202D>  And me withal had in his hands, my head
<U+202D>  Troubled the while, not causelessly, nor least.
<U+202D>  This ram he gropd, and talkd to:  Lazy beast!
<U+202D>  Why last art thou now?  Thou hast never usd
<U+202D>  To lag thus hindmost, but still first hast bruisd
<U+202D>  The tender blossom of a flowr, and held
<U+202D>  State in thy steps, both to the flood and field,
<U+202D>  First still at fold at even, now last remain?
<U+202D>  Dost thou not wish I had mine eye again,
<U+202D>  Which that abhorrd man No-Man did put out,
<U+202D>  Assisted by his execrable rout,
<U+202D>  When he had wrought me down with wine?  But he
<U+202D>  Must not escape my wreak so cunningly.
<U+202D>  I would to heavn thou knewst, and could but speak,
<U+202D>  To tell me where he lurks now!  I would break
<U+202D>  His brain about my cave, strewd here and there,
<U+202D>  To ease my heart of those foul ills, that were
<U+202D>  Th inflictions of a man I prizd at nought.
<U+202D>     Thus let he him abroad; when I, once brought
<U+202D>  A little from his hold, myself first losd,
<U+202D>  And next my friends.  Then drave we, and disposd,
<U+202D>  His straight-leggd fat fleece-bearers over land,
<U+202D>  Evn till they all were in my ships command;
<U+202D>  And to our lovd friends showd our prayd-for sight,
<U+202D>  Escapd from death.  But, for our loss, outright
<U+202D>  They brake in tears; which with a look I stayd,
<U+202D>  And bade them take our boot in.  They obeyd,
<U+202D>  And up we all went, sat, and usd our oars.
<U+202D>  But having left as far the savage shores
<U+202D>  As one might hear a voice, we then might see
<U+202D>  The Cyclop at the haven; when instantly
<U+202D>  I stayd our oars, and this insultance usd:
<U+202D>  <U+1FFE>Cyclop!  thou shouldst not have so much abusd
<U+202D>  Thy monstrous forces, to oppose their least
<U+202D>  Against a man immartial, and a guest,
<U+202D>  And eat his fellows.  Thou mightst know there were
<U+202D>  Some ills behind, rude swain, for thee to bear,
<U+202D>  That feard not to devour thy guests, and break
<U+202D>  All laws of humans.  Jove sends therefore wreak,
<U+202D>  And all the Gods, by me.  This blew the more
<U+202D>  His burning fury; when the top he tore
<U+202D>  From off a huge rock, and so right a throw
<U+202D>  Made at our ship, that just before the prow
<U+202D>  It overflew and fell, missd mast and all
<U+202D>  Exceeding little; but about the fall
<U+202D>  So fierce a wave it raisd, that back it bore
<U+202D>  Our ship so far, it almost touchd the shore.
<U+202D>  A bead-hook then, a far-extended one,
<U+202D>  I snatchd up, thrust hard, and so set us gone
<U+202D>  Some little way; and straight commanded all
<U+202D>  To help me with their oars, on pain to fall
<U+202D>  Again on our confusion.  But a sign
<U+202D>  I with my head made, and their oars were mine
<U+202D>  In all performance.  When we off were set,
<U+202D>  (Then first, twice further) my heart was so great,
<U+202D>  It would again provoke him, but my men
<U+202D>  On all sides rushd about me, to contain,
<U+202D>  And said:  Unhappy! why will you provoke
<U+202D>  A man so rude, that with so dead a stroke,
<U+202D>  Givn with his rock-dart, made the sea thrust back
<U+202D>  Our ship so far, and near hand forcd our wrack?
<U+202D>  Should he again but hear your voice resound,
<U+202D>  And any word reach, thereby would be found
<U+202D>  His darts direction, which would, in his fall,
<U+202D>  Crush piece-meal us, quite split our ship and all;
<U+202D>  So much dart wields the monster.  Thus urgd they
<U+202D>  Impossible things, in fear; but I gave way
<U+202D>  To that wrath which so long I held deprest,
<U+202D>  By great necessity conquerd, in my breast:
<U+202D>  Cyclop!  if any ask thee, who imposd  [9]
<U+202D>  Th unsightly blemish that thine eye enclosd,
<U+202D>  Say that Ulysses, old Laertes son,
<U+202D>  Whose seat is Ithaca, and who hath won
<U+202D>  Surname of City-razer, bord it out.
<U+202D>     At this, he brayd so loud, that round about
<U+202D>  He drave affrighted echoes through the air,
<U+202D>  And said:  O beast!  I was premonishd fair,
<U+202D>  By aged prophecy, in one that was
<U+202D>  A great and good man, this should come to pass;
<U+202D>  And how tis provd now!  Augur Telemus,
<U+202D>  Surnamd Eurymides (that spent with us
<U+202D>  His age in augury, and did exceed
<U+202D>  In all presage of truth) said all this deed
<U+202D>  Should this event take, authord by the hand
<U+202D>  Of one Ulysses, who I thought was mannd
<U+202D>  With great and goodly personage, and bore
<U+202D>  A virtue answerable; and this shore
<U+202D>  Should shake with weight of such a conqueror;
<U+202D>  When now a weakling came, a dwarfy thing,
<U+202D>  A thing of nothing; who yet wit did bring,
<U+202D>  That brought supply to all, and with his wine
<U+202D>  Put out the flame where all my light did shine.
<U+202D>  Come, land again, Ulysses!  that my hand
<U+202D>  May guest-rites give thee, and the great command,
<U+202D>  That Neptune hath at sea, I may convert
<U+202D>  To the deduction where abides thy heart,
<U+202D>  With my solicitings, whose son I am,
<U+202D>  And whose fame boasts to bear my fathers name.
<U+202D>  Nor think my hurt offends me, for my sire
<U+202D>  Can soon repose in it the visual fire,
<U+202D>  At his free pleasure; which no powr beside
<U+202D>  Can boast, of men, or of the Deified.
<U+202D>     I answerd:  Would to God!  I could compell
<U+202D>  Both life and soul from thee, and send to hell
<U+202D>  Those spoils of nature!  Hardly Neptune then
<U+202D>  Could cure thy hurt, and give thee all again.
<U+202D>     Then flew fierce vows to Neptune, both his hands
<U+202D>  To star-born heavn cast: O thou that all lands
<U+202D>  Girdst in thy ambient circle, and in air
<U+202D>  Shakst the curld tresses of thy sapphire hair,
<U+202D>  If I be thine, or thou mayst justly vaunt
<U+202D>  Thou art my father, hear me now, and grant
<U+202D>  That this Ulysses, old Laertes son,
<U+202D>  That dwells in Ithaca, and name hath won
<U+202D>  Of City-ruiner, may never reach
<U+202D>  His natural region.  Or if to fetch
<U+202D>  That, and the sight of his fair roofs and friends,
<U+202D>  Be fatal to him, let him that amends
<U+202D>  For all his miseries, long time and ill,
<U+202D>  Smart for, and fail of; nor that fate fulfill,
<U+202D>  Till all his soldiers quite are cast away
<U+202D>  In others ships.  And when, at last, the day
<U+202D>  Of his sole-landing shall his dwelling show,
<U+202D>  Let Detriment prepare him wrongs enow.
<U+202D>     Thus prayd he Neptune; who, his sire, appeard,
<U+202D>  And all his prayr to evry syllable heard.
<U+202D>  But then a rock, in size more amplified
<U+202D>  Than first, he ravishd to him, and implied
<U+202D>  A dismal strength in it, when, wheeld about,
<U+202D>  He sent it after us; nor flew it out
<U+202D>  From any blind aim, for a little pass
<U+202D>  Beyond our fore-deck from the fall there was,
<U+202D>  With which the sea our ship gave back upon,
<U+202D>  And shrunk up into billows from the stone,
<U+202D>  Our ship again repelling near as near
<U+202D>  The shore as first.  But then our rowers were,
<U+202D>  Being warnd, more armd, and stronglier stemmd the flood
<U+202D>  That bore back on us, till our ship made good
<U+202D>  The other island, where our whole fleet lay,
<U+202D>  In which our friends lay mourning for our stay,
<U+202D>  And evry minute lookd when we should land.
<U+202D>  Where, now arrivd, we drew up to the sand,
<U+202D>  The Cyclops sheep dividing, that none there
<U+202D>  Of all our privates might be wrung, and bear
<U+202D>  Too much on powr.  The ram yet was alone
<U+202D>  By all my friends made all my portion
<U+202D>  Above all others; and I made him then
<U+202D>  A sacrifice for me and all my men  [10]
<U+202D>  To cloud-compelling Jove that all commands,
<U+202D>  To whom I burnd the thighs; but my sad hands
<U+202D>  Receivd no grace from him, who studied how
<U+202D>  To offer men and fleet to overthrow.
