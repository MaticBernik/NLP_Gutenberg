_Launce._ Marry, thus; when it stands well with him, it
stands well with her.                                               20
_Speed._ What an ass art thou! I understand thee not.
_Launce._ What a block art thou, that thou canst not!
My staff understands me.
_Speed._ What thou sayest?
_Launce._ Ay, and what I do too: look thee, I'll but                25
lean, and my staff understands me.
_Speed._ It stands under thee, indeed.
_Launce._ Why, stand-under and under-stand is all one.
_Speed._ But tell me true, will't be a match?
_Launce._ Ask my dog: if he say ay, it will; if he say,             30
no, it will; if he shake his tail and say nothing, it will.
_Speed._ The conclusion is, then, that it will.
_Launce._ Thou shalt never get such a secret from me
but by a parable.
_Speed._ 'Tis well that I get it so. But, Launce, how               35
sayest thou, that my master is become a notable lover?
_Launce._ I never knew him otherwise.
_Speed._ Than how?
_Launce._ A notable lubber, as thou reportest him to be.
_Speed._ Why, thou whoreson ass, thou mistakest me.                 40
_Launce._ Why fool, I meant not thee; I meant thy master.
_Speed._ I tell thee, my master is become a hot lover.
_Launce._ Why, I tell thee, I care not though he burn
himself in love. If thou wilt, go with me to the alehouse;
if not, thou art an Hebrew, a Jew, and not worth the name           45
of a Christian.
_Speed._ Why?
_Launce._ Because thou hast not so much charity in thee
as to go to the ale with a Christian. Wilt thou go?
_Speed._ At thy service.    [_Exeunt._                              50

SCENE VI. _The same. The DUKE'S palace._
  _Enter PROTEUS._
_Pro._ To leave my Julia, shall I be forsworn;
To love fair Silvia, shall I be forsworn;
To wrong my friend, I shall be much forsworn;
And even that power, which gave me first my oath,
Provokes me to this threefold perjury;                               5
Love bade me swear, and Love bids me forswear.
O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinn'd,
Teach me, thy tempted subject, to excuse it!
At first I did adore a twinkling star,
But now I worship a celestial sun.                                  10
Unheedful vows may needfully be broken;
And he wants wit that wants resolved will
To learn his wit to exchange the bad for better.
Fie, fie, unreverend tongue! to call her bad,
Whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferr'd                        15
With twenty thousand soul-confirming oaths.
I cannot leave to love, and yet I do;
But there I leave to love where I should love.
Julia I lose, and Valentine I lose:
If I keep them, I needs must lose myself;                           20
If I lose them, thus find I by their loss
For Valentine, myself, for Julia, Silvia.
I to myself am dearer than a friend,
For love is still most precious in itself;
And Silvia--witness Heaven, that made her fair!--                   25
Shows Julia but a swarthy Ethiope.
I will forget that Julia is alive,
Remembering that my love to her is dead;
And Valentine I'll hold an enemy,
Aiming at Silvia as a sweeter friend.                               30
I cannot now prove constant to myself,
Without some treachery used to Valentine.
This night he meaneth with a corded ladder
To climb celestial Silvia's chamber-window;
Myself in counsel, his competitor.                                  35
Now presently I'll give her father notice
Of their disguising and pretended flight;
Who, all enraged, will banish Valentine;
For Thurio, he intends, shall wed his daughter;
But, Valentine being gone, I'll quickly cross                       40
By some sly trick blunt Thurio's dull proceeding.
Love, lend me wings to make my purpose swift,
As thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift!    [_Exit._
