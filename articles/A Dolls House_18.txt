_Nora_. Are you out of your senses? How can you think of such a thing! A
friend of ours, who comes here every day! Do you realise what a horribly
painful position that would be?
_Mrs. Linde_. Then it really isn't he?
_Nora_. No, certainly not. It would never have entered into my head for
a moment. Besides, he had no money to lend then; he came into his money
afterwards.
_Mrs. Linde_. Well, I think that was lucky for you, my dear Nora.
_Nora_. No, it would never have come into my head to ask Doctor Rank.
Although I am quite sure that if I had asked him--
_Mrs. Linde_. But of course you won't.
_Nora_. Of course not. I have no reason to think it could possibly be
necessary. But I am quite sure that if I told Doctor Rank--
_Mrs. Linde_. Behind your husband's back?
_Nora_. I must make an end of it with the other one, and that will be
behind his back too. I _must_ make an end of it with him.
_Mrs. Linde_. Yes, that is what I told you yesterday, but--
_Nora_ (_walking up and down_). A man can put a thing like that straight
much easier than a woman--
_Mrs. Linde_. One's husband, yes.
_Nora_. Nonsense! (_Standing still_.) When you pay off a debt you get
your bond back, don't you?
_Mrs. Linde_. Yes, as a matter of course.
_Nora_. And can tear it into a hundred thousand pieces, and burn it
up--the nasty, dirty paper!
_Mrs. Linde_ (_looks hard at her, lays down her sewing and gets up
slowly_). Nora, you are concealing something from me.
_Nora_. Do I look as if I were?
_Mrs. Linde_. Something has happened to you since yesterday morning.
Nora, what is it?
_Nora_ (_going nearer to her_). Christine! (_Listens_.) Hush! there's
Torvald come home. Do you mind going in to the children for the present?
Torvald can't bear to see dressmaking going on. Let Anne help you.
_Mrs. Linde_ (_gathering some of the things together_). Certainly--but I
am not going away from here till we have had it out with one another.
(_She goes into the room, on the left, as Helmer comes in from, the
hall_.)
_Nora_ (_going up to_ HELMAR). I have wanted you so much, Torvald dear.
_Helmer_. Was that the dressmaker?
_Nora_. No, it was Christine; she is helping me to put my dress in
order. You will see I shall look quite smart.
_Helmer_. Wasn't that a happy thought of mine, now?
_Nora_. Splendid! But don't you think it is nice of me, too, to do as
you wish?
_Helmer_. Nice?--because you do as your husband wishes? Well, well, you
little rogue, I am sure you did not mean it in that way. But I am not
going to disturb you; you will want to be trying on your dress, I
expect.
_Nora_. I suppose you are going to work.
_Helmer_. Yes. (_Shows her a bundle of papers_.) Look at that. I have
just been into the bank. (_Turns to go into his room_.)
