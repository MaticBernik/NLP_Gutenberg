_Caius._ By my trot, I tarry too long. --Od's me!                   55
Qu'ai-j'oublie! dere is some simples in my closet, dat I
vill not for the varld I shall leave behind.
_Quick._ Ay me, he'll find the young man there, and be
mad!
_Caius._ O diable, diable! vat is in my closet? Villain!            60
larron! [_Pulling Simple out._] Rugby, my rapier!
_Quick._ Good master, be content.
_Caius._ Wherefore shall I be content-a?
_Quick._ The young man is an honest man.
_Caius._ What shall de honest man do in my closet?                  65
dere is no honest man dat shall come in my closet.
_Quick._ I beseech you, be not so phlegmatic. Hear the
truth of it: he came of an errand to me from Parson Hugh.
_Caius._ Vell.
_Sim._ Ay, forsooth; to desire her to--                             70
_Quick._ Peace, I pray you.
_Caius._ Peace-a your tongue. Speak-a your tale.
_Sim._ To desire this honest gentlewoman, your maid,
to speak a good word to Mistress Anne Page for my
master in the way of marriage.                                      75
_Quick._ This is all, indeed, la! but I'll ne'er put my
finger in the fire, and need not.
_Caius._ Sir Hugh send-a you? Rugby, baille me some
paper. Tarry you a little-a while.    [_Writes._
_Quick._ [_Aside to Simple_] I am glad he is so quiet:              80
if he had been throughly moved, you should have heard
him so loud and so melancholy. But notwithstanding,
man, I'll do you your master what good I can: and the
very yea and the no is, the French doctor, my master,--I
may call him my master, look you, for I keep his house;             85
and I wash, wring, brew, bake, scour, dress meat and drink,
make the beds, and do all myself,--
_Sim._ [_Aside to Quickly_] 'Tis a great charge to come
under one body's hand.
_Quick._ [_Aside to Simple_] Are you avised o' that? you            90
shall find it a great charge: and to be up early and down
late;--but notwithstanding,--to tell you in your ear; I
would have no words of it,--my master himself is in love
with Mistress Anne Page: but notwithstanding that, I know
Anne's mind,--that's neither here nor there.                        95
_Caius._ You jack'nape, give-a this letter to Sir Hugh;
by gar, it is a shallenge: I will cut his troat in de park;
and I will teach a scurvy jack-a-nape priest to meddle or
make. You may be gone; it is not good you tarry here. --By
gar, I will cut all his two stones; by gar, he shall not           100
have a stone to throw at his dog.    [_Exit Simple._
_Quick._ Alas, he speaks but for his friend.
_Caius._ It is no matter-a ver dat:--do not you tell-a
me dat I shall have Anne Page for myself?--By gar, I vill
kill de Jack priest; and I have appointed mine host of de          105
Jarteer to measure our weapon:--By gar, I will myself
have Anne Page.
_Quick._ Sir, the maid loves you, and all shall be well.
We must give folks leave to prate: what, the good-jer!
