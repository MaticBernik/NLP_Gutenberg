"the TOWN which has four million inhabitants."
    [Note that we here use the article "the" instead of "a", because
    we happen to know that there is only _one_ such Thing.
    The Reader can set himself any number of Examples of this
    Process, by simply choosing the Name of any common Thing (such
    as "house," "tree," "knife"), making a Definition for it, and
    then testing his answer by referring to any English Dictionary.]
                                                                   pg008
BOOK II.
PROPOSITIONS.
CHAPTER I.
_PROPOSITIONS GENERALLY._
Sec. 1.
_Introductory._
Note that the word "some" is to be regarded, henceforward, as meaning
"one or more."
The word 'Proposition,' as used in ordinary conversation, may be applied
to _any_ word, or phrase, which conveys any information whatever.
    [Thus the words "yes" and "no" are Propositions in the ordinary
    sense of the word; and so are the phrases "you owe me five
    farthings" and "I don't!"
    Such words as "oh!" or "never!", and such phrases as "fetch me
    that book!" "which book do you mean?" do not seem, at first
    sight, to convey any _information_; but they can easily be
    turned into equivalent forms which do so, viz. "I am surprised,"
    "I will never consent to it," "I order you to fetch me that
    book," "I want to know which book you mean."]
But a '=Proposition=,' as used in this First Part of "Symbolic Logic,"
has a peculiar form, which may be called its '=Normal form='; and if any
Proposition, which we wish to use in an argument, is not in normal form,
we must reduce it to such a form, before we can use it.
                                                                   pg009
A '=Proposition=,' when in normal form, asserts, as to certain two
Classes, which are called its '=Subject=' and '=Predicate=,' either
    (1) that _some_ Members of its Subject are Members
    of its Predicate;
    or (2) that _no_ Members of its Subject are Members
    of its Predicate;
    or (3) that _all_ Members of its Subject are Members
    of its Predicate.
The Subject and the Predicate of a Proposition are called its '=Terms=.'
Two Propositions, which convey the _same_ information, are said to be
'=equivalent='.
    [Thus, the two Propositions, "I see John" and "John is seen by
    me," are equivalent.]
Sec. 2.
_Normal form of a Proposition._
A Proposition, in normal form, consists of four parts, viz.--
    (1) The word "some," or "no," or "all." (This word,
    which tells us _how many_ Members of the Subject
    are also Members of the Predicate, is called the
    '=Sign of Quantity=.')
    (2) Name of Subject.
    (3) The verb "are" (or "is"). (This is called the
    '=Copula=.')
    (4) Name of Predicate.
                                                                   pg010
Sec. 3.
_Various kinds of Propositions._
A Proposition, that begins with "Some", is said to be '=Particular=.' It
is also called 'a Proposition =in I=.'
    [Note, that it is called 'Particular,' because it refers to a
    _part_ only of the Subject.]
A Proposition, that begins with "No", is said to be '=Universal
Negative=.' It is also called 'a Proposition =in E=.'
A Proposition, that begins with "All", is said to be '=Universal
Affirmative=.' It is also called 'a Proposition =in A=.'
