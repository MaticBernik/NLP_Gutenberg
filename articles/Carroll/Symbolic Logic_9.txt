    [Note, that they are called 'Universal', because they refer to
    the _whole_ of the Subject.]
A Proposition, whose Subject is an _Individual_, is to be regarded as
_Universal_.
    [Let us take, as an example, the Proposition "John is not well".
    This of course implies that there is an _Individual_, to whom
    the speaker refers when he mentions "John", and whom the
    listener _knows_ to be referred to. Hence the Class "men
    referred to by the speaker when he mentions 'John'" is a
    one-Member Class, and the Proposition is equivalent to "_All_
    the men, who are referred to by the speaker when he mentions
    'John', are not well."]
Propositions are of two kinds, 'Propositions of Existence' and
'Propositions of Relation.'
These shall be discussed separately.
                                                                   pg011
CHAPTER II.
_PROPOSITIONS OF EXISTENCE._
A '=Proposition of Existence=', when in normal form, has, for its
_Subject_, the Class "existing Things".
Its Sign of Quantity is "Some" or "No".
    [Note that, though its Sign of Quantity tells us _how many_
    existing Things are Members of its Predicate, it does _not_ tell
    us the _exact_ number: in fact, it only deals with _two_
    numbers, which are, in ascending order, "0" and "1 or more."]
It is called "a Proposition of Existence" because its effect is to
assert the _Reality_ (i.e. the real _existence_), or else the
_Imaginariness_, of its Predicate.
    [Thus, the Proposition "Some existing Things are honest men"
    asserts that the Class "honest men" is _Real_.
    This is the _normal_ form; but it may also be expressed in any
    one of the following forms:--
        (1) "Honest men exist";
        (2) "Some honest men exist";
        (3) "The Class 'honest men' exists";
        (4) "There are honest men";
        (5) "There are some honest men".
    Similarly, the Proposition "No existing Things are men fifty
    feet high" asserts that the Class "men 50 feet high" is
    _Imaginary_.
    This is the _normal_ form; but it may also be expressed in any
    one of the following forms:--
        (1) "Men 50 feet high do not exist";
        (2) "No men 50 feet high exist";
        (3) "The Class 'men 50 feet high' does not exist";
        (4) "There are not any men 50 feet high";
        (5) "There are no men 50 feet high."]
                                                                   pg012
CHAPTER III.
_PROPOSITIONS OF RELATION._
Sec. 1.
_Introductory._
A =Proposition of Relation=, of the kind to be here discussed, has, for
its Terms, two Specieses of the same Genus, such that each of the two
Names conveys the idea of some Attribute _not_ conveyed by the other.
    [Thus, the Proposition "Some merchants are misers" is of the
    right kind, since "merchants" and "misers" are Specieses of the
    same Genus "men"; and since the Name "merchants" conveys the
    idea of the Attribute "mercantile", and the name "misers" the
    idea of the Attribute "miserly", each of which ideas is _not_
    conveyed by the other Name.
    But the Proposition "Some dogs are setters" is _not_ of the
    right kind, since, although it is true that "dogs" and "setters"
    are Specieses of the same Genus "animals", it is _not_ true that
    the Name "dogs" conveys the idea of any Attribute not conveyed
    by the Name "setters". Such Propositions will be discussed in
    Part II.]
