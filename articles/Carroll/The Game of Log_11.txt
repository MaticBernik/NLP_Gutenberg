Let us not quarrel with them, dear Reader!  There is room enough in
the world for both of us.  Let us quietly take our broader system:
and, if they choose to shut their eyes to all these useful forms,
and to say "They are not Syllogisms at all!" we can but stand aside,
and let them Rush upon their Fate!  There is scarcely anything of
yours, upon which it is so dangerous to Rush, as your Fate.  You
may Rush upon your Potato-beds, or your Strawberry-beds, without
doing much harm: you may even Rush upon your Balcony (unless it
is a new house, built by contract, and with no clerk of the works)
and may survive the foolhardy enterprise: but if you once Rush upon
your FATE--why, you must take the consequences!
CHAPTER II.
CROSS QUESTIONS.
        "The Man in the Wilderness asked of me
         'How many strawberries grow in the sea?'"
                      __________
1. Elementary.
1.  What is an 'Attribute'?  Give examples.
2.  When is it good sense to put "is" or "are" between two names?
Give examples.
3.  When is it NOT good sense?  Give examples.
4.  When it is NOT good sense, what is the simplest agreement to
make, in order to make good sense?
5.  Explain 'Proposition', 'Term', 'Subject', and 'Predicate'.
Give examples.
6.  What are 'Particular' and 'Universal' Propositions?  Give
examples.
7.  Give a rule for knowing, when we look at the smaller Diagram,
what Attributes belong to the things in each compartment.
8.  What does "some" mean in Logic?  [See pp. 55, 6]
9.  In what sense do we use the word 'Universe' in this Game?
10.  What is a 'Double' Proposition?  Give examples.
11.  When is a class of Things said to be 'exhaustively' divided?
Give examples.
12.  Explain the phrase "sitting on the fence."
13.  What two partial Propositions make up, when taken together,
"all x are y"?
14.  What are 'Individual' Propositions?  Give examples.
15.  What kinds of Propositions imply, in this Game, the EXISTENCE
of their Subjects?
16.  When a Proposition contains more than two Attributes, these
Attributes may in some cases be re-arranged, and shifted from one
Term to the other.  In what cases may this be done?  Give examples.
__________
Break up each of the following into two partial
Propositions:
17.  All tigers are fierce.
18.  All hard-boiled eggs are unwholesome.
19.  I am happy.
20.  John is not at home.
__________
[See pp. 56, 7]
21.  Give a rule for knowing, when we look at the larger Diagram,
what Attributes belong to the Things contained in each compartment.
22.  Explain 'Premisses', 'Conclusion', and 'Syllogism'.  Give
examples.
23.  Explain the phrases 'Middle Term' and 'Middle Terms'.
24.  In marking a pair of Premisses on the larger Diagram, why is
it best to mark NEGATIVE Propositions before AFFIRMATIVE ones?
25.  Why is it of no consequence to us, as Logicians, whether the
Premisses are true or false?
26.  How can we work Syllogisms in which we are told that "some x
are y" is to be understood to mean "the Attribute x, y are COMPATIBLE",
and "no x are y" to mean "the Attributes x, y are INCOMPATIBLE"?
