To while away the time, I strolled, one afternoon, into Kensington
Gardens, and, wandering aimlessly along any path that presented itself,
I soon became aware that I had somehow strayed into one that was wholly
new to me. Still, my elfish experiences seemed to have so completely
faded out of my life that nothing was further from my thoughts than the
idea of again meeting my fairy-friends, when I chanced to notice a small
creature, moving among the grass that fringed the path, that did not
seem to be an insect, or a frog, or any other living thing that I could
think of. Cautiously kneeling down, and making an _ex tempore_ cage of
my two hands, I imprisoned the little wanderer, and felt a sudden thrill
of surprise and delight on discovering that my prisoner was no other
than _Bruno_ himself!
Bruno took the matter _very_ coolly, and, when I had replaced him on the
ground, where he would be within easy conversational distance, he began
talking, just as if it were only a few minutes since last we had met.
Doos oo know what the _Rule_ is, he enquired, when oo catches a
Fairy, withouten its having tolded oo where it was? (Brunos notions of
English Grammar had certainly _not_ improved since our last meeting.)
No, I said. I didnt know there was any Rule about it.
I _think_ oove got a right to _eat_ me, said the little fellow,
looking up into my face with a winning smile. But Im not pruffickly
sure. Ood better not do it wizout asking.
It did indeed seem reasonable not to take so irrevocable a step as
_that_, without due enquiry. Ill certainly _ask_ about it, first, I
said. Besides, I dont know yet whether you would be _worth_ eating!
I guess Im _deliciously_ good to eat, Bruno remarked in a satisfied
tone, as if it were something to be rather proud of.
And what are you doing here, Bruno?
_Thats_ not my name! said my cunning little friend. Dont oo know my
names Oh Bruno!? Thats what Sylvie always calls me, when I says mine
lessons.
Well then, what are you doing here, oh Bruno?
Doing mine lessons, a-course! With that roguish twinkle in his eye,
that always came when he knew he was talking nonsense.
Oh, _thats_ the way you do your lessons, is it? And do you remember
them well?
Always can member _mine_ lessons, said Bruno. Its _Sylvies_
lessons thats so _dreffully_ hard to member! He frowned, as if in
agonies of thought, and tapped his forehead with his knuckles. I
_cant_ think enough to understand them! he said despairingly. It
wants _double_ thinking, I believe!
But wheres Sylvie gone?
Thats just what _I_ want to know! said Bruno disconsolately. What
evers the good of setting me lessons, when she isnt here to splain
the hard bits?
_Ill_ find her for you! I volunteered; and, getting up, I wandered
round the tree under whose shade I had been reclining, looking on all
sides for Sylvie. In another minute I _again_ noticed some strange thing
moving among the grass, and, kneeling down, was immediately confronted
with Sylvies innocent face, lighted up with a joyful surprise at seeing
me, and was accosted, in the sweet voice I knew so well, with what
seemed to be the _end_ of a sentence whose beginning I had failed to
catch.
