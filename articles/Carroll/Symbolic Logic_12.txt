        "Some | farmers | are | persons who always
        grumble at the weather, whatever it may be."
    (9)
    "No lambs are accustomed to smoke cigars."
    (1) The Subject is "lambs."
    (2) The Verb is "are."
    (3) The Predicate is "* * * accustomed &c."
    (4) Let Univ. be "animals."
    (5) The Sign of Quantity is "no."
    (6) The Proposition now becomes
        "No | lambs | are | animals accustomed to smoke
        cigars."
    (10)
    "I ca'n't understand examples that are not arranged in regular
    order, like those I am used to."
    (1) The Subject is "examples that," &c.
    (2) The Verb is "I ca'n't understand," which we must alter, so
    as to have "examples," instead of "I," as the nominative case.
    It may be expressed as "are not understood by me."
    (3) The Predicate is "* * * not understood by me."
    (4) Let Univ. be "examples."
    (5) The Sign of Quantity is "all."
    (6) The Proposition now becomes
        "All | examples that are not arranged in regular
        order like those I am used to | are | examples not
        understood by me."]
                                                                   pg017
Sec. 3.
_A Proposition of Relation, beginning with "All", is a Double
Proposition._
A Proposition of Relation, beginning with "All", asserts (as we already
know) that "_All_ Members of the Subject are Members of the Predicate".
This evidently contains, as a _part_ of what it tells us, the smaller
Proposition "_Some_ Members of the Subject are Members of the
Predicate".
    [Thus, the Proposition "_All_ bankers are rich men" evidently
    contains the smaller Proposition "_Some_ bankers are rich men".]
The question now arises "What is the _rest_ of the information which
this Proposition gives us?"
In order to answer this question, let us begin with the smaller
Proposition, "_Some_ Members of the Subject are Members of the
Predicate," and suppose that this is _all_ we have been told; and let us
proceed to inquire what _else_ we need to be told, in order to know that
"_All_ Members of the Subject are Members of the Predicate".
    [Thus, we may suppose that the Proposition "_Some_ bankers are
    rich men" is all the information we possess; and we may proceed
    to inquire what _other_ Proposition needs to be added to it, in
    order to make up the entire Proposition "_All_ bankers are rich
    men".]
Let us also suppose that the 'Univ.' (i.e. the Genus, of which both the
Subject and the Predicate are Specieses) has been divided (by the
Process of _Dichotomy_) into two smaller Classes, viz.
    (1) the Predicate;
    (2) the Class whose Differentia is _contradictory_ to that of
    the Predicate.
    [Thus, we may suppose that the Genus "men," (of which both
    "bankers" and "rich men" are Specieses) has been divided into
    the two smaller Classes, "rich men", "poor men".]
                                                                   pg018
Now we know that _every_ Member of the Subject is (as shown at p. 6) a
Member of the Univ. Hence _every_ Member of the Subject is either in
Class (1) or else in Class (2).
    [Thus, we know that _every_ banker is a Member of the Genus
    "men". Hence, _every_ banker is either in the Class "rich men",
    or else in the Class "poor men".]
