And how should there be _more_, you foolish fellow, I fondly urged,
if you never even go near her? Do you expect the offer to come from
_her_?
Arthur was betrayed into a smile. No, he said, I hardly expect
_that_. But Im a desperate coward. Theres no doubt about it!
And what _reasons_ have you heard of for breaking off the engagement?
A good many, Arthur replied, and proceeded to count them on his
fingers. First, it was found that she was dying ofsomething; so _he_
broke it off. Then it was found that _he_ was dying ofsome other thing;
so _she_ broke it off. Then the Major turned out to be a confirmed
gamester; so the _Earl_ broke it off. Then the Earl insulted him; so the
_Major_ broke it off. It got a good deal broken off, all things
considered!
You have all this on the very best authority, of course?
Oh, certainly! And communicated in the strictest confidence! Whatever
defects Elveston society suffers from, _want of information_ isnt one
of them!
Nor _reticence_, either, it seems. But, seriously, do you know the real
reason?
No, Im quite in the dark.
I did not feel that I had any right to enlighten him; so I changed the
subject, to the less engrossing one of new milk, and we agreed that I
should walk over, next day, to Hunters farm, Arthur undertaking to set
me part of the way, after which he had to return to keep a
business-engagement.
                              CHAPTER III.
                            STREAKS OF DAWN.
Next day proved warm and sunny, and we started early, to enjoy the
luxury of a good long chat before he would be obliged to leave me.
This neighbourhood has more than its due proportion of the _very_
poor, I remarked, as we passed a group of hovels, too dilapidated to
deserve the name of cottages.
But the few rich, Arthur replied, give more than their due proportion
of help in charity. So the balance is kept.
I suppose the _Earl_ does a good deal?
He _gives_ liberally; but he has not the health or strength to do more.
Lady Muriel does more in the way of school-teaching and cottage-visiting
than she would like me to reveal.
Then _she_, at least, is not one of the idle mouths one so often
meets with among the upper classes. I have sometimes thought they would
have a hard time of it, if suddenly called on to give their _raison
detre_, and to show cause why they should be allowed to live any
longer!
The whole subject, said Arthur, of what we may call idle mouths (I
mean persons who absorb some of the material _wealth_ of a communityin
the form of food, clothes, and so onwithout contributing its equivalent
in the form of productive _labour_) is a complicated one, no doubt. Ive
tried to think it out. And it seemed to me that the simplest form of the
problem, to start with, is a community without _money_, who buy and sell
by _barter_ only; and it makes it yet simpler to suppose the food and
other things to be capable of _keeping_ for many years without
spoiling.
