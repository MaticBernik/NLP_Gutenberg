  King Fisher courted Lady Bird
  _Sing Beans, sing Bones, sing Butterflies!_
    Find me my match, he said,
    With such a noble head
  With such a beard, as white as curd
    With such expressive eyes!
  Yet pins have heads, said Lady Bird
  _Sing Prunes, sing Prawns, sing Primrose-Hill!_
    And, where you stick them in,
    They stay, and thus a pin
  Is very much to be preferred
    To one thats never still!
  Oysters have beards, said Lady Bird
  _Sing Flies, sing Frogs, sing Fiddle-strings!_
    I love them, for I know
    _They_ never chatter so:
  They would not say one single word
    Not if you crowned them Kings!
  Needles have eyes, said Lady Bird
  _Sing Cats, sing Corks, sing Cowslip-tea!_
      And they are sharpjust what
      Your Majesty is _not:_
  So get you gonetis too absurd
      To come a-courting _me_!

So he went away, Bruno added as a kind of postscript, when the last
note of the song had died away. Just like he always did.
Oh, my _dear_ Bruno! Sylvie exclaimed, with her hands over her ears.
You shouldnt say like: you should say _what_.
To which Bruno replied, doggedly, I only says what! when oo doosnt
speak loud, so as I can hear oo.
Where did he go to? I asked, hoping to prevent an argument.
He went more far than hed never been before, said Bruno.
You should never say more far, Sylvie corrected him: you should say
_farther_.
Then _oo_ shouldnt say more broth, when were at dinner, Bruno
retorted: oo should say _brother_!
This time Sylvie evaded an argument by turning away, and beginning to
roll up the Map. Lessons are over! she proclaimed in her sweetest
tones.
And has there been no _crying_ over them? I enquired. Little boys
_always_ cry over their lessons, dont they?
I never cries after twelve oclock, said Bruno: cause then its
getting so near to dinner-time.
Sometimes, in the morning, Sylvie said in a low voice; when its
Geography-day, and when hes been disobe
_What_ a fellow you are to talk, Sylvie! Bruno hastily interposed.
Doos oo think the world was _made_ for oo to talk in?
Why, where would you _have_ me talk, then? Sylvie said, evidently
quite ready for an argument.
But Bruno answered resolutely. Im not going to argue about it, cause
its getting late, and there wont be timebut oos as ong as ever oo
can be! And he rubbed the back of his hand across his eyes, in which
tears were beginning to glitter.
_Sylvies_ eyes filled with tears in a moment. I didnt mean it, Bruno,
_darling_! she whispered; and the rest of the argument was lost amid
the tangles of Nearas hair, while the two disputants hugged and kissed
each other.
But this new form of argument was brought to a sudden end by a flash of
lightning, which was closely followed by a peal of thunder, and by a
torrent of rain-drops, which came hissing and spitting, almost like live
creatures, through the leaves of the tree that sheltered us.
