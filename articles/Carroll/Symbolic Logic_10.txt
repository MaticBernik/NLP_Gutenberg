The Genus, of which the two Terms are Specieses, is called the
'=Universe of Discourse=,' or (more briefly) the '=Univ.='
The Sign of Quantity is "Some" or "No" or "All".
    [Note that, though its Sign of Quantity tells us _how many_
    Members of its Subject are _also_ Members of its Predicate, it
    does not tell us the _exact_ number: in fact, it only deals with
    _three_ numbers, which are, in ascending order, "0", "1 or
    more", "the total number of Members of the Subject".]
It is called "a Proposition of Relation" because its effect is to assert
that a certain _relationship_ exists between its Terms.
                                                                   pg013
Sec. 2.
_Reduction of a Proposition of Relation to Normal form._
The Rules, for doing this, are as follows:--
(1) Ascertain what is the _Subject_ (i.e., ascertain what Class we are
_talking about_);
(2) If the verb, governed by the Subject, is _not_ the verb "are" (or
"is"), substitute for it a phrase beginning with "are" (or "is");
(3) Ascertain what is the _Predicate_ (i.e., ascertain what Class it is,
which is asserted to contain _some_, or _none_, or _all_, of the Members
of the Subject);
(4) If the Name of each Term is _completely expressed_ (i.e. if it
contains a Substantive), there is no need to determine the 'Univ.'; but,
if either Name is _incompletely expressed_, and contains _Attributes_
only, it is then necessary to determine a 'Univ.', in order to insert
its Name as the Substantive.
(5) Ascertain the _Sign of Quantity_;
(6) Arrange in the following order:--
    Sign of Quantity,
    Subject,
    Copula,
    Predicate.
    [Let us work a few Examples, to illustrate these Rules.
    (1)
    "Some apples are not ripe."
    (1) The Subject is "apples."
    (2) The Verb is "are."
    (3) The Predicate is "not-ripe * * *." (As no Substantive is
    expressed, and we have not yet settled what the Univ. is to be,
    we are forced to leave a blank.)
    (4) Let Univ. be "fruit."
    (5) The Sign of Quantity is "some."
    (6) The Proposition now becomes
        "Some | apples | are | not-ripe fruit."
                                                                   pg014
    (2)
    "None of my speculations have brought me as much as 5 per cent."
    (1) The Subject is "my speculations."
    (2) The Verb is "have brought," for which we substitute the
    phrase "are * * * that have brought".
    (3) The Predicate is "* * * that have brought &c."
    (4) Let Univ. be "transactions."
    (5) The Sign of Quantity is "none of."
    (6) The Proposition now becomes
        "None of | my speculations | are | transactions
        that have brought me as much as 5 per cent."
    (3)
    "None but the brave deserve the fair."
    To begin with, we note that the phrase "none but the brave" is
    equivalent to "no _not_-brave."
    (1) The Subject has for its _Attribute_ "not-brave." But no
    _Substantive_ is supplied. So we express the Subject as
    "not-brave * * *."
    (2) The Verb is "deserve," for which we substitute the phrase
    "are deserving of".
    (3) The Predicate is "* * * deserving of the fair."
