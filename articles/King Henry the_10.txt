    [_EXETER goes to door U.E.L.H, and calls on the Guard._
  And Heaven acquit them of their practises!
_Exe._ (_comes down, R.C._) I arrest thee of high treason, by the name
of Richard earl of Cambridge.
I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of Henry lord Scroop of
Masham.
I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of Thomas Grey, knight, of
Northumberland.
  _Scroop._ (_R., kneeling._)
  Our purposes Heaven justly hath discover'd;
  And I repent my fault more than my death.
  _Cam._ (_R., kneeling._)
  For me,--the gold of France did not seduce;(B)
  Although I did admit it as a motive
  The sooner to effect what I intended:
  But Heaven be thanked for prevention;
  Which I in sufferance heartily will rejoice,[11]
  Beseeching Heaven and you to pardon me.
  _Grey._ (_R. kneeling._) Never did faithful subject more rejoice
  At the discovery of most dangerous treason
  Than I do at this hour joy o'er myself,
  Prevented from a damned enterprize:
  My fault, but not my body, pardon, sovereign.
  _K. Hen._ (C.) Heaven quit you in its mercy! Hear your sentence.
  You have conspir'd against our royal person,
  Join'd with an enemy proclaim'd, and from his coffers
  Receiv'd the golden earnest of our death;
  Wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter,
  His princes and his peers to servitude,
  His subjects to oppression and contempt,
  And his whole kingdom into desolation.
  Touching our person, seek we no revenge;(C)
  But we our kingdom's safety must so tender,[12]
  Whose ruin you three sought, that to her laws
  We do deliver you. Get you, therefore, hence,
  Poor miserable wretches, to your death:
  The taste whereof, Heaven of its mercy give you
  Patience to endure, and true repentance
  Of all your dear offences![13]--Bear them hence.
    [_Conspirators rise and exeunt guarded, with EXETER._
  Now, Lords, for France; the enterprize whereof
  Shall be to you, as us, like glorious.
  We doubt not of a fair and lucky war,
  Since Heaven so graciously hath brought to light
  This dangerous treason, lurking in our way.
  Then, forth, dear countrymen: let us deliver
  Our puissance[14] into the hand of Heaven,
  Putting it straight in expedition.
  Cheerly to sea; the signs of war advance:(D)
  No king of England, if not king of France.
