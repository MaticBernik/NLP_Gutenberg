LADY WINDERMERE.  Oh, I cant believe it!
DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  But its quite true, my dear.  The whole of London
knows it.  That is why I felt it was better to come and talk to you, and
advise you to take Windermere away at once to Homburg or to Aix, where
hell have something to amuse him, and where you can watch him all day
long.  I assure you, my dear, that on several occasions after I was first
married, I had to pretend to be very ill, and was obliged to drink the
most unpleasant mineral waters, merely to get Berwick out of town.  He
was so extremely susceptible.  Though I am bound to say he never gave
away any large sums of money to anybody.  He is far too high-principled
for that!
LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Interrupting_.]  Duchess, Duchess, its impossible!
[_Rising and crossing stage to C._]  We are only married two years.  Our
child is but six months old.  [_Sits in chair R. of L. table_.]
DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Ah, the dear pretty baby!  How is the little
darling?  Is it a boy or a girl?  I hope a girlAh, no, I remember its a
boy!  Im so sorry.  Boys are so wicked.  My boy is excessively immoral.
You wouldnt believe at what hours he comes home.  And hes only left
Oxford a few monthsI really dont know what they teach them there.
LADY WINDERMERE.  Are _all_ men bad?
DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Oh, all of them, my dear, all of them, without any
exception.  And they never grow any better.  Men become old, but they
never become good.
LADY WINDERMERE.  Windermere and I married for love.
DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Yes, we begin like that.  It was only Berwicks
brutal and incessant threats of suicide that made me accept him at all,
and before the year was out, he was running after all kinds of
petticoats, every colour, every shape, every material.  In fact, before
the honeymoon was over, I caught him winking at my maid, a most pretty,
respectable girl.  I dismissed her at once without a character.No, I
remember I passed her on to my sister; poor dear Sir George is so
short-sighted, I thought it wouldnt matter.  But it did, thoughit was
most unfortunate.  [_Rises_.]  And now, my dear child, I must go, as we
are dining out.  And mind you dont take this little aberration of
Windermeres too much to heart.  Just take him abroad, and hell come
back to you all right.
LADY WINDERMERE.  Come back to me?  [_C._]
DUCHESS OF BERWICK.   [_L.C._]  Yes, dear, these wicked women get our
husbands away from us, but they always come back, slightly damaged, of
course.  And dont make scenes, men hate them!
LADY WINDERMERE.  It is very kind of you, Duchess, to come and tell me
all this.  But I cant believe that my husband is untrue to me.
DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Pretty child!  I was like that once.  Now I know
that all men are monsters.  [LADY WINDERMERE _rings bell_.]  The only
thing to do is to feed the wretches well.  A good cook does wonders, and
that I know you have.  My dear Margaret, you are not going to cry?
