_Fal._ Have you received no promise of satisfaction at             190
her hands?
_Ford._ Never.
_Fal._ Have you importuned her to such a purpose?
_Ford._ Never.
_Fal._ Of what quality was your love, then?                        195
_Ford._ Like a fair house built on another man's ground;
so that I have lost my edifice by mistaking the place where
I erected it.
_Fal._ To what purpose have you unfolded this to me?
_Ford._ When I have told you that, I have told you all.            200
Some say, that though she appear honest to me, yet in
other places she enlargeth her mirth so far that there is
shrewd construction made of her. Now, Sir John, here is
the heart of my purpose: you are a gentleman of excellent
breeding, admirable discourse, of great admittance, authentic      205
in your place and person, generally allowed for your
many war-like, court-like, and learned preparations.
_Fal._ O, sir!
_Ford._ Believe it, for you know it. There is money;
spend it, spend it; spend more; spend all I have; only             210
give me so much of your time in exchange of it, as to lay
an amiable siege to the honesty of this Ford's wife: use
your art of wooing; win her to consent to you: if any man
may, you may as soon as any.
_Fal._ Would it apply well to the vehemency of your                215
affection, that I should win what you would enjoy? Methinks
you prescribe to yourself very preposterously.
_Ford._ O, understand my drift. She dwells so securely
on the excellency of her honour, that the folly of my soul
dares not present itself: she is too bright to be looked           220
against. Now, could I come to her with any detection in
my hand, my desires had instance and argument to commend
themselves: I could drive her then from the ward of
her purity, her reputation, her marriage-vow, and a thousand
other her defences, which now are too, too strongly                225
embattled against me. What say you to't, Sir John?
_Fal._ Master Brook, I will first make bold with your
money; next, give me your hand; and last, as I am a gentleman,
you shall, if you will, enjoy Ford's wife.
_Ford._ O good sir!                                                230
_Fal._ I say you shall.
_Ford._ Want no money, Sir John; you shall want none.
_Fal._ Want no Mistress Ford, Master Brook; you shall
want none. I shall be with her, I may tell you, by her
own appointment; even as you came in to me, her assistant,         235
or go-between, parted from me: I say I shall be with
her between ten and eleven; for at that time the jealous
rascally knave her husband will be forth. Come you to me
at night; you shall know how I speed.
_Ford._. I am blest in your acquaintance. Do you know              240
Ford, sir?
_Fal._ Hang him, poor cuckoldly knave! I know him not:
--yet I wrong him to call him poor; they say the jealous
wittolly knave hath masses of money; for the which his wife
seems to me well-favoured. I will use her as the key of the        245
cuckoldly rogue's coffer; and there's my harvest-home.
