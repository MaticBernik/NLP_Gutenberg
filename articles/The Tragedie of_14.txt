_Laer_. Most humbly doe I take my leaue, my Lord.
_Polon_. The time inuites you, goe, your seruants tend.
                                                [Sidenote: time inuests]
_Laer._ Farewell _Ophelia_, and remember well
What I haue said to you.[14]
_Ophe_. Tis in my memory lockt,
And you your selfe shall keepe the key of it,
_Laer_. Farewell.        _Exit Laer_.
_Polon_. What ist _Ophelia_ he hath said to you?
[Footnote 1: He hurries him to go, yet immediately begins to prose.]
[Footnote 2: Engrave.]
[Footnote 3: Not settled into its true shape (?) or, out of proportion
with its occasions (?)--I cannot say which.]
[Footnote 4: 'Cultivate close relations, but do not lie open to common
access.' 'Have choice intimacies, but do not be _hail, fellow! well met_
with everybody.' What follows is an expansion of the lesson.]
[Footnote 5: 'The friends thou hast--and the choice of them justified by
trial--'_equal to_: 'provided their choice be justified &c.']
[Footnote 6: 'Do not make the palm hard, and dull its touch of
discrimination, by shaking hands in welcome with every one that turns
up.']
[Footnote 7: judgment, opinion.]
[Footnote 8: _Generosus_, of good breed, a gentleman.]
[Footnote 9: _1st Q_. 'generall chiefe.']
[Footnote 10: No doubt the omission of _of a_ gives the right number of
syllables to the verse, and makes room for the interpretation which a
dash between _generous_ and _chief_ renders clearer: 'Are most select
and generous--chief in that,'--'are most choice and well-bred--chief,
indeed--at the head or top, in the matter of dress.' But without
_necessity_ or _authority_--one of the two, I would not throw away a
word; and suggest therefore that Shakspere had here the French idiom _de
son chef_ in his mind, and qualifies the noun in it with adjectives of
his own. The Academy Dictionary gives _de son propre mouvement_ as one
interpretation of the phrase. The meaning would be, 'they are of a most
choice and developed instinct in dress.' _Cheff_ or _chief_ suggests the
upper third of the heraldic shield, but I cannot persuade the suggestion
to further development. The hypercatalectic syllables _of a_, swiftly
spoken, matter little to the verse, especially as it is _dramatic_.]
[Footnote 11: Those that borrow, having to pay, lose heart for saving.
    'There's husbandry in heaven;
    Their candles are all out.'--_Macbeth_, ii. 1.]
[Footnote 12: Certainly a man cannot be true to himself without being
true to others; neither can he be true to others without being true to
himself; but if a man make himself the centre for the birth of action,
it will follow, '_as the night the day_,' that he will be true neither
to himself nor to any other man. In this regard note the history of
Laertes, developed in the play.]
[Footnote 13: --as salt, to make the counsel keep.]
[Footnote 14: See _note 9, page 37_.]

_Ophe._ So please you, somthing touching the L. _Hamlet._
_Polon._ Marry, well bethought:
Tis told me he hath very oft of late
Giuen priuate time to you; and you your selfe
Haue of your audience beene most free and bounteous.[1]
If it be so, as so tis put on me;[2]
And that in way of caution: I must tell you,
You doe not vnderstand your selfe so cleerely,
As it behoues my Daughter, and your Honour
What is betweene you, giue me vp the truth?
