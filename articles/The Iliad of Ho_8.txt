"Truly now these will be grievous matters, and no longer tolerable, if
ye twain contend thus on account of mortals, and excite uproar among the
deities. Nor will there be any enjoyment in the delightful banquet,
since the worse things prevail.[62] But to my mother I advise, she
herself being intelligent, to gratify my dear father Jove, lest my sire
may again reprove her, and disturb our banquet. For if the Olympian
Thunderer wishes to hurl [us] from our seats[63]--for he is much the
most powerful. But do thou soothe him with gentle words; then will the
Olympian king straightway be propitious to us."
   [Footnote 62: Cf. Duport, Gnom. Hom. p. 9. The saying is almost
   proverbial.]
   [Footnote 63: An aposiopesis; understand, "he can easily do so."]
Thus then he spoke, and rising, he placed the double cup[64] in the hand
of his dear mother, and addressed her:
"Be patient, my mother, and restrain thyself, although grieved, lest
with my own eyes I behold thee beaten, being very dear to me; nor then
indeed should I be able, though full of grief, to assist thee; for
Olympian Jove is difficult to be opposed. For heretofore, having seized
me by the foot, he cast me, desiring at one time to assist you, down
from the heavenly threshold. All day was I carried down through the air,
and I fell on Lemnos[65] with the setting sun: and but little life was
in me by that time. There the Sintian[66] men forthwith received and
tended[67] me, having fallen."
Thus he spoke: but the white-armed goddess Juno smiled; and smiling she
received the cup from the hand of her son. But he, beginning from left
to right,[68] kept pouring out for all the other gods, drawing nectar
from the goblet. And then inextinguishable laughter arose among the
immortal gods, when they saw Vulcan bustling about[69] through the
mansion.
   [Footnote 64: See my note on Od. iii. p. 30, n. 13, ed. Bohn. It
   was "a double cup with a common bottom in the middle."--Crusius.]
   [Footnote 65: Hercules having sacked Troy, was, on his return,
   driven to Cos by a storm raised by Juno, who was hostile to him,
   and who had contrived to cast Jupiter into a sleep, that he might
   not interrupt her purpose. Jupiter awaking, in resentment of the
   artifice practised upon him, bound her feet to iron anvils, which
   Vulcan attempting to loose, was cast headlong down to Lemnos by
   his enraged sire.]
   [Footnote 66: A race of robbers, of Tyrrhenian origin (according
   to Mueller), and the ancient inhabitants of Lemnos. This island
   was ever after sacred to Vulcan. Cf. Lactant. i. 15; Milton, P.L.
   i. 740, sqq.]
   [Footnote 67: See Arnold.]
   [Footnote 68: This meaning of [Greek: endexia] is due to Buttmann.]
   [Footnote 69: See Buttmann, Lexil. p. 481.]
Thus, then, they feasted[70] the entire day till the setting sun; nor
did the soul want anything of the equal feast, nor of the beautiful
harp, which Apollo held, nor of the Muses, who accompanied him,
responding in turn, with delicious voice.
