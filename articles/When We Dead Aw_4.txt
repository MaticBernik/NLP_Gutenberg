PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Has risen slowly and involuntarily, and stands staring at the closed
door of the pavilion.] Who was that lady?
THE INSPECTOR.
She is a stranger who has rented the little pavilion there.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
A foreigner?
THE INSPECTOR.
Presumably. At any rate they both came from abroad--about a week ago.
They have never been here before.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Decidedly; looking at him.] It was she I saw in the park last night.
THE INSPECTOR.
No doubt it must have been. I thought so from the first.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
What is this lady's name, Inspector?
THE INSPECTOR.
She has registered herself as "Madame de Satow, with companion." We know
nothing more.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Reflecting.] Satow? Satow--?
MAIA. [Laughing mockingly.] Do you know any one of that name, Rubek? Eh?
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Shaking his head.] No, no one.--Satow? It sounds Russian--or in all
events Slavonic. [To the INSPECTOR.] What language does she speak?
THE INSPECTOR.
When the two ladies talk to each other, it is in a language I cannot
make out at all. But at other times she speaks Norwegian like a native.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Exclaims with a start.] Norwegian? You are sure you are not mistaken?
THE INSPECTOR.
No, how could I be mistaken in that?
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Looks at him with eager interest.] You have heard her yourself?
THE INSPECTOR.
Yes. I myself have spoken to her--several times.--Only a few words,
however; she is far from communicative. But--
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
But Norwegian it was?
THE INSPECTOR.
Thoroughly good Norwegian--perhaps with a little north-country accent.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Gazing straight before him in amazement, whispers.] That too?
MAIA.
[A little hurt and jarred.] Perhaps this lady has been one of your
models, Rubek? Search your memory.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Looks cuttingly at her.] My models?
MAIA.
[With a provoking smile.] In your younger days, I mean. You are said to
have had innumerable models--long ago, of course.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[In the same tone.] Oh no, little Frau Maia. I have in reality had only
one single model. One and only one--for everything I have done.
THE INSPECTOR.
[Who has turned away and stands looking out to the left.] If you'll
excuse me, I think I will take my leave. I see some one coming whom it
is not particularly agreeable to meet. Especially in the presence of
ladies.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Looking in the same direction.] That sportsman there? Who is it?
THE INSPECTOR.
It is a certain Mr. Ulfheim, from--
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Oh, Mr. Ulfheim--
THE INSPECTOR. --the bear-killer, as they call him--
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
I know him.
THE INSPECTOR.
Who does not know him?
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Very slightly, however. Is he on your list of patients--at last?
THE INSPECTOR.
No, strangely enough--not as yet. He comes here only once a year--on his
way up to his hunting-grounds.--Excuse me for the moment--
    [Makes a movement to go into the hotel.
ULFHEIM's VOICE.
[Heard outside.] Stop a moment, man! Devil take it all, can't you stop?
Why do you always scuttle away from me?
