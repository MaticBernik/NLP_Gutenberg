LEONATO.
Indeed he looks younger than he did, by the loss of a beard.
DON PEDRO.
Nay, a' rubs himself with civet: can you smell him out by that?
CLAUDIO.
That's as much as to say the sweet youth's in love.
DON PEDRO.
The greatest note of it is his melancholy.
CLAUDIO.
And when was he wont to wash his face?
DON PEDRO.
Yea, or to paint himself? for the which, I hear what they say of him.
CLAUDIO.
Nay, but his jesting spirit; which is now crept into a lute-string,
and new-governed by stops.
DON PEDRO.
Indeed, that tells a heavy tale for him. Conclude, conclude he is
in love.
CLAUDIO.
Nay, but I know who loves him.
DON PEDRO.
That would I know too: I warrant, one that knows him not.
CLAUDIO.
Yes, and his ill conditions; and in despite of all, dies for him.
DON PEDRO.
She shall be buried with her face upwards.
BENEDICK.
Yet is this no charm for the tooth-ache. Old signior, walk aside with
me: I have studied eight or nine wise words to speak to you, which
these hobby-horses must not hear.
[Exeunt BENEDICK and LEONATO.]
DON PEDRO.
For my life, to break with him about Beatrice.
CLAUDIO.
'Tis even so. Hero and Margaret have by this played their parts with
Beatrice, and then the two bears will not bite one another when they
meet.
[Enter DON JOHN.]
DON JOHN.
My lord and brother, God save you!
DON PEDRO.
Good den, brother.
DON JOHN.
If your leisure served, I would speak with you.
DON PEDRO.
In private?
DON JOHN.
If it please you; yet Count Claudio may hear, for what I would
speak of concerns him.
DON PEDRO.
What's the matter?
DON JOHN.
[To CLAUDIO.] Means your lordship to be married to-morrow?
DON PEDRO.
You know he does.
DON JOHN.
I know not that, when he knows what I know.
CLAUDIO.
If there be any impediment, I pray you discover it.
DON JOHN.
You may think I love you not: let that appear hereafter, and aim
better at me by that I now will manifest. For my brother, I think
he holds you well, and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect your
ensuing marriage; surely suit ill-spent and labour ill bestowed!
DON PEDRO.
Why, what's the matter?
DON JOHN.
I came hither to tell you; and circumstances shortened,--for she
has been too long a talking of,--the lady is disloyal.
CLAUDIO.
Who, Hero?
DON JOHN.
Even she: Leonato's Hero, your Hero, every man's Hero.
CLAUDIO.
Disloyal?
DON JOHN.
The word's too good to paint out her wickedness; I could say, she were
worse: think you of a worse title, and I will fit her to it. Wonder not
till further warrant: go but with me to-night, you shall see her
chamber-window entered, even the night before her wedding-day: if you
love her then, to-morrow wed her; but it would better fit your honour
to change your mind.
CLAUDIO.
May this be so?
