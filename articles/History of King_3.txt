SUFFOLK.
Madam, myself have lim'd a bush for her,
And plac'd a quire of such enticing birds
That she will light to listen to the lays,
And never mount to trouble you again.
So, let her rest; and, madam, list to me,
For I am bold to counsel you in this.
Although we fancy not the cardinal,
Yet must we join with him and with the lords
Till we have brought Duke Humphrey in disgrace.
As for the Duke of York, this late complaint
Will make but little for his benefit.
So, one by one, we'll weed them all at last,
And you yourself shall steer the happy helm.
[Sennet. Enter the KING, DUKE HUMPHREY, CARDINAL
BEAUFORT, BUCKINGHAM, YORK, SOMERSET, SALISBURY,
WARWICK, and the DUCHESS OF GLOSTER.]
KING.
For my part, noble lords, I care not which;
Or Somerset or York, all's one to me.
YORK.
If York have ill demean'd himself in France,
Then let him be denay'd the regentship.
SOMERSET.
If Somerset be unworthy of the place,
Let York be regent; I will yield to him.
WARWICK.
Whether your grace be worthy, yea or no,
Dispute not that; York is the worthier.
CARDINAL.
Ambitious Warwick, let thy betters speak.
WARWICK.
The cardinal's not my better in the field.
BUCKINGHAM.
All in this presence are thy betters, Warwick.
WARWICK.
Warwick may live to be the best of all.
SALISBURY.
Peace, son!--and show some reason, Buckingham,
Why Somerset should be preferr'd in this.
QUEEN.
Because the king, forsooth, will have it so.
GLOSTER.
Madam, the King is old enough himself
To give his censure; these are no women's matters.
QUEEN.
If he be old enough, what needs your grace
To be protector of his excellence?
GLOSTER.
Madam, I am protector of the realm,
And, at his pleasure, will resign my place.
SUFFOLK.
Resign it then, and leave thine insolence.
Since thou wert king--as who is king but thou?--
The commonwealth hath daily run to wrack;
The Dauphin hath prevail'd beyond the seas;
And all the peers and nobles of the realm
Have been as bondmen to thy sovereignty.
CARDINAL.
The commons hast thou rack'd; the clergy's bags
Are lank and lean with thy extortions.
SOMERSET.
Thy sumptuous buildings and thy wife's attire
Have cost a mass of public treasury.
BUCKINGHAM.
Thy cruelty in execution
Upon offenders hath exceeded law,
And left thee to the mercy of the law.
QUEEN.
Thy sale of offices and towns in France,
If they were known, as the suspect is great,
Would make thee quickly hop without thy head.--
[Exit Gloster. The Queen drops her fan..]
Give me my fan. What minion! can ye not?
[She gives the Duchess a box on the ear.]
I cry your mercy, madam; was it you?
DUCHESS.
Was 't I! yea, I it was, proud Frenchwoman.
Could I come near your beauty with my nails,
I'd set my ten commandments in your face.
KING.
Sweet aunt, be quiet; 't was against her will.
DUCHESS.
Against her will! good king, look to 't in time;
She'll hamper thee and dandle thee like a baby.
Though in this place most master wear no breeches,
She shall not strike Dame Eleanor unreveng'd.
