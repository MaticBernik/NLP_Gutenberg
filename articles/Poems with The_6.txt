VENICE.
SONNET
                      WRITTEN IN HOLY WEEK AT GENOA
   I WANDERED through Scogliettos far retreat,
      The oranges on each oerhanging spray
      Burned as bright lamps of gold to shame the day;
   Some startled bird with fluttering wings and fleet
   Made snow of all the blossoms; at my feet
      Like silver moons the pale narcissi lay:
      And the curved waves that streaked the great green bay
   Laughed i the sun, and life seemed very sweet.
   Outside the young boy-priest passed singing clear,
      Jesus the son of Mary has been slain,
      O come and fill His sepulchre with flowers.
   Ah, God!  Ah, God! those dear Hellenic hours
      Had drowned all memory of Thy bitter pain,
      The Cross, the Crown, the Soldiers and the Spear.
ROME UNVISITED
                                     I.
   THE corn has turned from grey to red,
      Since first my spirit wandered forth
      From the drear cities of the north,
   And to Italias mountains fled.
   And here I set my face towards home,
      For all my pilgrimage is done,
      Although, methinks, yon blood-red sun
   Marshals the way to Holy Rome.
   O Blessed Lady, who dost hold
      Upon the seven hills thy reign!
      O Mother without blot or stain,
   Crowned with bright crowns of triple gold!
   O Roma, Roma, at thy feet
      I lay this barren gift of song!
      For, ah! the way is steep and long
   That leads unto thy sacred street.
                                     II.
   AND yet what joy it were for me
      To turn my feet unto the south,
      And journeying towards the Tiber mouth
   To kneel again at Fiesole!
   And wandering through the tangled pines
      That break the gold of Arnos stream,
      To see the purple mist and gleam
   Of morning on the Apennines
   By many a vineyard-hidden home,
      Orchard and olive-garden grey,
      Till from the drear Campagnas way
   The seven hills bear up the dome!
                                    III.
   A PILGRIM from the northern seas
      What joy for me to seek alone
      The wondrous temple and the throne
   Of him who holds the awful keys!
   When, bright with purple and with gold
      Come priest and holy cardinal,
      And borne above the heads of all
   The gentle Shepherd of the Fold.
   O joy to see before I die
      The only God-anointed king,
      And hear the silver trumpets ring
   A triumph as he passes by!
   Or at the brazen-pillared shrine
      Holds high the mystic sacrifice,
      And shows his God to human eyes
   Beneath the veil of bread and wine.
                                     IV.
   FOR lo, what changes time can bring!
      The cycles of revolving years
      May free my heart from all its fears,
   And teach my lips a song to sing.
   Before yon field of trembling gold
      Is garnered into dusty sheaves,
      Or ere the autumns scarlet leaves
   Flutter as birds adown the wold,
   I may have run the glorious race,
      And caught the torch while yet aflame,
      And called upon the holy name
   Of Him who now doth hide His face.
ARONA.
URBS SACRA ATERNA
   ROME! what a scroll of History thine has been;
      In the first days thy sword republican
      Ruled the whole world for many an ages span:
   Then of the peoples wert thou royal Queen,
   Till in thy streets the bearded Goth was seen;
      And now upon thy walls the breezes fan
      (Ah, city crowned by God, discrowned by man!)
   The hated flag of red and white and green.
   When was thy glory! when in search for power
      Thine eagles flew to greet the double sun,
      And the wild nations shuddered at thy rod?
   Nay, but thy glory tarried for this hour,
      When pilgrims kneel before the Holy One,
      The prisoned shepherd of the Church of God.
