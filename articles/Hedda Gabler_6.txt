HEDDA.
I really did not look closely at it, Miss Tesman.
MISS TESMAN.
[Trying on the bonnet.] Let me tell you it's the first time I have worn
it--the very first time.
TESMAN.
And a very nice bonnet it is too--quite a beauty!
MISS TESMAN.
Oh, it's no such great things, George. [Looks around her.] My
parasol--? Ah, here. [Takes it.] For this is mine too-- [mutters] --not
Berta's.
TESMAN.
A new bonnet and a new parasol! Only think, Hedda.
HEDDA.
Very handsome indeed.
TESMAN.
Yes, isn't it? Eh? But Auntie, take a good look at Hedda before you go!
See how handsome she is!
MISS TESMAN.
Oh, my dear boy, there's nothing new in that. Hedda was always lovely.
     [She nods and goes toward the right.
TESMAN.
[Following.] Yes, but have you noticed what splendid condition she is
in? How she has filled out on the journey?
HEDDA.
[Crossing the room.] Oh, do be quiet--!
MISS TESMAN.
[Who has stopped and turned.] Filled out?
TESMAN.
Of course you don't notice it so much now that she has that dress on.
But I, who can see--
HEDDA.
[At the glass door, impatiently.] Oh, you can't see anything.
TESMAN.
It must be the mountain air in the Tyrol--
HEDDA.
[Curtly, interrupting.] I am exactly as I was when I started.
TESMAN.
So you insist; but I'm quite certain you are not. Don't you agree with
me, Auntie?
MISS TESMAN.
[Who has been gazing at her with folded hands.] Hedda is lovely--
lovely--lovely. [Goes up to her, takes her head between both hands,
draws it downwards, and kisses her hair.] God bless and preserve Hedda
Tesman--for George's sake.
HEDDA.
[Gently freeing herself.] Oh--! Let me go.
MISS TESMAN.
[In quiet emotion.] I shall not let a day pass without coming to see
you.
TESMAN.
No you won't, will you, Auntie? Eh?
MISS TESMAN.
Good-bye--good-bye!
     [She goes out by the hall door.  TESMAN accompanies her.  The
       door remains half open.  TESMAN can be heard repeating his
       message to Aunt Rina and his thanks for the slippers.
     [In the meantime, HEDDA walks about the room, raising her arms
       and clenching her hands as if in desperation.  Then she flings
       back the curtains from the glass door, and stands there looking
       out.
     [Presently, TESMAN returns and closes the door behind him.
TESMAN.
[Picks up the slippers from the floor.] What are you looking at, Hedda?
HEDDA.
[Once more calm and mistress of herself.] I am only looking at the
leaves. They are so yellow--so withered.
TESMAN.
[Wraps up the slippers and lays them on the table.] Well, you see, we
are well into September now.
HEDDA.
[Again restless.] Yes, to think of it!--already in--in September.
TESMAN.
Don't you think Aunt Julia's manner was strange, dear? Almost solemn?
Can you imagine what was the matter with her? Eh?
HEDDA.
I scarcely know her, you see. Is she not often like that?
TESMAN.
No, not as she was to-day.
HEDDA.
[Leaving the glass door.] Do you think she was annoyed about the bonnet?
