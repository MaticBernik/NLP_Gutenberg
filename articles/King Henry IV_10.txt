POINS.
Why, because you have been so lewd and so much engraffed
to Falstaff.
PRINCE.
And to thee.
POINS.
By this light, I am well spoke on; I can hear it with mine own
ears:  the worst that they can say of me is that I am a second
brother and that I am a proper fellow of my hands; and those two
things, I confess, I cannot help. By the mass, here comes Bardolph.
[Enter Bardolph and Page.]
PRINCE.
And the boy that I gave Falstaff:  'a had him from me Christian;
and look, if the fat villain have not transformed him ape.
BARDOLPH.
God save your grace!
PRINCE.
And yours, most noble Bardolph!
POINS.
Come, you virtuous ass, you bashful fool, must you be blushing?
wherefore blush you now? What a maidenly man-at-arms are you become!
Is 't such a matter to get a pottle-pot's maidenhead?
PAGE.
'A calls me e'en now, my lord, through a red lattice, and I could
discern no part of his face from the window:  at last I spied his
eyes, and methought he had made two holes in the ale-wife's new
petticoat and so peep'd through.
PRINCE.
Has not the boy profited?
BARDOLPH.
Away, you whoreson upright rabbit, away!
PAGE.
Away, you rascally Althaea's dream, away!
PRINCE.
Instruct us, boy; what dream, boy?
PAGE.
Marry, my lord, Althaea dreamt she was delivered of a
fire-brand; and therefore I call him her dream.
PRINCE.
A crown's worth of good interpretation:  there 'tis, boy.
POINS.
O, that this blossom could be kept from cankers!  Well,
there is sixpence to preserve thee.
BARDOLPH.
An you do not make him hanged among you, the gallows
shall have wrong.
PRINCE.
And how doth thy master, Bardolph?
BARDOLPH.
Well, my lord. He heard of your grace's coming to town:
there's a letter for you.
POINS.
Deliver'd with good respect. And how doth the martlemas,
your master?
BARDOLPH.
In bodily health, sir.
POINS.
Marry, the immortal part needs a physician; but that moves
not him:  though that be sick, it dies not.
PRINCE.
I do allow this wen to be as familiar with me as my dog;
and he holds his place; for look you how he writes.
POINS.
[Reads.] "John Falstaff, knight,"--every man must know that, as oft
as he has occasion to name himself:  even like those that are kin
to the king; for they never prick their finger but they say,
"There's some of the king's blood spilt."
"How comes that?" says he, that takes upon him not to conceive.
The answer is as ready as a borrower's cap,
"I am the king's poor cousin, sir."
PRINCE.
Nay, they will be kin to us, or they will fetch it from Japhet.
But to the letter:
POINS.
[Reads] "Sir John Falstaff, knight, to the son of the king,
nearest his father, Harry Prince of Wales, greeting."  Why, this
is a certificate.
PRINCE.
Peace!
POINS.
[Reads.] "I will imitate the honourable Romans in brevity:"  he sure
means brevity in breath, short-winded.  "I commend me to thee, I commend
thee, and I leave thee. Be not too familiar with Poins; for he misuses
thy favours so much, that he swears thou art to marry his sister Nell.
Repent at idle times as thou mayest; and so, farewell.
     "Thine, by yea and no, which is as much as to say, as thou
usest him,
     JACK FALSTAFF with my familiars, JOHN with my brothers and
     sisters, and SIR JOHN with all Europe."
My lord, I'll steep this letter in sack and make him eat it.
