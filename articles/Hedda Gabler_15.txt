BRACK.
Perhaps I can give you some information on that point.
TESMAN.
Indeed!
BRACK.
You must remember that his relations have a good deal of influence.
TESMAN.
Oh, his relations, unfortunately, have entirely washed their hands of
him.
BRACK.
At one time they called him the hope of the family.
TESMAN.
At one time, yes! But he has put an end to all that.
HEDDA.
Who knows? [With a slight smile.] I hear they have reclaimed him up at
Sheriff Elvsted's--
BRACK.
And then this book that he has published--
TESMAN.
Well well, I hope to goodness they may find something for him to do. I
have just written to him. I asked him to come and see us this evening,
Hedda dear.
BRACK.
But my dear fellow, you are booked for my bachelor's party this evening.
You promised on the pier last night.
HEDDA.
Had you forgotten, Tesman?
TESMAN.
Yes, I had utterly forgotten.
BRACK.
But it doesn't matter, for you may be sure he won't come.
TESMAN.
What makes you think that? Eh?
BRACK.
[With a little hesitation, rising and resting his hands on the back of
his chair.] My dear Tesman--and you too, Mrs. Tesman--I think I ought
not to keep you in the dark about something that--that--
TESMAN.
That concerns Eilert--?
BRACK.
Both you and him.
TESMAN.
Well, my dear Judge, out with it.
BRACK.
You must be prepared to find your appointment deferred longer than you
desired or expected.
TESMAN.
[Jumping up uneasily.] Is there some hitch about it? Eh?
BRACK.
The nomination may perhaps be made conditional on the result of a
competition--
TESMAN.
Competition! Think of that, Hedda!
HEDDA.
[Leans further back in the chair.] Aha--aha!
TESMAN.
But who can my competitor be? Surely not--?
BRACK.
Yes, precisely--Eilert Lovborg.
TESMAN.
[Clasping his hands.] No, no--it's quite impossible! Eh?
BRACK.
H'm--that is what it may come to, all the same.
TESMAN.
Well but, Judge Brack--it would show the most incredible lack of
consideration for me. [Gesticulates with his arms.] For--just think--I'm
a married man! We have married on the strength of these prospects, Hedda
and I; and run deep into debt; and borrowed money from Aunt Julia too.
Good heavens, they had as good as promised me the appointment. Eh?
BRACK.
Well, well, well--no doubt you will get it in the end; only after a
contest.
HEDDA.
[Immovable in her arm-chair.] Fancy, Tesman, there will be a sort of
sporting interest in that.
TESMAN.
Why, my dearest Hedda, how can you be so indifferent about it?
HEDDA.
[As before.] I am not at all indifferent. I am most eager to see who
wins.
BRACK.
In any case, Mrs. Tesman, it is best that you should know how matters
stand. I mean--before you set about the little purchases I hear you are
threatening.
HEDDA.
This can make no difference.
BRACK.
Indeed! Then I have no more to say. Good-bye! [To TESMAN.] I shall look
in on my way back from my afternoon walk, and take you home with me.
