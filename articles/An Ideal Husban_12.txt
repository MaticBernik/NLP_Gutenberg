SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Gertrude!
LADY CHILTERN.  I know that there are men with horrible secrets in their
lives--men who have done some shameful thing, and who in some critical
moment have to pay for it, by doing some other act of shame--oh! don't
tell me you are such as they are!  Robert, is there in your life any
secret dishonour or disgrace?  Tell me, tell me at once, that--
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  That what?
LADY CHILTERN.  [_Speaking very slowly_.]  That our lives may drift
apart.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Drift apart?
LADY CHILTERN.  That they may be entirely separate.  It would be better
for us both.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Gertrude, there is nothing in my past life that you
might not know.
LADY CHILTERN.  I was sure of it, Robert, I was sure of it.  But why did
you say those dreadful things, things so unlike your real self?  Don't
let us ever talk about the subject again.  You will write, won't you, to
Mrs. Cheveley, and tell her that you cannot support this scandalous
scheme of hers?  If you have given her any promise you must take it back,
that is all!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Must I write and tell her that?
LADY CHILTERN.  Surely, Robert!  What else is there to do?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I might see her personally.  It would be better.
LADY CHILTERN.  You must never see her again, Robert.  She is not a woman
you should ever speak to.  She is not worthy to talk to a man like you.
No; you must write to her at once, now, this moment, and let your letter
show her that your decision is quite irrevocable!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Write this moment!
LADY CHILTERN.  Yes.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  But it is so late.  It is close on twelve.
LADY CHILTERN.  That makes no matter.  She must know at once that she has
been mistaken in you--and that you are not a man to do anything base or
underhand or dishonourable.  Write here, Robert.  Write that you decline
to support this scheme of hers, as you hold it to be a dishonest scheme.
Yes--write the word dishonest.  She knows what that word means.  [SIR
ROBERT CHILTERN _sits down and writes a letter_.  _His wife takes it up
and reads it_.]  Yes; that will do.  [_Rings bell_.]  And now the
envelope.  [_He writes the envelope slowly_.  _Enter_ MASON.]  Have this
letter sent at once to Claridge's Hotel.  There is no answer.  [_Exit_
MASON.  LADY CHILTERN _kneels down beside her husband_, _and puts her
arms around him_.]  Robert, love gives one an instinct to things.  I feel
to-night that I have saved you from something that might have been a
danger to you, from something that might have made men honour you less
than they do.  I don't think you realise sufficiently, Robert, that you
have brought into the political life of our time a nobler atmosphere, a
finer attitude towards life, a freer air of purer aims and higher
ideals--I know it, and for that I love you, Robert.
