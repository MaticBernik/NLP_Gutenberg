_Servant_ (_at the hall door_). Excuse me, ma'am--there is a gentleman
to see the master, and as the doctor is with him--
_Nora_. Who is it?
_Krogstad_ (_at the door_). It is I, Mrs. Helmer. (_Mrs._ LINDE _starts,
trembles, and turns to the window_.)
_Nora_ (_takes a step towards him, and speaks in a strained low voice_).
You? What is it? What do you want to see my husband about?
_Krogstad_. Bank business--in a way. I have a small post in the Bank,
and I hear your husband is to be our chief now--
_Nora_. Then it is--
_Krogstad_. Nothing but dry business matters, Mrs. Helmers; absolutely
nothing else.
_Nora_. Be so good as to go into the study then. (_She bows
indifferently to him and shuts the door into the hall; then comes back
and makes up the fire in the stove_.)
_Mrs. Linde_. Nora--who was that man?
_Nora_. A lawyer, of the name of Krogstad.
_Mrs. Linde_. Then it really was he.
_Nora_. Do you know the man?
_Mrs. Linde_. I used to--many years ago. At one time he was a
solicitor's clerk in our town.
_Nora_. Yes, he was.
_Mrs. Linde_. He is greatly altered.
_Nora_. He made a very unhappy marriage.
_Mrs. Linde_. He is a widower now, isn't he?
_Nora_. With several children. There now, it is burning up. (_Shuts the
door of the stove and moves the rocking-chair aside_.)
_Mrs. Linde_. They say he carries on various kinds of business.
_Nora_. Really! Perhaps he does; I don't know anything about it. But
don't let us think of business; it is so tiresome.
_Doctor Rank_ (_comes out of_ HELMER'S _study. Before he shuts the door
he calls to him_). No, my dear fellow, I won't disturb you; I would
rather go in to your wife for a little while. (_Shuts the door and sees_
Mrs. LINDE.) I beg your pardon; I am afraid I am disturbing you too.
_Nora_. No, not at all. (_Introducing him_.) Doctor Rank, Mrs. Linde.
_Rank_. I have often heard Mrs. Linde's name mentioned here. I think I
passed you on the stairs when I arrived, Mrs. Linde?
_Mrs. Linde_. Yes, I go up very slowly; I can't manage stairs well.
_Rank_. Ah! some slight internal weakness?
_Mrs. Linde_. No, the fact is I have been overworking myself.
_Rank_. Nothing more than that? Then I suppose you have come to town to
amuse yourself with our entertainments?
_Mrs. Linde_. I have come to look for work.
_Rank_. Is that a good cure for overwork?
_Mrs. Linde_. One must live, Doctor Rank.
_Rank_. Yes, the general opinion seems to be that it is necessary.
_Nora_. Look here, Doctor Rank--you know you want to live.
_Rank_. Certainly. However wretched I may feel, I want to prolong the
agony as long as possible. All my patients are like that. And so are
those who are morally diseased; one of them, and a bad case, too, is at
this very moment with Helmer--
_Mrs. Linde_ (_sadly_). Ah!
