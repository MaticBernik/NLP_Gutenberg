However, according to the English proverb, he that is shipped with the
devil must sail with the devil; I was among them, and I managed myself
as well as I could. My master had consented that I should assist the
captain in the office, as above; but, as I understood afterwards that
the captain allowed my master half a moidore a month for my service, and
that he had my name upon the ship's books also, I expected that when
the ship came to be paid four months' wages at the Indies, as they, it
seems, always do, my master would let me have something for myself.
But I was wrong in my man, for he was none of that kind; he had taken
me up as in distress, and his business was to keep me so, and make his
market of me as well as he could, which I began to think of after a
different manner than I did at first, for at first I thought he had
entertained me in mere charity, upon seeing my distressed circumstances,
but did not doubt but when he put me on board the ship, I should have
some wages for my service.
But he thought, it seems, quite otherwise; and when I procured one to
speak to him about it, when the ship was paid at Goa, he flew into the
greatest rage imaginable, and called me English dog, young heretic, and
threatened to put me into the Inquisition. Indeed, of all the names
the four-and-twenty letters could make up, he should not have called me
heretic; for as I knew nothing about religion, neither Protestant from
Papist, or either of them from a Mahometan, I could never be a heretic.
However, it passed but a little, but, as young as I was, I had been
carried into the Inquisition, and there, if they had asked me if I was
a Protestant or a Catholic, I should have said yes to that which came
first. If it had been the Protestant they had asked first, it had
certainly made a martyr of me for I did not know what.
But the very priest they carried with them, or chaplain of the ship,
as we called him, saved me; for seeing me a boy entirely ignorant of
religion, and ready to do or say anything they bid me, he asked me some
questions about it, which he found I answered so very simply, that
he took it upon him to tell them he would answer for my being a good
Catholic, and he hoped he should be the means of saving my soul, and he
pleased himself that it was to be a work of merit to him; so he made me
as good a Papist as any of them in about a week's time.
I then told him my case about my master; how, it is true, he had taken
me up in a miserable case on board a man-of-war at Lisbon; and I was
indebted to him for bringing me on board this ship; that if I had been
left at Lisbon, I might have starved, and the like; and therefore I
was willing to serve him, but that I hoped he would give me some little
consideration for my service, or let me know how long he expected I
should serve him for nothing.
