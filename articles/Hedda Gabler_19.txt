BRACK.
[Laughing.] Well, I can't answer for all the rest; but as for myself,
you know quite well that I have always entertained a--a certain respect
for the marriage tie--for marriage as an institution, Mrs. Hedda.
HEDDA.
[Jestingly.] Oh, I assure you I have never cherished any hopes with
respect to you.
BRACK.
All I require is a pleasant and intimate interior, where I can make
myself useful in every way, and am free to come and go as--as a trusted
friend--
HEDDA.
Of the master of the house, do you mean?
BRACK.
[Bowing.] Frankly--of the mistress first of all; but of course of the
master too, in the second place. Such a triangular friendship--if I may
call it so--is really a great convenience for all the parties, let me
tell you.
HEDDA.
Yes, I have many a time longed for some one to make a third on our
travels. Oh--those railway-carriage _tete-a-tetes_--!
BRACK.
Fortunately your wedding journey is over now.
HEDDA.
[Shaking her head.] Not by a long--long way. I have only arrived at a
station on the line.
BRACK.
Well, then the passengers jump out and move about a little, Mrs. Hedda.
HEDDA.
I never jump out.
BRACK.
Really?
HEDDA.
No--because there is always some one standing by to--
BRACK.
[Laughing.] To look at your ankles, do you mean?
HEDDA.
Precisely.
BRACK.
Well but, dear me--
HEDDA.
[With a gesture of repulsion.] I won't have it. I would rather keep my
seat where I happen to be--and continue the _tete-a-tete_.
BRACK.
But suppose a third person were to jump in and join the couple.
HEDDA.
Ah--that is quite another matter!
BRACK.
A trusted, sympathetic friend--
HEDDA.
--with a fund of conversation on all sorts of lively topics--
BRACK.
--and not the least bit of a specialist!
HEDDA.
[With an audible sigh.] Yes, that would be a relief indeed.
BRACK.
[Hears the front door open, and glances in that direction.] The triangle
is completed.
HEDDA.
[Half aloud.] And on goes the train.
  GEORGE TESMAN, in a grey walking-suit, with a soft felt hat,
  enters from the hall.  He has a number of unbound books under
  his arm and in his pockets.
TESMAN.
[Goes up to the table beside the corner settee.] Ouf--what a load for
a warm day--all these books. [Lays them on the table.] I'm positively
perspiring, Hedda. Hallo--are you there already, my dear Judge? Eh?
Berta didn't tell me.
BRACK.
[Rising.] I came in through the garden.
HEDDA.
What books have you got there?
TESMAN.
[Stands looking them through.] Some new books on my special subjects
--quite indispensable to me.
HEDDA.
Your special subjects?
BRACK.
Yes, books on his special subjects, Mrs. Tesman.
   [BRACK and HEDDA exchange a confidential smile.
HEDDA.
Do you need still more books on your special subjects?
TESMAN.
Yes, my dear Hedda, one can never have too many of them. Of course one
must keep up with all that is written and published.
HEDDA.
Yes, I suppose one must.
TESMAN.
[Searching among his books.] And look here--I have got hold of Eilert
Lovborg's new book too. [Offering it to her.] Perhaps you would like to
glance through it, Hedda? Eh?
