DUCHESS
   Dear love, I would
   You could look upon me ever, for your eyes
   Are polished mirrors, and when I peer
   Into those mirrors I can see myself,
   And so I know my image lives in you.
GUIDO [_taking her in his arms_]
   Stand still, thou hurrying orb in the high heavens,
   And make this hour immortal!  [_A pause_.]
DUCHESS
   Sit down here,
   A little lower than me: yes, just so, sweet,
   That I may run my fingers through your hair,
   And see your face turn upwards like a flower
   To meet my kiss.
   Have you not sometimes noted,
   When we unlock some long-disuséd room
   With heavy dust and soiling mildew filled,
   Where never foot of man has come for years,
   And from the windows take the rusty bar,
   And fling the broken shutters to the air,
   And let the bright sun in, how the good sun
   Turns every grimy particle of dust
   Into a little thing of dancing gold?
   Guido, my heart is that long-empty room,
   But you have let love in, and with its gold
   Gilded all life.  Do you not think that love
   Fills up the sum of life?
GUIDO
   Ay! without love
   Life is no better than the unhewn stone
   Which in the quarry lies, before the sculptor
   Has set the God within it.  Without love
   Life is as silent as the common reeds
   That through the marshes or by rivers grow,
   And have no music in them.
DUCHESS
   Yet out of these
   The singer, who is Love, will make a pipe
   And from them he draws music; so I think
   Love will bring music out of any life.
   Is that not true?
GUIDO
   Sweet, women make it true.
   There are men who paint pictures, and carve statues,
   Paul of Verona and the dyers son,
   Or their great rival, who, by the sea at Venice,
   Has set Gods little maid upon the stair,
   White as her own white lily, and as tall,
   Or Raphael, whose Madonnas are divine
   Because they are mothers merely; yet I think
   Women are the best artists of the world,
   For they can take the common lives of men
   Soiled with the money-getting of our age,
   And with love make them beautiful.
DUCHESS
   Ah, dear,
   I wish that you and I were very poor;
   The poor, who love each other, are so rich.
GUIDO
   Tell me again you love me, Beatrice.
DUCHESS [_fingering his collar_]
   How well this collar lies about your throat.
   [LORD MORANZONE _looks through the door from the corridor outside_.]
GUIDO
   Nay, tell me that you love me.
DUCHESS
   I remember,
   That when I was a child in my dear France,
   Being at Court at Fontainebleau, the King
   Wore such a collar.
GUIDO
   Will you not say you love me?
DUCHESS [_smiling_]
   He was a very royal man, King Francis,
   Yet he was not royal as you are.
   Why need I tell you, Guido, that I love you?
      [_Takes his head in her hands and turns his face up to her_.]
