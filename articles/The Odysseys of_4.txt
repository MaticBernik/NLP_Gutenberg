<U+202D>  THE FOURTH BOOK OF HOMERS ODYSSEYS
<U+202D>  THE ARGUMENT
<U+202D>  Receivd now in the Spartan court,
<U+202D>  Telemachus prefers report
<U+202D>  To Menelaus of the throng
<U+202D>  Of Wooers with him, and their wrong.
<U+202D>  Atrides tells the Greeks retreat,
<U+202D>  And doth a prophecy repeat
<U+202D>  That Proteus made, by which he knew
<U+202D>  His brothers death; and then doth show
<U+202D>  How with Calypso livd the sire
<U+202D>  Of his young guest.  The Wooers conspire
<U+202D>  Their princes death. Whose treachry known,
<U+202D>  Penelope in tears doth drown.
<U+202D>  Whom Pallas by a dream doth cheer,
<U+202D>  And in similitude appear
<U+202D>  Of fair Iphthima, known to be
<U+202D>  The sister of Penelope.
<U+202D>  ANOTHER ARGUMENT
<U+202D>  _<U+0394><U+1F10><U+03BB><U+03C4><U+03B1>._
<U+202D>     Here of the sire
<U+202D>        The son doth hear.
<U+202D>     The Wooers conspire.
<U+202D>        The Mothers fear.
<U+202D>  In Lacedamon now, the nurse of whales,  [1]
<U+202D>  These two arrivd, and found at festivals,
<U+202D>  With mighty concourse, the renownéd king,
<U+202D>  His son and daughter jointly marrying.
<U+202D>  Alectors daughter he did give his son,
<U+202D>  Strong Megapenthes, who his life begun
<U+202D>  By Menelaus bondmaid; whom he knew
<U+202D>  In years when Helen could no more renew
<U+202D>  In issue like divine Hermione,
<U+202D>  Who held in all fair form as high degree
<U+202D>  As golden Venus.  Her he married now
<U+202D>  To great Achilles son, who was by vow
<U+202D>  Betrothd to her at Troy, And thus the Gods
<U+202D>  To constant loves give nuptial periods.
<U+202D>  Whose state here past, the Myrmidons rich town
<U+202D>  (Of which she shard in the imperial crown)
<U+202D>  With horse and chariots he resignd her to.
<U+202D>  Mean space, the high huge house with feast did flow
<U+202D>  Of friends and neighbours, joying with the king.
<U+202D>  Amongst whom did a heavnly poet sing,
<U+202D>  And touch his harp.  Amongst whom likewise dancd
<U+202D>  Two, who in that dumb motion advancd,
<U+202D>  Would prompt the singer what to sing and play.  [2]
<U+202D>  All this time in the utter court did stay,
<U+202D>  With horse and chariot, Telemachus,
<U+202D>  And Nestors noble son Pisistratus.
<U+202D>  Whom Eteoneus, coming forth, descried,
<U+202D>  And, being a servant to the king, most tried
<U+202D>  In care and his respect, he ran and cried:
<U+202D>  Guests, Jove-kept Menelaus, two such men
<U+202D>  As are for form of high Saturnius strain.
<U+202D>  Inform your pleasure, if we shall unclose
<U+202D>  Their horse from coach, or say they must dispose
<U+202D>  Their way to some such house, as may embrace
<U+202D>  Their known arrival with more welcome grace?
<U+202D>     He, angry, answerd:  Thou didst never show
<U+202D>  Thyself a fool, Boethides, till now;
<U+202D>  But now, as if turnd child, a childish speech
<U+202D>  Vents thy vain spirits.  We ourselves now reach
<U+202D>  Our home by much spent hospitality
<U+202D>  Of other men; nor know if Jove will try
<U+202D>  With other after-wants our state again;
<U+202D>  And therefore from our feast no more detain
<U+202D>  Those welcome guests, but take their steeds from coach,
<U+202D>  And with attendance guide in their approach.
<U+202D>     This said, he rushd abroad, and calld some more
<U+202D>  Tried in such service, that together bore
<U+202D>  Up to the guests, and took their steeds that swet
<U+202D>  Beneath their yokes from coach; at mangers set,
<U+202D>  Wheat and white barley gave them mixd; and placd
<U+202D>  Their chariot by a wall so clear, it cast
<U+202D>  A light quite through it.  And then they led
<U+202D>  Their guests to the divine house; which so fed
<U+202D>  Their eyes at all parts with illustrious sights,
<U+202D>  That admiration seizd them.  Like the lights
<U+202D>  The sun and moon gave, all the palace threw
<U+202D>  A lustre through it.  Satiate with whose view,
<U+202D>  Down to the kings most bright-kept baths they went,
<U+202D>  Where handmaids did their services present,
<U+202D>  Bathd, balmd them, shirts and well-napt weeds put on,
<U+202D>  And by Atrides side set each his throne.
<U+202D>  Then did the handmaid-royal water bring,
<U+202D>  And to a laver, rich and glittering,
<U+202D>  Of massy gold, pourd; which she placd upon
<U+202D>  A silver caldron, into which might run
<U+202D>  The water as they washd.  Then set she near
<U+202D>  A polishd table, on which all the cheer
<U+202D>  The present could afford a revrend dame,
<U+202D>  That kept the larder, set.  A cook then came,
<U+202D>  And divers dishes, borne thence, servd again;
<U+202D>  Furnishd the board with bowls of gold.  And then,
<U+202D>  His right hand givn the guests, Atrides said:
<U+202D>  Eat, and be cheerful.  Appetite allayd,
<U+202D>  I long to ask, of what stock ye descend;
<U+202D>  For not from parents whose race nameless end
<U+202D>  We must derive your offspring.  Men obscure
<U+202D>  Could get none such as you.  The portraiture
<U+202D>  Of Jove-sustaind and sceptre-bearing kings
<U+202D>  Your either person in his presence brings.
<U+202D>  An oxs fat chine then they up did lift,
<U+202D>  And set before the guests; which was a gift,
<U+202D>  Sent as an honour to the kings own taste.
<U+202D>  They saw yet twas but to be eaten placd,
<U+202D>  And fell to it.  But food and wines care past,
<U+202D>  Telemachus thus prompted Nestors son,
<U+202D>  (His ear close laying, to be heard of none):  [3]
<U+202D>     Consider, thou whom most of my mind esteems,
<U+202D>  The brass-work here, how rich it is in beams,
<U+202D>  And how, besides, it makes the whole house sound;
<U+202D>  What gold, and amber, silver, ivory, round
<U+202D>  Is wrought about it.  Out of doubt, the hall
<U+202D>  Of Jupiter Olympius hath of all
<U+202D>  This state the like.  How many infinites
<U+202D>  Take up to admiration all mens sights!
<U+202D>     Atrides over-heard, and said:  Lovd son,
<U+202D>  No mortal must affect contentión
<U+202D>  With Jove, whose dwellings are of endless date.
<U+202D>  Perhaps of men some one may emulate,
<U+202D>  Or none, my house, or me; for I am one
<U+202D>  That many a grave extreme have undergone,
<U+202D>  Much error felt by sea, and till th eighth year,
<U+202D>  Had never stay, but wanderd far and near,
<U+202D>  Cyprus, Phonicia, and Sidonia,
<U+202D>  And fetchd the far-off Athiopia,
<U+202D>  Reachd the Erembi of Arabia,
<U+202D>  And Lybia, where with horns ewes yean their lambs,
<U+202D>  Which evry full year ewes are three times dams,
<U+202D>  Where neither king, nor shepherd, want comes near
<U+202D>  Of cheese, or flesh, or sweet milk; all the year
<U+202D>  They ever milk their ewes.  And here while I
<U+202D>  Errd, gathring means to live, one, murdrously,
<U+202D>  Unwares, unseen, bereft my brothers life,
<U+202D>  Chiefly betrayd by his abhorréd wife.
<U+202D>  So hold I, not enjoying, what you see.
<U+202D>  And of your fathers, if they living be,
<U+202D>  You must have heard this, since my suffrings were
<U+202D>  So great and famous; from this palace here
<U+202D>  (So rarely-well-built, furnishéd so well,
<U+202D>  And substancéd with such a precious deal
<U+202D>  Of well-got treasure) banishd by the doom
<U+202D>  Of Fate, and erring as I had no home.
<U+202D>  And now I have, and use it, not to take
<U+202D>  Th entire delight it offers, but to make
<U+202D>  Continual wishes, that a triple part
<U+202D>  Of all it holds were wanting, so my heart
<U+202D>  Were easd of sorrows, taken for their deaths
<U+202D>  That fell at Troy, by their revivéd breaths.
<U+202D>  And thus sit I here weeping, mourning still
<U+202D>  Each least man lost; and sometimes make mine ill,
<U+202D>  In paying just tears for their loss, my joy.
<U+202D>  Sometimes I breathe my woes, for in annoy
<U+202D>  The pleasure soon admits satiety.
<U+202D>  But all these mens wants wet not so mine eye,
<U+202D>  Though much they move me, as one sole mans miss,
<U+202D>  For which my sleep and meat evn loathsome is
<U+202D>  In his renewd thought, since no Greek hath won
<U+202D>  Grace for such labours as Laërtes son
<U+202D>  Hath wrought and sufferd, to himself nought else
<U+202D>  But future sorrows forging, to me hells
<U+202D>  For his long absence, since I cannot know
<U+202D>  If life or death detain him; since such woe
<U+202D>  For his love, old Laërtes, his wise wife,
<U+202D>  And poor young son sustains, whom new with life
<U+202D>  He left as sireless.  This speech grief to tears
<U+202D>  (Pourd from the sons lids on the earth) his ears,
<U+202D>  Told of the father, did excite; who kept
<U+202D>  His cheeks dry with his red weed as he wept,
<U+202D>  His both hands usd therein.  Atrides then
<U+202D>  Began to know him, and did strife retain,
<U+202D>  If he should let himself confess his sire,
<U+202D>  Or with all fitting circumstance enquire.
<U+202D>     While this his thoughts disputed, forth did shine,
<U+202D>  Like to the golden distaff-deckd Divine,
<U+202D>  From her beds high and odoriferous room,
<U+202D>  Helen.  To whom, of an elaborate loom,
<U+202D>  Adresta set a chair; Alcippe brought
<U+202D>  A piece of tapestry of fine wool wrought;
<U+202D>  Phylo a silver cabinet conferrd,
<U+202D>  Givn by Alcandra, nuptially endeard
<U+202D>  To lord Polybius, whose abode in Thebes
<U+202D>  Th Agyptian city was, where wealth in heaps
<U+202D>  His famous house held, out of which did go,
<U+202D>  In gift t Atrides, silver bath-tubs two,
<U+202D>  Two tripods, and of fine gold talents ten.
<U+202D>  His wife did likewise send to Helen then
<U+202D>  Fair gifts, a distaff that of gold was wrought,
<U+202D>  And that rich cabinet that Phylo brought,
<U+202D>  Round, and with gold ribbd, now of fine thread full;
<U+202D>  On which extended (crownd with finest wool,
<U+202D>  Of violet gloss) the golden distaff-lay.
<U+202D>     She took her state-chair, and a foot-stools stay
<U+202D>  Had for her feet; and of her husband thus
<U+202D>  Askd to know all things:  Is it known to us,
<U+202D>  King Menelaus, whom these men commend
<U+202D>  Themselves for, that our court now takes to friend?
<U+202D>  I must affirm, be I deceivd or no,
<U+202D>  I never yet saw man nor woman so
<U+202D>  Like one another, as this man is like
<U+202D>  Ulysses son.  With admiration strike
<U+202D>  His looks my thoughts, that they should carry now
<U+202D>  Powr to persuade me thus, who did but know,
<U+202D>  When newly he was born, the form they bore.
<U+202D>  But tis his fathers grace, whom more and more
<U+202D>  His grace resembles, that makes me retain
<U+202D>  Thought that he now is like Telemachus, then
<U+202D>  Left by his sire, when Greece did undertake
<U+202D>  Troys bold war for my impudencys sake.
<U+202D>     He answerd:  Now wife, what you think I know,
<U+202D>  The true cast of his fathers eye doth show
<U+202D>  In his eyes order.  Both his head and hair,
<U+202D>  His hands and feet, his very fathers are.
<U+202D>  Of whom, so well rememberd, I should now
<U+202D>  Acknowledge for me his continual flow
<U+202D>  Of cares and perils, yet still patient.
<U+202D>  But I should too much move him, that doth vent
<U+202D>  Such bitter tears for that which hath been spoke,
<U+202D>  Which, shunning soft show, see how he would cloak,
<U+202D>  And with his purple weed his weepings hide.
<U+202D>     Then Nestors son, Pisistratus, replied:
<U+202D>  Great pastor of the people, kept of God!
<U+202D>  He is Ulysses son, but his abode
<U+202D>  Not made before here, and he modest too,
<U+202D>  He holds it an indignity to do
<U+202D>  A deed so vain, to use the boast of words,
<U+202D>  Where your words are on wing; whose voice affords
<U+202D>  Delight to us as if a God did break
<U+202D>  The air amongst us, and vouchsafe to speak.
<U+202D>  But me my father, old duke Nestor, sent
<U+202D>  To be his consort hither; his content
<U+202D>  Not to be heightend so as with your sight,
<U+202D>  In hope that therewith words and actions might
<U+202D>  Inform his comforts from you, since he is
<U+202D>  Extremely grievd and injurd by the miss
<U+202D>  Of his great father; suffring evn at home,
<U+202D>  And few friends found to help him overcome
<U+202D>  His too weak suffrance, now his sire is gone;
<U+202D>  Amongst the people, not afforded one
<U+202D>  To check the miseries that mate him thus.
<U+202D>  And this the state is of Telemachus.
<U+202D>     O Gods,  said he,  how certain, now, I see
<U+202D>  My house enjoys that friends son, that for me
<U+202D>  Hath undergone so many willing fights!
<U+202D>  Whom I resolvd, past all the Grecian knights,
<U+202D>  To hold in love, if our return by seas
<U+202D>  The far-off Thunderer did ever please
<U+202D>  To grant our wishes.  And to his respect
<U+202D>  A palace and a city to erect,
<U+202D>  My vow had bound me; whither bringing then
<U+202D>  His riches, and his son, and all his men,
<U+202D>  From barren Ithaca, (some one sole town
<U+202D>  Inhabited about him batterd down)
<U+202D>  All should in Argos live.  And there would I
<U+202D>  Ease him of rule, and take the empery
<U+202D>  Of all on me.  And often here would we,
<U+202D>  Delighting, loving eithers company,
<U+202D>  Meet and converse; whom nothing should divide,
<U+202D>  Till deaths black veil did each all over hide.
<U+202D>  But this perhaps hath been a mean to take
<U+202D>  Evn God himself with envy; who did make
<U+202D>  Ulysses therefore only the unblest,
<U+202D>  That should not reach his loved countrys rest.
<U+202D>     These woes made evry one with woe in love;
<U+202D>  Evn Argive Helen wept, the Seed of Jove;
<U+202D>  Ulysses son wept; Atreus son did weep;
<U+202D>  And Nestors son his eyes in tears did steep,
<U+202D>  But his tears fell not from the present cloud
<U+202D>  That from Ulysses was exhald, but flowd
<U+202D>  From brave Antilochus rememberd due,
<U+202D>  Whom the renownd Son of the Morning slew,
<U+202D>  Which yet he thus excusd:  O Atreus son!
<U+202D>  Old Nestor says, there lives not such a one
<U+202D>  Amongst all mortals as Atrides is
<U+202D>  For deathless wisdom.  Tis a praise of his,
<U+202D>  Still givn in your remembrance, when at home
<U+202D>  Our speech concerns you.  Since then overcome
<U+202D>  You please to be with sorrow, evn to tears,
<U+202D>  That are in wisdom so exempt from peers,
<U+202D>  Vouchsafe the like effect in me excuse,
<U+202D>  If it be lawful, I affect no use
<U+202D>  Of tears thus after meals; at least, at night;
<U+202D>  But when the morn brings forth, with tears, her light,
<U+202D>  It shall not then impair me to bestow
<U+202D>  My tears on any worthys overthrow.
<U+202D>  It is the only rite that wretched men
<U+202D>  Can do dead friends, to cut hair, and complain.
<U+202D>  But Death my brother took, whom none could call
<U+202D>  The Grecian coward, you best knew of all.
<U+202D>  I was not there, nor saw, but men report
<U+202D>  Antilochus excelld the common sort
<U+202D>  For footmanship, or for the chariot race,
<U+202D>  Or in the fight for hardy hold of place.
<U+202D>     O friend,  said he,  since thou hast spoken so,
<U+202D>  At all parts as one wise should say and do,
<U+202D>  And like one far beyond thyself in years,
<U+202D>  Thy words shall bounds be to our former tears.
<U+202D>  O he is questionless a right-born son,
<U+202D>  That of his father hath not only won
<U+202D>  The person but the wisdom; and that sire
<U+202D>  Complete himself that hath a son entire,
<U+202D>  Jove did not only his full fate adorn,
<U+202D>  When he was wedded, but when he was born.
<U+202D>  As now Saturnius, through his lifes whole date,
<U+202D>  Hath Nestors bliss raisd to as steep a state,
<U+202D>  Both in his age to keep in peace his house,
<U+202D>  And to have children wise and valorous.
<U+202D>  But let us not forget our rear feast thus.
<U+202D>  Let some give water here.  Telemachus!
<U+202D>  The morning shall yield time to you and me
<U+202D>  To do what fits, and reason mutually.
<U+202D>     This said, the careful servant of the king,
<U+202D>  Asphalion, pourd on th issue of the spring;
<U+202D>  And all to ready feast set ready hand.
<U+202D>  But Helen now on new device did stand,
<U+202D>  Infusing straight a medicine to their wine,
<U+202D>  That, drowning care and angers; did decline
<U+202D>  All thought of ill.  Who drunk her cup could shed
<U+202D>  All that day not a tear, no not if dead
<U+202D>  That day his father or his mother were,
<U+202D>  Not if his brother, child, or chiefest dear,
<U+202D>  He should see murderd then before his face.
<U+202D>  Such useful medicines, only borne in grace
<U+202D>  Of what was good, would Helen ever have.
<U+202D>  And this juice to her Polydamna gave
<U+202D>  The wife of Thoon, an Agyptian born,
<U+202D>  Whose rich earth herbs of medicine do adorn
<U+202D>  In great abundance.  Many healthful are,
<U+202D>  And many baneful.  Evry man is there
<U+202D>  A good physician out of Natures grace,
<U+202D>  For all the nation sprung of Paons race.
<U+202D>     When Helen then her medicine had infusd,
<U+202D>  She bad pour wine to it, and this speech usd:
<U+202D>     Atrides, and these good mens sons, great Jove
<U+202D>  Makes good and ill one after other move,
<U+202D>  In all things earthly; for he can do all.
<U+202D>  The woes past, therefore, he so late let fall,
<U+202D>  The comforts he affords us let us take;
<U+202D>  Feast, and, with fit discourses, merry make.
<U+202D>  Nor will I other use.  As then our blood
<U+202D>  Grievd for Ulysses, since he was so good,
<U+202D>  Since he was good, let us delight to hear
<U+202D>  How good he was, and what his suffrings were;
<U+202D>  Though evry fight, and evry suffring deed,
<U+202D>  Patient Ulysses underwent, exceed
<U+202D>  My womans powr to number, or to name.
<U+202D>  But what he did, and sufferd, when he came
<U+202D>  Amongst the Trojans, where ye Grecians all
<U+202D>  Took part with suffrance, I in part can call
<U+202D>  To your kind memories.  How with ghastly wounds
<U+202D>  Himself he mangled, and the Trojan bounds,
<U+202D>  Thrust thick with enemies, adventurd on,
<U+202D>  His royal shoulders having cast upon
<U+202D>  Base abject weeds, and enterd like a slave.
<U+202D>  Then, beggar-like, he did of all men crave,
<U+202D>  And such a wretch was, as the whole Greek fleet
<U+202D>  Brought not besides.  And thus through evry street
<U+202D>  He crept discovring, of no one man known.
<U+202D>  And yet through all this diffrence, I alone
<U+202D>  Smoked his true person, talkd with him; but he
<U+202D>  Fled me with wiles still.  Nor could we agree,
<U+202D>  Till I disclaimd him quite; and so (as movd
<U+202D>  With womanly remorse of one that provd
<U+202D>  So wretched an estate, whateer he were)
<U+202D>  Won him to take my house.  And yet evn there,
<U+202D>  Till freely I, to make him doubtless, swore
<U+202D>  A powrful oath, to let him reach the shore
<U+202D>  Of ships and tents before Troy understood,
<U+202D>  I could not force on him his proper good.
<U+202D>  But then I bathd and soothd him, and he then
<U+202D>  Confessd, and told me all; and, having slain
<U+202D>  A number of the Trojan guards, retird,
<U+202D>  And reachd the fleet, for sleight and force admird.
<U+202D>  Their husbands deaths by him the Trojan wives
<U+202D>  Shriekd for; but I made triumphs for their lives,
<U+202D>  For then my heart conceivd, that once again
<U+202D>  I should reach home; and yet did still retain
<U+202D>  Woe for the slaughters Venus made for me,
<U+202D>  When both my husband, my Hermione,
<U+202D>  And bridal room, she robbd of so much right,
<U+202D>  And drew me from my country with her sleight,
<U+202D>  Though nothing under heaven I here did need,
<U+202D>  That could my fancy or my beauty feed.
<U+202D>     Her husband said:  Wife!  what you please to tell
<U+202D>  Is true at all parts, and becomes you well;
<U+202D>  And I myself, that now may say have seen
<U+202D>  The minds and manners of a world of men,
<U+202D>  And great heroes, measuring many a ground,
<U+202D>  Have never, by these eyes that light me, found
<U+202D>  One with a bosom so to be belovd,
<U+202D>  As that in which th accomplishd spirit movd
<U+202D>  Of patient Ulysses.  What, brave man,
<U+202D>  He both did act, and suffer, when he wan
<U+202D>  The town of Ilion, in the brave-built horse,
<U+202D>  When all we chief states of the Grecian force
<U+202D>  Were housd together, bringing death and Fate
<U+202D>  Amongst the Trojans, you, wife, may relate;
<U+202D>  For you, at last, came to us; God, that would
<U+202D>  The Trojans glory give, gave charge you should
<U+202D>  Approach the engine; and Deiphobus,
<U+202D>  The god-like, followd.  Thrice ye circled us
<U+202D>  With full survey of it; and often tried
<U+202D>  The hollow crafts that in it were implied.  [4]
<U+202D>  When all the voices of their wives in it
<U+202D>  You took on you with voice so like and fit,
<U+202D>  And evry man by name so visited,
<U+202D>  That I, Ulysses, the king Diomed,
<U+202D>  (Set in the midst, and hearing how you calld)
<U+202D>  Tydides, and myself (as half appalld
<U+202D>  With your remorseful plaints) would passing fain
<U+202D>  Have broke our silence, rather than again
<U+202D>  Endure, respectless, their so moving cries.
<U+202D>  But Ithacus our strongest phantasies
<U+202D>  Containd within us from the slenderest noise,
<U+202D>  And evry man there sat without a voice.
<U+202D>  Anticlus only would have answerd thee,
<U+202D>  But his speech Ithacus incessantly
<U+202D>  With strong hand held in, till, Minervas call
<U+202D>  Charging thee off, Ulysses savd us all.
<U+202D>     Telemachus replied:  Much greater is
<U+202D>  My grief, for hearing this high praise of his.
<U+202D>  For all this doth not his sad death divert,
<U+202D>  Nor can, though in him swelld an iron heart.
<U+202D>  Prepare, and lead then, if you please, to rest:
<U+202D>  Sleep, that we hear not, will content us best.
<U+202D>     Then Argive Helen made her handmaid go,
<U+202D>  And put fair bedding in the portico,
<U+202D>  Lay purple blankets on, rugs warm and soft,
<U+202D>  And cast an arras coverlet aloft.
<U+202D>     They torches took, made haste, and made the bed;
<U+202D>  When both the guests were to their lodgings led
<U+202D>  Within a portico without the house.
<U+202D>  Atrides, and his large-train-wearing spouse,
<U+202D>  The excellent of women, for the way,
<U+202D>  In a retird receit, together lay.
<U+202D>  The Morn arose; the king rose, and put on
<U+202D>  His royal weeds, his sharp sword hung upon
<U+202D>  His ample shoulders, forth his chamber went,
<U+202D>  And did the person of a God present.
<U+202D>     Telemachus accosts him, who begun
<U+202D>  Speech of his journeys proposition:
<U+202D>     And what, my young Ulyssean heroë,
<U+202D>  Provokd thee on the broad back of the sea,
<U+202D>  To visit Lacedamon the divine?
<U+202D>  Speak truth, some public [good] or only thine?
<U+202D>     I come,  said he,  to hear, if any fame
<U+202D>  Breathd of my father to thy notice came.
<U+202D>  My house is sackd, my fat works of the field
<U+202D>  Are all destroyd; my house doth nothing yield
<U+202D>  But enemies, that kill my harmless sheep,
<U+202D>  And sinewy oxen, nor will ever keep
<U+202D>  Their steels without them.  And these men are they
<U+202D>  That woo my mother, most inhumanly
<U+202D>  Committing injury on injury.
<U+202D>  To thy knees therefore I am come, t attend
<U+202D>  Relation of the sad and wretched end
<U+202D>  My erring father felt, if witnessd by
<U+202D>  Your own eyes, or the certain news that fly
<U+202D>  From others knowledges.  For, more than is
<U+202D>  The usual heap of human miseries,
<U+202D>  His mother bore him to.  Vouchsafe me then,
<U+202D>  Without all ruth of what I can sustain,
<U+202D>  The plain and simple truth of all you know.
<U+202D>  Let me beseech so much, if ever vow
<U+202D>  Was made, and put in good effect to you,
<U+202D>  At Troy, where suffrance bred you so much smart,
<U+202D>  Upon my father good Ulysses part,
<U+202D>  And quit it now to me (himself in youth)
<U+202D>  Unfolding only the uncloséd truth.
<U+202D>     He, deeply sighing, answerd him:  O shame,
<U+202D>  That such poor vassals should affect the fame
<U+202D>  To share the joys of such a worthys bed!
<U+202D>  As when a hind, her calves late farrowéd,
<U+202D>  To give suck, enters the bold lions den,
<U+202D>  He roots of hills and herby vallies then
<U+202D>  For food (there feeding) hunting; but at length
<U+202D>  Returning to his cavern, gives his strength
<U+202D>  The lives of both the mother and her brood
<U+202D>  In deaths indecent; so the Wooers blood
<U+202D>  Must pay Ulysses powrs as sharp an end.
<U+202D>  O would to Jove, Apollo, and thy friend
<U+202D>  The wise Minerva, that thy father were
<U+202D>  As once he was, when he his spirits did rear
<U+202D>  Against Philomelides, in a fight
<U+202D>  Performd in well-built Lesbos, where, down-right
<U+202D>  He strook the earth with him, and gat a shout
<U+202D>  Of all the Grecians!  O, if now full out
<U+202D>  He were as then, and with the Wooers coped,
<U+202D>  Short-livd they all were, and their nuptials hoped
<U+202D>  Would prove as desprate.  But, for thy demand
<U+202D>  Enforcd with prayrs, Ill let thee understand
<U+202D>  The truth directly, nor decline a thought,
<U+202D>  Much less deceive, or sooth thy search in ought;
<U+202D>  But what the old and still-true-spoken God,
<U+202D>  That from the sea breathes oracles abroad,
<U+202D>  Disclosd to me, to thee Ill all impart,
<U+202D>  Nor hide one word from thy sollicitous heart.
<U+202D>      I was in Agypt, where a mighty time
<U+202D>  The Gods detaind me, though my natural clime
<U+202D>  I never so desird, because their homes
<U+202D>  I did not greet with perfect hecatombs.
<U+202D>  For they will put men evermore in mind,
<U+202D>  How much their masterly commandments bind.
<U+202D>     There is, besides, a certain island, calld
<U+202D>  Pharos, that with the high-wavd sea is walld,
<U+202D>  Just against Agypt, and so much remote,
<U+202D>  As in a whole day, with a fore-gale smote,
<U+202D>  A hollow ship can sail.  And this isle bears
<U+202D>  A port most portly, where sea-passengers
<U+202D>  Put in still for fresh water, and away
<U+202D>  To sea again.  Yet here the Gods did stay
<U+202D>  My fleet full twenty days; the winds, that are
<U+202D>  Masters at sea, no prosprous puff would spare
<U+202D>  To put us off; and all my victuals here
<U+202D>  Had quite corrupted, as my mens minds were,
<U+202D>  Had not a certain Goddess givn regard,
<U+202D>  And pitied me in an estate so hard;
<U+202D>  And twas Idothea, honourd Proteus seed,
<U+202D>  That old sea-farer.  Her mind I make bleed
<U+202D>  With my compassion, when (walkd all alone,
<U+202D>  From all my soldiers, that were ever gone
<U+202D>  About the isle on fishing with hooks bent;
<U+202D>  Hunger their bellies on her errand sent)
<U+202D>  She came close to me, spake, and thus began:
<U+202D>     Of all men thou art the most foolish man!
<U+202D>  Or slack in business, or stayst here of choice,
<U+202D>  And dost in all thy suffrances rejoice,
<U+202D>  That thus long livst detaind here, and no end
<U+202D>  Canst give thy tarriance?  Thou dost much offend
<U+202D>  The minds of all thy fellows.  I replied:
<U+202D>     Whoever thou art of the Deified,
<U+202D>  I must affirm, that no way with my will
<U+202D>  I make abode here; but, it seems, some ill
<U+202D>  The Gods, inhabiting broad heavn, sustain
<U+202D>  Against my getting off.  Inform me then,
<U+202D>  For Godheads all things know, what God is he
<U+202D>  That stays my passage from the fishy sea?
<U+202D>     Stranger, said she, Ill tell thee true: There lives
<U+202D>  An old sea-farer in these seas, that gives
<U+202D>  A true solution of all secrets here,
<U+202D>  Who deathless Proteus is, th Agyptian peer,
<U+202D>  Who can the deeps of all the seas exquire,
<U+202D>  Who Neptunes priest is, and, they say, the sire
<U+202D>  That did beget me.  Him, if any way
<U+202D>  Thou couldst inveigle, he would clear display
<U+202D>  Thy course from hence, and how far off doth lie
<U+202D>  Thy voyages whole scope through Neptunes sky.
<U+202D>  Informing thee, O God-preservd, beside,
<U+202D>  If thy desires would so be satisfied,
<U+202D>  Whatever good or ill hath got event,
<U+202D>  In all the time thy long and hard course spent,
<U+202D>  Since thy departure from thy house.  This said;
<U+202D>  Again I answerd:  Make the sleights displayd
<U+202D>  Thy father useth, lest his foresight see,
<U+202D>  Or his foreknowledge taking note of me,
<U+202D>  He flies the fixt place of his usd abode.
<U+202D>  Tis hard for man to countermine with God.
<U+202D>     She straight replied: Ill utter truth in all:
<U+202D>  When heavns supremest height the sun doth skall,
<U+202D>  The old Sea-tell-truth leaves the deeps, and hides
<U+202D>  Amidst a black storm, when the West Wind chides,
<U+202D>  In caves still sleeping.  Round about him sleep
<U+202D>  (With short feet swimming forth the foamy deep)
<U+202D>  The sea-calves, lovely Halosydnes calld,
<U+202D>  From whom a noisome odour is exhald,
<U+202D>  Got from the whirl-pools, on whose earth they lie.
<U+202D>  Here, when the morn illustrates all the sky,
<U+202D>  Ill guide, and seat thee in the fittest place
<U+202D>  For the performance thou hast now in chace.
<U+202D>  In mean time, reach thy fleet, and choose out three
<U+202D>  Of best exploit, to go as aids to thee.
<U+202D>     But now Ill show thee all the old Gods sleights:
<U+202D>  He first will number, and take all the sights
<U+202D>  Of those his guard, that on the shore arrives.
<U+202D>  When having viewd, and told them forth by fives,
<U+202D>  He takes place in their midst, and there doth sleep,
<U+202D>  Like to a shepherd midst his flock of sheep.
<U+202D>  In his first sleep, call up your hardiest cheer,
<U+202D>  Vigour and violence, and hold him there,
<U+202D>  In spite of all his strivings to be gone.
<U+202D>  He then will turn himself to evry one
<U+202D>  Of all things that in earth creep and respire,
<U+202D>  In water swim, or shine in heavnly fire.
<U+202D>  Yet still hold you him firm, and much the more
<U+202D>  Press him from passing.  But when, as before,
<U+202D>  When sleep first bound his powrs, his form ye see,
<U+202D>  Then cease your force, and th old heroë free,
<U+202D>  And then demand, which heavn-born it may be
<U+202D>  That so afflicts you, hindring your retreat,
<U+202D>  And free sea-passage to your native seat.
<U+202D>     This said, she divd into the wavy seas,
<U+202D>  And I my course did to my ships address,
<U+202D>  That on the sands stuck; where arrivd, we made
<U+202D>  Our supper ready.  Then th ambrosian shade
<U+202D>  Of night fell on us, and to sleep we fell.
<U+202D>  Rosy Aurora rose; we rose as well,
<U+202D>  And three of them on whom I most relied,
<U+202D>  For firm at evry force, I choosd, and hied
<U+202D>  Straight to the many-river-servéd seas;
<U+202D>  And all assistance askd the Deities.
<U+202D>     Mean time Idothea the seas broad breast
<U+202D>  Embracd, and brought for me, and all my rest,
<U+202D>  Four of the sea-calves skins but newly flayd,
<U+202D>  To work a wile which she had fashionéd
<U+202D>  Upon her father.  Then, within the sand
<U+202D>  A covert digging, when these calves should land,
<U+202D>  She sat expecting.  We came close to her;
<U+202D>  She placd us orderly, and made us wear
<U+202D>  Each one his calfs skin.  But we then must pass
<U+202D>  A huge exploit.  The sea-calves savour was
<U+202D>  So passing sour, they still being bred at seas,
<U+202D>  It much afflicted us; for who can please
<U+202D>  To lie by one of these same sea-bred whales?
<U+202D>  But she preserves us, and to memory calls
<U+202D>  A rare commodity; she fetchd to us
<U+202D>  Ambrosia, that an air most odorous
<U+202D>  Bears still about it, which she nointed round
<U+202D>  Our either nosthrils, and in it quite drownd
<U+202D>  The nasty whale-smell.  Then the great event
<U+202D>  The whole morns date, with spirits patient,
<U+202D>  We lay expecting.  When bright noon did flame,
<U+202D>  Forth from the sea in shoals the sea-calves came,
<U+202D>  And orderly, at last lay down and slept
<U+202D>  Along the sands.  And then th old Sea-God crept
<U+202D>  From forth the deeps, and found his fat calves there,
<U+202D>  Surveyd, and numberd, and came never near
<U+202D>  The craft we usd, but told us five for calves.
<U+202D>  His temples then dis-easd with sleep he salves;
<U+202D>  And in rushd we, with an abhorréd cry,
<U+202D>  Cast all our hands about him manfully;
<U+202D>  And then th old Forger all his forms began:
<U+202D>  First was a lion with a mighty mane,
<U+202D>  Then next a dragon, a pied panther then,
<U+202D>  A vast boar next, and suddenly did strain
<U+202D>  All into water.  Last he was a tree,
<U+202D>  Curld all at top, and shot up to the sky.
<U+202D>     We, with resolvd hearts, held him firmly still,
<U+202D>  When th old one (held too strait for all his skill
<U+202D>  To extricate) gave words, and questiond me:
<U+202D>     Which of the Gods, O Atreus son, said he,
<U+202D>  Advisd and taught thy fortitude this sleight,
<U+202D>  To take and hold me thus in my despite?
<U+202D>  What asks thy wish now? I replied.  'Thou knowst.
<U+202D>  Why dost thou ask?  What wiles are these thou showst?
<U+202D>  I have within this isle been held for wind
<U+202D>  A wondrous time, and can by no means find
<U+202D>  An end to my retention.  It hath spent
<U+202D>  The very heart in me.  Give thou then vent
<U+202D>  To doubts thus bound in me, ye Gods know all,
<U+202D>  Which of the Godheads doth so foully fall
<U+202D>  On my addression home, to stay me here,
<U+202D>  Avert me from my way, the fishy clear
<U+202D>  Barrd to my passage?  He replied:  Of force,
<U+202D>  If to thy home thou wishest free recourse,
<U+202D>  To Jove, and all the other Deities,
<U+202D>  Thou must exhibit solemn sacrifice;
<U+202D>  And then the black sea for thee shall be clear,
<U+202D>  Till thy lovd countrys settled reach.  But where
<U+202D>  Ask these rites thy performance?  Tis a fate
<U+202D>  To thee and thy affairs appropriate,
<U+202D>  That thou shalt never see thy friends, nor tread
<U+202D>  Thy countrys earth, nor see inhabited
<U+202D>  Thy so magnificent house, till thou make good
<U+202D>  Thy voyage back to the Agyptian flood,
<U+202D>  Whose waters fell from Jove, and there hast givn
<U+202D>  To Jove, and all Gods housed in ample heavn,
<U+202D>  Devoted hecatombs, and then free ways
<U+202D>  Shall open to thee, cleard of all delays.
<U+202D>     This told he; and, methought, he brake my heart,
<U+202D>  In such a long and hard course to divert
<U+202D>  My hope for home, and charge my back retreat
<U+202D>  As far as Agypt.  I made answer yet:
<U+202D>     Father, thy charge Ill perfect; but before
<U+202D>  Resolve me truly, if their natural shore
<U+202D>  All those Greeks, and their ships, do safe enjoy,
<U+202D>  That Nestor and myself left, when from Troy
<U+202D>  We first raisd sail?  Or whether any died
<U+202D>  At sea a death unwishd?  Or, satisfied,
<U+202D>  When war was past, by friends embracd, in peace
<U+202D>  Resignd their spirits?  He made answer: Cease
<U+202D>  To ask so far.  It fits thee not to be
<U+202D>  So cunning in thine own calamity.
<U+202D>  Nor seek to learn what learnd thou shouldst forget.
<U+202D>  Mens knowledges have proper limits set,
<U+202D>  And should not prease into the mind of God.
<U+202D>  But twill not long be, as my thoughts abode,
<U+202D>  Before thou buy this curious skill with tears.
<U+202D>  Many of those, whose states so tempt thine ears,
<U+202D>  Are stoopd by death, and many left alive,
<U+202D>  One chief of which in strong hold doth survive,
<U+202D>  Amidst the broad sea.  Two, in their retreat,
<U+202D>  Are done to death.  I list not to repeat
<U+202D>  Who fell at Troy, thyself was there in fight,
<U+202D>  But in return swift Ajax lost the light,
<U+202D>  In his long-oard ship.  Neptune, yet, awhile
<U+202D>  Saft him unwrackd, to the Gyraan isle,
<U+202D>  A mighty-rock removing from his way.
<U+202D>  And surely he had scapd the fatal day,
<U+202D>  In spite of Pallas, if to that foul deed
<U+202D>  He in her fane did, (when he ravishéd
<U+202D>  The Trojan prophetess) he had not here
<U+202D>  Adjoind an impious boast, that he would bear,
<U+202D>  Despite the Gods, his ship safe through the waves
<U+202D>  Then raisd against him.  These his impious braves
<U+202D>  When Neptune heard, in his strong hand he took
<U+202D>  His massy trident, and so soundly strook
<U+202D>  The rock Gyraan, that in two it cleft;
<U+202D>  Of which one fragment on the land he left,
<U+202D>  The other fell into the troubled seas;
<U+202D>  At which first rushd Ajax Oiliades,
<U+202D>  And split his ship, and then himself afloat
<U+202D>  Swum on the rough waves of the worlds vast mote,
<U+202D>  Till having drunk a salt cup for his sin,
<U+202D>  There perishd he.  Thy brother yet did win
<U+202D>  The wreath from death, while in the waves they strove,
<U+202D>  Afflicted by the revrend wife of Jove.
<U+202D>  But when the steep mount of the Malian shore
<U+202D>  He seemd to reach, a most tempestuous blore,
<U+202D>  Far to the fishy world that sighs so sore,
<U+202D>  Straight ravishd him again as far away,
<U+202D>  As to th extreme bounds where the Agrians stay,
<U+202D>  Where first Thyestes dwelt, but then his son
<U+202D>  Agisthus Thyestiades livd.  This done,
<U+202D>  When his return untouchd appeard again,
<U+202D>  Back turnd the Gods the wind, and set him then
<U+202D>  Hard by his house.  Then, full of joy, he left
<U+202D>  His ship, and close t his country earth he cleft,
<U+202D>  Kissd it, and wept for joy, pourd tear on tear,
<U+202D>  To set so wishedly his footing there.
<U+202D>  But see, a sentinel that all the year
<U+202D>  Crafty Agisthus in a watchtowr set
<U+202D>  To spy his landing, for reward as great
<U+202D>  As two gold talents, all his powrs did call
<U+202D>  To strict remembrance of his charge, and all
<U+202D>  Dischargd at first sight, which at first he cast
<U+202D>  On Agamemnon, and with all his haste
<U+202D>  Informd Agisthus.  He an instant train
<U+202D>  Laid for his slaughter: Twenty chosen men
<U+202D>  Of his plebeians he in ambush laid;
<U+202D>  His other men he chargd to see purveyd
<U+202D>  A feast; and forth, with horse and chariots gracd,
<U+202D>  He rode t invite him, but in heart embracd
<U+202D>  Horrible welcomes, and to death did bring,
<U+202D>  With treachrous slaughter, the unwary king,
<U+202D>  Receivd him at a feast, and, like an ox
<U+202D>  Slain at his manger, gave him bits and knocks.
<U+202D>  No one left of Atrides train, nor one
<U+202D>  Savd to Agisthus, but himself alone,
<U+202D>  All strewd together there the bloody court.
<U+202D>  This said, my soul he sunk with his report,
<U+202D>  Flat on the sands I fell, tears spent their store,
<U+202D>  I light abhorrd, my heart would live no more.
<U+202D>     When dry of tears, and tird of tumbling there,
<U+202D>  Th old Tell-truth thus my daunted spirits did cheer:
<U+202D>     No more spend tears nor time, O Atreus son,
<U+202D>  With ceaseless weeping never wish was won,
<U+202D>  Use uttermost assay to reach thy home,
<U+202D>  And all unwares upon the murderer come,
<U+202D>  For torture, taking him thyself alive;
<U+202D>  Or let Orestes, that should far out-strive
<U+202D>  Thee in fit vengeance, quickly quit the light
<U+202D>  Of such a dark soul, and do thou the rite
<U+202D>  Of burial to him with a funeral feast.
<U+202D>     With these last words I fortified my breast,
<U+202D>  In which again a genrous spring began
<U+202D>  Of fitting comfort, as I was a man;
<U+202D>  But, as a brother, I must ever mourn.
<U+202D>  Yet forth I went, and told him the return
<U+202D>  Of these I knew; but he had namd a third,
<U+202D>  Held on the broad sea, still with life inspird,
<U+202D>  Whom I besought to know, though likewise dead,
<U+202D>  And I must mourn alike.  He answeréd:
<U+202D>     He is Laertes son; whom I beheld
<U+202D>  In nymph Calypsos palace, who compelld
<U+202D>  His stay with her, and, since he could not see
<U+202D>  His country earth, he mournd incessantly.
<U+202D>  For he had neither ship instruct with oars,
<U+202D>  Nor men to fetch him from those stranger shores.
<U+202D>  Where leave we him, and to thy self descend,
<U+202D>  Whom not in Argos Fate nor Death shall end,
<U+202D>  But the immortal ends of all the earth,
<U+202D>  So ruld by them that order death by birth,
<U+202D>  The fields Elysian, Fate to thee will give;
<U+202D>  Where Rhadamanthus rules, and where men live
<U+202D>  A never-troubled life, where snow, nor showrs,
<U+202D>  Nor irksome Winter spends his fruitless powrs,
<U+202D>  But from the ocean Zephyr still resumes
<U+202D>  A constant breath, that all the fields perfumes.
<U+202D>  Which, since thou marriedst Helen, are thy hire,
<U+202D>  And Jove himself is by her side thy sire.
<U+202D>     This said; he divd the deepsome watry heaps;
<U+202D>  I and my tried men took us to our ships,
<U+202D>  And worlds of thoughts I varied with my steps.
<U+202D>     Arrivd and shippd, the silent solemn night
<U+202D>  And sleep bereft us of our visual light.
<U+202D>  At morn, masts, sails, reard, we sat, left the shores,
<U+202D>  And beat the foamy ocean with our oars.
<U+202D>     Again then we the Jove-falln flood did fetch,
<U+202D>  As far as Agypt; where we did beseech
<U+202D>  The Gods with hecatombs; whose angers ceast,
<U+202D>  I tombd my brother that I might be blest.
<U+202D>     All rites performd, all haste I made for home,
<U+202D>  And all the prosprous winds about were come,
<U+202D>  I had the passport now of evry God,
<U+202D>  And here closd all these labours period.
<U+202D>     Here stay then till th eleventh or twelfth days light,
<U+202D>  And Ill dismiss thee well, gifts exquisite
<U+202D>  Preparing for thee, chariot, horses three,
<U+202D>  A cup of curious frame to serve for thee
<U+202D>  To serve th immortal Gods with sacrifice,
<U+202D>  Mindful of me while all suns light thy skies.
<U+202D>     He answerd:  Stay me not too long time here,
<U+202D>  Though I could sit attending all the year.
<U+202D>  Nor should my house, nor parents, with desire,
<U+202D>  Take my affections from you, so on fire
<U+202D>  With love to hear you are my thoughts; but so
<U+202D>  My Pylian friends I shall afflict with woe
<U+202D>  Who mourn evn this stay.  Whatsoever be
<U+202D>  The gifts your grace is to bestow on me,
<U+202D>  Vouchsafe them such as I may bear and save
<U+202D>  For your sake ever.  Horse, I list not have,
<U+202D>  To keep in Ithaca, but leave them here,
<U+202D>  To your soils dainties, where the broad fields bear
<U+202D>  Sweet cypers grass, where men-fed lote doth flow,
<U+202D>  Where wheat-like spelt, and wheat itself, doth grow,
<U+202D>  Where barley, white, and spreading like a tree;
<U+202D>  But Ithaca hath neither ground to be,
<U+202D>  For any length it comprehends, a race
<U+202D>  To try a horses speed, nor any place
<U+202D>  To make him fat in; fitter far to feed
<U+202D>  A cliff-bred goat, than raise or please a steed.
<U+202D>  Of all isles, Ithaca doth least provide
<U+202D>  Or meads to feed a horse, or ways to ride.
<U+202D>     He, smiling, said:  Of good blood art thou, son.
<U+202D>  What speech, so young!  What observatión
<U+202D>  Hast thou made of the world!  I well am pleasd
<U+202D>  To change my gifts to thee, as being confessd
<U+202D>  Unfit indeed, my store is such I may.
<U+202D>  Of all my house-gifts then, that up I lay
<U+202D>  For treasure there, I will bestow on thee
<U+202D>  The fairest, and of greatest price to me.
<U+202D>  I will bestow on thee a rich carvd cup,
<U+202D>  Of silver all, but all the brims wrought up
<U+202D>  With finest gold; it was the only thing
<U+202D>  That the heroical Sidonian king
<U+202D>  Presented to me, when we were to part
<U+202D>  At his receipt of me, and twas the art
<U+202D>  Of that great Artist that of heavn is free;
<U+202D>  And yet evn this will I bestow on thee.
<U+202D>     This speech thus ended, guests came, and did bring
<U+202D>  Muttons, for presents, to the God-like king,
<U+202D>  And spirit-prompting wine, that strenuous makes.
<U+202D>  Their riband-wreathed wives brought fruit and cakes.
<U+202D>     Thus in this house did these their feast apply;
<U+202D>  And in Ulysses house activity
<U+202D>  The Wooers practisd; tossing of the spear,
<U+202D>  The stone, and hurling; thus delighted, where
<U+202D>  They exercisd such insolence before,
<U+202D>  Evn in the court that wealthy pavements wore
<U+202D>  Antinous did still their strifes decide,
<U+202D>  And he that was in person deified
<U+202D>  Eurymachus; both ring-leaders of all,
<U+202D>  For in their virtues they were principal.
<U+202D>     These by Noëmon, son to Phronius,
<U+202D>  Were sided now, who made the question thus:
<U+202D>     Antinous!  Does any friend here know,
<U+202D>  When this Telemachus returns, or no,
<U+202D>  From sandy Pylos?  He made bold to take
<U+202D>  My ship with him; of which, I now should make
<U+202D>  Fit use myself, and sail in her as far
<U+202D>  As spacious Elis, where of mine there are
<U+202D>  Twelve delicate mares, and under their sides go
<U+202D>  Laborious mules, that yet did never know
<U+202D>  The yoke, nor labour; some of which should bear
<U+202D>  The taming now, if I could fetch them there.
<U+202D>  This speech the rest admird, nor dreamd that he
<U+202D>  Neleian Pylos ever thought to see,
<U+202D>  But was at field about his flocks survey,
<U+202D>  Or thought his herdsmen held him so away.
<U+202D>  Eupitheus son, Antinous, then replied:
<U+202D>  When went he, or with what train dignified?
<U+202D>  Of his selected Ithacensian youth?
<U+202D>  Prest men, or bond men, were they?  Tell the truth.
<U+202D>  Could he effect this?  Let me truly know.
<U+202D>  To gain thy vessel did he violence show,
<U+202D>  And usd her gainst thy will?  or had her free,
<U+202D>  When fitting question he had made with thee?
<U+202D>     Noëmon answerd:  I did freely give
<U+202D>  My vessel to him.  Who deserves to live
<U+202D>  That would do other, when such men as he
<U+202D>  Did in distress ask?  He should churlish be
<U+202D>  That would deny him.  Of our youth the best
<U+202D>  Amongst the people, to the interest
<U+202D>  His charge did challenge in them, giving way,
<U+202D>  With all the tribute all their powrs could pay.
<U+202D>  Their captain, as he took the ship, I knew,
<U+202D>  Who Mentor was, or God.  A Deitys shew
<U+202D>  Maskd in his likeness.  But, to think twas he,
<U+202D>  I much admire, for I did clearly see,
<U+202D>  But yester-morning, God-like Mentor here;
<U+202D>  Yet th other evning he took shipping there,
<U+202D>  And went for Pylos.  Thus went he for home,
<U+202D>  And left the rest with envy overcome;
<U+202D>  Who sat, and pastime left.  Eupitheus son,
<U+202D>  Sad, and with rage his entrails overrun,
<U+202D>  His eyes like flames, thus interposd his speech:
<U+202D>  Strange thing!  An action of how proud a reach
<U+202D>  Is here committed by Telemachus!
<U+202D>  A boy, a child, and we, a sort of us,
<U+202D>  Vowd gainst his voyage, yet admit it thus!
<U+202D>  With ship and choice youth of our people too!
<U+202D>  But let him on, and all his mischief do,
<U+202D>  Jove shall convert upon himself his powrs,
<U+202D>  Before their ill presumd he brings on ours.
<U+202D>  Provide me then a ship, and twenty men
<U+202D>  To give her manage, that, against again
<U+202D>  He turns for home, on th Ithacensian seas,
<U+202D>  Or cliffy Samian, I may interprease,
<U+202D>  Way-lay, and take him, and make all his craft
<U+202D>  Sail with his ruin for his father saft.
<U+202D>     This all applauded, and gave charge to do,
<U+202D>  Rose, and to greet Ulysses house did go.
<U+202D>  But long time past not, ere Penelope
<U+202D>  Had notice of their far-fetchd treachery.
<U+202D>  Medon the herald told her, who had heard
<U+202D>  Without the hall how they within conferrd,
<U+202D>  And hasted straight to tell it to the queen,
<U+202D>  Who, from the entry having Medon seen,
<U+202D>  Prevents him thus:  Now herald, what affair
<U+202D>  Intend the famous Wooers, in your repair?
<U+202D>  To tell Ulysses maids that they must cease
<U+202D>  From doing our work, and their banquets dress?
<U+202D>  I would to heavn, that, leaving wooing me,
<U+202D>  Nor ever troubling other company,
<U+202D>  Here might the last feast be, and most extreme,
<U+202D>  That ever any shall address for them.
<U+202D>  They never meet but to consent in spoil,
<U+202D>  And reap the free fruits of anothers toil.
<U+202D>  O did they never, when they children were,
<U+202D>  What to their fathers was Ulysses, hear?
<U+202D>  Who never did gainst anyone proceed
<U+202D>  With unjust usage, or in word or deed?
<U+202D>  Tis yet with other kings another right,
<U+202D>  One to pursue with love, another spite;
<U+202D>  He still yet just, nor would, though might, devour,
<U+202D>  Nor to the worst did ever taste of powr.
<U+202D>  But their unruld acts show their minds estate.
<U+202D>  Good turns receivd once, thanks grow out of date.
<U+202D>     Medon, the learnd in wisdom, answerd her:
<U+202D>  I wish, O queen, that their ingratitudes were
<U+202D>  Their worst ill towards you; but worse by far,
<U+202D>  And much more deadly, their endeavours are,
<U+202D>  Which Jove will fail them in.  Telemachus
<U+202D>  Their purpose is, as he returns to us,
<U+202D>  To give their sharp steels in a cruel death;
<U+202D>  Who now is gone to learn, if fame can breathe
<U+202D>  News of his sire, and will the Pylian shore,
<U+202D>  And sacred Sparta, in his search explore.
<U+202D>     This news dissolvd to her both knees and heart,
<U+202D>  Long silence held her ere one word would part,
<U+202D>  Her eyes stood full of tears, her small soft voice
<U+202D>  All late use lost; that yet at last had choice
<U+202D>  Of wonted words, which briefly thus she usd:
<U+202D>     Why left my son his mother?  Why refusd
<U+202D>  His wit the solid shore, to try the seas,
<U+202D>  And put in ships the trust of his distress,
<U+202D>  That are at sea to men unbridled horse,
<U+202D>  And run, past rule, their far-engagéd course,
<U+202D>  Amidst a moisture past all mean unstaid?
<U+202D>  No need compelld this.  Did he it, afraid
<U+202D>  To live and leave posterity his name?
<U+202D>     I know not,  he replied,  if th humour came
<U+202D>  From current of his own instinct, or flowd
<U+202D>  From others instigations; but he vowd
<U+202D>  Attempt to Pylos, or to see descried
<U+202D>  His sires return, or know what death he died.
<U+202D>     This said, he took him to Ulysses house
<U+202D>  After the Wooers; the Ulyssean spouse,
<U+202D>  Run through with woes, let Torture seize her mind,
<U+202D>  Nor in her choice of state chairs stood inclind
<U+202D>  To take her seat, but th abject threshold chose
<U+202D>  Of her fair chamber for her loathd repose,
<U+202D>  And mournd most wretch-like.  Round about her fell
<U+202D>  Her handmaids, joind in a continuate yell.
<U+202D>  From evry corner of the palace, all
<U+202D>  Of all degrees tund to her comforts fall
<U+202D>  Their own dejections; to whom her complaint
<U+202D>  She thus enforcd:  The Gods, beyond constraint
<U+202D>  Of any measure, urge these tears on me;
<U+202D>  Nor was there ever dame of my degree
<U+202D>  So past degree grievd.  First, a lord so good,
<U+202D>  That had such hardy spirits in his blood,
<U+202D>  That all the virtues was adornd withall,
<U+202D>  That all the Greeks did their superior call,
<U+202D>  To part with thus, and lose!  And now a son,
<U+202D>  So worthily belovd, a course to run
<U+202D>  Beyond my knowledge; whom rude tempests have
<U+202D>  Made far from home his most inglorious grave!
<U+202D>  Unhappy wenches, that no one of all
<U+202D>  (Though in the reach of evry one must fall
<U+202D>  His taking ship) sustaind the careful mind,
<U+202D>  To call me from my bed, who this designd
<U+202D>  And most vowd course in him had either stayd,
<U+202D>  How much soever hasted, or dead laid
<U+202D>  He should have left me.  Many a man I have,
<U+202D>  That would have calld old Dolius my slave,
<U+202D>  (That keeps my orchard, whom my father gave
<U+202D>  At my departure) to have run, and told
<U+202D>  Laertes this; to try if he could hold
<U+202D>  From running through the people, and from tears,
<U+202D>  In telling them of these vowd murderers;
<U+202D>  That both divine Ulysses hope, and his,
<U+202D>  Resolvd to end in their conspiracies.
<U+202D>     His nurse then, Euryclea, made reply:
<U+202D>  Dear sovreign, let me with your own hands die,
<U+202D>  Or cast me off here, Ill not keep from thee
<U+202D>  One word of what I know.  He trusted me
<U+202D>  With all his purpose, and I gave him all
<U+202D>  The bread and wine for which he pleasd to call.
<U+202D>  But then a mighty oath he made me swear,
<U+202D>  Not to report it to your royal ear
<U+202D>  Before the twelfth day either should appear,
<U+202D>  Or you should ask me when you heard him gone.
<U+202D>  Impair not then your beauties with your moan,
<U+202D>  But wash, and put untear-staind garments on,
<U+202D>  Ascend your chamber with your ladies here,
<U+202D>  And pray the seed of goat-nursd Jupiter,
<U+202D>  Divine Athenia, to preserve your son,
<U+202D>  And she will save him from confusión,
<U+202D>  Th old king, to whom your hopes stand so inclind
<U+202D>  For his grave counsels, you perhaps may find
<U+202D>  Unfit affected, for his ages sake.
<U+202D>  But heavn-kings wax not old, and therefore make
<U+202D>  Fit prayrs to them; for my thoughts never will
<U+202D>  Believe the heavnly Powrs conceit so ill
<U+202D>  The seed of righteous Arcesiades,
<U+202D>  To end it utterly, but still will please
<U+202D>  In some place evermore some one of them
<U+202D>  To save, and deck him with a diadem,
<U+202D>  Give him possession of erected towrs,
<U+202D>  And far-stretchd fields, crownd all of fruits and flowrs.
<U+202D>  This easd her heart, and dried her humorous eyes,
<U+202D>  When having washd, and weeds of sacrifice
<U+202D>  Pure, and unstaind with her distrustful tears,
<U+202D>  Put on, with all her women-ministers
<U+202D>  Up to a chamber of most height she rose,
<U+202D>  And cakes of salt and barley did impose
<U+202D>  Within a wicker basket; all which broke
<U+202D>  In decent order, thus she did invoke:
<U+202D>     Great Virgin of the goat-preservéd God,
<U+202D>  If ever the inhabited abode
<U+202D>  Of wise Ulysses held the fatted thighs
<U+202D>  Of sheep and oxen, made thy sacrifice
<U+202D>  By his devotion, hear me, nor forget
<U+202D>  His pious services, but safe see set
<U+202D>  His dear son on these shores, and banish hence
<U+202D>  These Wooers past all mean in insolence.
<U+202D>     This said, she shriekd, and Pallas heard her prayr.
<U+202D>  The Wooers broke with tumult all the air
<U+202D>  About the shady house; and one of them,
<U+202D>  Whose pride his youth had made the more extreme,
<U+202D>  Said:  Now the many-wooer-honourd queen
<U+202D>  Will surely satiate her delayful spleen,
<U+202D>  And one of us in instant nuptials take.
<U+202D>  Poor dame, she dreams not, what design we make
<U+202D>  Upon the life and slaughter of her son.
<U+202D>     So said he; but so said was not so done;
<U+202D>  Whose arrogant spirit in a vaunt so vain
<U+202D>  Antinous chid, and said:  For shame, contain
<U+202D>  These braving speeches.  Who can tell who hears?
<U+202D>  Are we not now in reach of others ears?
<U+202D>  If our intentions please us, let us call
<U+202D>  Our spirits up to them, and let speeches fall.
<U+202D>  By watchful danger men must silent go.
<U+202D>  What we resolve on, lets not say, but do.
<U+202D>  This said, he choosd out twenty men, that bore
<U+202D>  Best reckoning with him, and to ship and shore
<U+202D>  All hasted, reachd the ship, launchd, raisd the mast,
<U+202D>  Put sails in, and with leather loops made fast
<U+202D>  The oars; sails hoisted, arms their men did bring,
<U+202D>  All giving speed and form to evrything.
<U+202D>  Then to the high deeps their riggd vessel driven,
<U+202D>  They suppd, expecting the approaching even.
<U+202D>     Mean space, Penelope her chamber kept
<U+202D>  And bed, and neither eat, nor drank, nor slept,
<U+202D>  Her strong thoughts wrought so on her blameless son,
<U+202D>  Still in contention, if he should be done
<U+202D>  To death, or scape the impious Wooers design.
<U+202D>  Look how a lion, whom men-troops combine
<U+202D>  To hunt, and close him in a crafty ring,
<U+202D>  Much varied thought conceives, and fear doth sting
<U+202D>  For urgent danger; so fard she, till sleep
<U+202D>  All juncture of her joints and nerves did steep
<U+202D>  In his dissolving humour.  When, at rest,
<U+202D>  Pallas her favours varied, when addrest
<U+202D>  An idol, that Iphthima did present
<U+202D>  In structure of her evry lineament,  [5]
<U+202D>  Great-sould Icarius daughter, whom for spouse
<U+202D>  Eumelus took, that kept in Pheris house.
<U+202D>  This to divine Ulysses house she sent,
<U+202D>  To try her best mean how she might content
<U+202D>  Mournful Penelope, and make relent
<U+202D>  The strict addiction in her to deplore.
<U+202D>  This idol, like a worm, that less or more  [6]
<U+202D>  Contracts or strains her, did itself convey,
<U+202D>  Beyond the wards or windings of the key,
<U+202D>  Into the chamber, and, above her head
<U+202D>  Her seat assuming, thus she comforted
<U+202D>  Distressd Penelope:  Doth sleep thus seize
<U+202D>  Thy powrs, affected with so much dis-ease?
<U+202D>  The Gods, that nothing troubles, will not see
<U+202D>  Thy tears nor griefs, in any least degree,
<U+202D>  Sustaind with cause, for they will guard thy son
<U+202D>  Safe to his wishd and native mansión.
<U+202D>  Since he is no offender of their states,
<U+202D>  And they to such are firmer than their fates.
<U+202D>     The wise Penelope receivd her thus,
<U+202D>  Bound with a slumber most delicious,
<U+202D>  And in the port of dreams:  O sister, why
<U+202D>  Repair you hither, since so far off lie
<U+202D>  Your house and household?  You were never here
<U+202D>  Before this hour, and would you now give cheer
<U+202D>  To my so many woes and miseries,
<U+202D>  Affecting fitly all the faculties
<U+202D>  My soul and mind hold, having lost before
<U+202D>  A husband, that of all the virtues bore
<U+202D>  The palm amongst the Greeks, and whose renown
<U+202D>  So ample was that Fame the sound hath blown
<U+202D>  Through Greece and Argos to her very heart?
<U+202D>  And now again, a son, that did convert
<U+202D>  My whole powrs to his love, by ship is gone;
<U+202D>  A tender plant, that yet was never grown
<U+202D>  To labours taste, nor the commerce of men;
<U+202D>  For whom more than my husband I complain,
<U+202D>  And lest he should at any suffrance touch
<U+202D>  (Or in the sea, or by the men so much
<U+202D>  Estrangd to him that must his consorts be)
<U+202D>  Fear and chill tremblings shake each joint of me.
<U+202D>  Besides, his danger sets on foes professd
<U+202D>  To way-lay his return, that have addressd
<U+202D>  Plots for his death.  The scarce-discernéd Dream,
<U+202D>  Said:  Be of comfort, nor fears so extreme
<U+202D>  Let thus dismay thee; thou hast such a mate
<U+202D>  Attending thee, as some at any rate
<U+202D>  Would wish to purchase, for her powr is great;
<U+202D>  Minerva pities thy delights defeat,
<U+202D>  Whose grace hath sent me to foretell thee these.
<U+202D>     If thou,  said she,  be of the Goddesses,
<U+202D>  And heardst her tell thee these, thou mayst as well
<U+202D>  From her tell all things else.  Deign then to tell,
<U+202D>  If yet the man to all misfortunes born,
<U+202D>  My husband, lives, and sees the sun adorn
<U+202D>  The darksome earth, or hides his wretched head
<U+202D>  In Plutos house, and lives amongst the dead?
<U+202D>     I will not,  she replied,  my breath exhale
<U+202D>  In one continued and perpetual tale,
<U+202D>  Lives he or dies he.  Tis a filthy use,
<U+202D>  To be in vain and idle speech profuse.
<U+202D>  This said, she, through the key-hole of the door,
<U+202D>  Vanishd again into the open blore.
<U+202D>  Icarius daughter started from her sleep,
<U+202D>  And Joys fresh humour her lovd breast did steep,
<U+202D>  When now so clear, in that first watch of night,
<U+202D>  She saw the seen Dream vanish from her sight.
<U+202D>     The Wooers ship the seas moist waves did ply,
<U+202D>  And thought the prince a haughty death should die.
<U+202D>  There lies a certain island in the sea,
<U+202D>  Twixt rocky Samos and rough Ithaca,
<U+202D>  That cliffy is itself, and nothing great,
<U+202D>  Yet holds convenient havens that two ways let
<U+202D>  Ships in and out, calld Asteris; and there
<U+202D>  The Wooers hopd to make their massacre.
