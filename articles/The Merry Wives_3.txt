_Pist._ He hath studied her will, and translated her will,          45
out of honesty into English.
_Nym._ The anchor is deep: will that humour pass?
_Fal._ Now, the report goes she has all the rule of her
husband's purse: he hath a legion of angels.
_Pist._ As many devils entertain; and 'To her, boy,' say I.         50
_Nym._ The humour rises; it is good: humour me the
angels.
_Fal._ I have writ me here a letter to her: and here
another to Page's wife, who even now gave me good eyes
too, examined my parts with most judicious oeillades;                55
sometimes the beam of her view gilded my foot, sometimes
my portly belly.
_Pist._ Then did the sun on dunghill shine.
_Nym._ I thank thee for that humour.
_Fal._ O, she did so course o'er my exteriors with such             60
a greedy intention, that the appetite of her eye did seem to
scorch me up like a burning-glass! Here's another letter
to her: she bears the purse too; she is a region in Guiana,
all gold and bounty. I will be cheaters to them both, and
they shall be exchequers to me; they shall be my East               65
and West Indies, and I will trade to them both. Go bear
thou this letter to Mistress Page; and thou this to Mistress
Ford: we will thrive, lads, we will thrive.
_Pist._ Shall I Sir Pandarus of Troy become,
And by my side wear steel? then, Lucifer take all!                  70
_Nym._ I will run no base humour: here, take the
humour-letter: I will keep the haviour of reputation.
_Fal._ [_To Robin_] Hold, sirrah, bear you these letters tightly;
Sail like my pinnace to these golden shores.
Rogues, hence, avaunt! vanish like hailstones, go;                  75
Trudge, plod away o' the hoof; seek shelter, pack!
Falstaff will learn the humour of the age,
French thrift, you rogues; myself and skirted page.
    [_Exeunt Falstaff and Robin._
_Pist._ Let vultures gripe thy guts! for gourd and fullam holds,
And high and low beguiles the rich and poor:                        80
Tester I'll have in pouch when thou shalt lack,
Base Phrygian Turk!
_Nym._ I have operations which be humours of revenge.
_Pist._ Wilt thou revenge?
_Nym._ By welkin and her star!                                      85
_Pist._ With wit or steel?
_Nym._ With both the humours, I:
I will discuss the humour of this love to Page.
_Pist._ And I to Ford shall eke unfold
  How Falstaff, varlet vile,                                        90
His dove will prove, his gold will hold,
  And his soft couch defile.
_Nym._ My humour shall not cool: I will incense Page
to deal with poison; I will possess him with yellowness, for
the revolt of mine is dangerous: that is my true humour.            95
_Pist._ Thou art the Mars of malecontents: I second
thee; troop on.    [_Exeunt._
