_The Names of the English Officers which I knew to be killed in this
Action_.
Lieut. Col. Archer,      Capt. Pemfield,
Capt. Charleton,         Lieut. Charleton,
Capt. Richardson,        Lieut. Barton,
Capt. Fisher,            Ensign Colville.
With several others, whose Names I have forgot.
Lieut. Col. _Babington_, who began the Attack, by beating the _French_
out of the Hop Garden, was taken Prisoner. Col. _Hales_, who was a long
time Governor of _Chelsea College_, being then a Captain, received a
Shot on his Leg, of which he went lame to his dying Day.
The War thus ended by the Peace of _Nimeugen_, The Regiment in which I
serv'd, was appointed to be in Garrison at the _Grave_. We lay there
near four Years, our Soldiers being mostly employ'd about the
Fortifications. It was here, and by that Means, that I imbib'd the
Rudiments of Fortification, and the practick Part of an Enginier, which
in my more advanc'd Years was of no small Service to me.
Nevertheless, in the Year 1684, our Regiment receiv'd Orders to march to
_Haren_, near _Brussels_, where, with other Forces, we encamp'd, till we
heard that _Luxemburg_, invaded by the _French,_ in a Time of the
profoundest Peace, had surrender'd to them. Then we decamp'd, and
march'd to _Mechlin_; where we lay in the Field till near _November_.
Not that there was any War proclaim'd; but as not knowing, whether those
who had committed such Acts of Hostility in time of Peace might not take
it in their Heads to proceed yet further. In _November_ we march'd into
that Town, where Count _Nivelle_ was Governor: The Marquiss _de Grana_,
at the same time, governing the _Netherlands_ in the Jurisdiction of
_Spain_.
Nothing of any Moment happen'd after this, till the Death of King
_Charles_ II. The Summer after which, the three _English_ and three
_Scotch_ Regiments receiv'd Orders to pass over into _England_, upon the
Occasion of _Monmouth's_ Rebellion; where, upon our Arrival, we receiv'd
Orders to encamp on _Hounslow-Heath_. But that Rebellion being soon
stifled, and King _James_ having no farther Need of us, those Regiments
were order'd to return again to _Holland_, into the proper Service of
those who paid them.
Tho' I am no stiff Adherer to the Doctrine of Predestination, yet to the
full Assurance of a Providence I never could fail to adhere. Thence came
it, that my natural Desire to serve my own native Country prevail'd upon
me to quit the Service of another, though its Neighbour and Allie.
Events are not always to direct the Judgment; and therefore whether I
did best in following those fondling Dictates of Nature, I shall neither
question nor determine.
However, it was not long after my Arrival in _England_ before I had a
Commission given me by King _James_, to be a Lieutenant in a new rais'd
Regiment under the Command of Colonel _Tufton_, Brother to the Earl of
_Thanet_. Under this Commission I sojourn'd out two peaceable Campaigns
on _Hounslow-Heath;_ where I was an Eye-Witness of one mock Siege of
_Buda_: After which our Regiment was order'd to _Berwick_, where I
remained till the Revolution.
