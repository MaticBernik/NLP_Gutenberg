   Which Painters hold, and such the heritage
      This gentle solemn Spirit doth possess,
   Being a better mirror of his age
      In all his pity, love, and weariness,
   Than those who can but copy common things,
   And leave the Soul unpainted with its mighty questionings.
   But they are few, and all romance has flown,
      And men can prophesy about the sun,
   And lecture on his arrowshow, alone,
      Through a waste void the soulless atoms run,
   How from each tree its weeping nymph has fled,
   And that no more mid English reeds a Naiad shows her head.
   Methinks these new Actaons boast too soon
      That they have spied on beauty; what if we
   Have analysed the rainbow, robbed the moon
      Of her most ancient, chastest mystery,
   Shall I, the last Endymion, lose all hope
   Because rude eyes peer at my mistress through a telescope!
   What profit if this scientific age
      Burst through our gates with all its retinue
   Of modern miracles!  Can it assuage
      One lovers breaking heart? what can it do
   To make one life more beautiful, one day
   More godlike in its period? but now the Age of Clay
   Returns in horrid cycle, and the earth
      Hath borne again a noisy progeny
   Of ignorant Titans, whose ungodly birth
      Hurls them against the august hierarchy
   Which sat upon Olympus; to the Dust
   They have appealed, and to that barren arbiter they must
   Repair for judgment; let them, if they can,
      From Natural Warfare and insensate Chance,
   Create the new Ideal rule for man!
      Methinks that was not my inheritance;
   For I was nurtured otherwise, my soul
   Passes from higher heights of life to a more supreme goal.
   Lo! while we spake the earth did turn away
      Her visage from the God, and Hecates boat
   Rose silver-laden, till the jealous day
      Blew all its torches out: I did not note
   The waning hours, to young Endymions
   Times palsied fingers count in vain his rosary of suns!
   Mark how the yellow iris wearily
      Leans back its throat, as though it would be kissed
   By its false chamberer, the dragon-fly,
      Who, like a blue vein on a girls white wrist,
   Sleeps on that snowy primrose of the night,
   Which gins to flush with crimson shame, and die beneath the light.
   Come let us go, against the pallid shield
      Of the wan sky the almond blossoms gleam,
   The corncrake nested in the unmown field
      Answers its mate, across the misty stream
   On fitful wing the startled curlews fly,
   And in his sedgy bed the lark, for joy that Day is nigh,
   Scatters the pearled dew from off the grass,
      In tremulous ecstasy to greet the sun,
   Who soon in gilded panoply will pass
      Forth from yon orange-curtained pavilion
   Hung in the burning east: see, the red rim
   Oertops the expectant hills! it is the God! for love of him
   Already the shrill lark is out of sight,
      Flooding with waves of song this silent dell,
   Ah! there is something more in that birds flight
      Than could be tested in a crucible!
   But the air freshens, let us go, why soon
   The woodmen will be here; how we have lived this night of June!
