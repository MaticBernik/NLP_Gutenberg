    _Luc._ Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise.
    If, Biondello, thou wert come ashore,
    We could at once put us in readiness,
    And take a lodging fit to entertain
    Such friends as time in Padua shall beget.                        45
    But stay a while: what company is this?
    _Tra._ Master, some show to welcome us to town.
_Enter_ BAPTISTA, KATHARINA, BIANCA, GREMIO, _and_ HORTENSIO.
LUCENTIO _and_ TRANIO _stand by_.
    _Bap._ Gentlemen, importune me no farther,
    For how I firmly am resolved you know;
    That is, not to bestow my youngest daughter                       50
    Before I have a husband for the elder:
    If either of you both love Katharina,
    Because I know you well and love you well,
    Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.
    _Gre._ [_Aside_] To cart her rather: she's too rough for me.      55
    There, there, Hortensio, will you any wife?
    _Kath._ I pray you, sir, is it your will
    To make a stale of me amongst these mates?
    _Hor._ Mates, maid! how mean you that? no mates for you,
    Unless you were of gentler, milder mould.                         60
    _Kath._ I'faith, sir, you shall never need to fear:
    I wis it is not half way to her heart;
    But if it were, doubt not her care should be
    To comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool
    And paint your face and use you like a fool.                      65
    _Hor._ From all such devils, good Lord deliver us!
    _Gre._ And me too, good Lord!
    _Tra._ Husht, master! here's some good pastime toward:
    That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward.
    _Luc._ But in the other's silence do I see                        70
    Maid's mild behaviour and sobriety.
    Peace, Tranio!
    _Tra._ Well said, master; mum! and gaze your fill.
    _Bap._ Gentlemen, that I may soon make good
    What I have said, Bianca, get you in:                             75
    And let it not displease thee, good Bianca,
    For I will love thee ne'er the less, my girl.
    _Kath._ A pretty peat! it is best
    Put finger in the eye, an she knew why.
    _Bian._ Sister, content you in my discontent.                     80
    Sir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe:
    My books and instruments shall be my company,
    On them to look and practise by myself.
    _Luc._ Hark, Tranio! thou may'st hear Minerva speak.
    _Hor._ Signior Baptista, will you be so strange?                  85
    Sorry am I that our good will effects
    Bianca's grief.
    _Gre._          Why will you mew her up,
    Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell,
    And make her bear the penance of her tongue?
    _Bap._ Gentlemen, content ye; I am resolved:                      90
    Go in, Bianca:                               [_Exit Bianca._
    And for I know she taketh most delight
    In music, instruments and poetry,
    Schoolmasters will I keep within my house,
    Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio,                     95
    Or Signior Gremio, you, know any such,
    Prefer them hither; for to cunning men
    I will be very kind, and liberal
    To mine own children in good bringing-up:
    And so farewell. Katharina, you may stay;                        100
    For I have more to commune with Bianca.             [_Exit._
