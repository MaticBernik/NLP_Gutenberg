Arnholm. Yes; I remember that of old.
Wangel (with an almost imperceptible smile). To be sure! You knew Ellida
when you were teacher out there at Skjoldviken.
Arnholm. Certainly. She used often to visit at the Parsonage. But I
mostly met her when I went to the lighthouse to see her father.
Wangel. Those times out there, you may believe me, have set deep marks
upon her. The people in the town here can't understand her at all. They
call her the "Lady from the Sea."
Arnholm. Do they?
Wangel. Yes. And so--now, you see, speak to her of the old days, dear
Arnholm, it will do her good.
Arnholm (looks at him in doubt). Have you any reason for thinking so?
Wangel. Assuredly I have.
Ellida (her voice is heard outside the garden). Are you there, Wangel?
Wangel (rising). Yes, dear.
(Mrs. ELLIDA WANGEL, in a large, light wrap, and with wet hair hanging
loose over her shoulders, comes from between the trees of the arbour.
ARNHOLM rises.)
Wangel (smiling, and holding out his hands to her). Ah! So now we have
our Mermaid!
Ellida (goes quickly up the verandah, and seizes his hands). Thank God
that I see you again! When did you come?
Wangel. Just now; a little while since. (Pointing to ARNHOLM.) But won't
you greet an old acquaintance?
Ellida (holding out her hand to ARNHOLM). So here you are! Welcome! And
forgive me for not being at home--
Arnholm. Don't mention it--don't stand on any ceremony.
Wangel. Was the water nice and fresh today?
Ellida. Fresh! Oh! The water here never is fresh. It is so tepid and
lifeless. Ugh! The water in the fjord here is sick.
Arnholm. Sick?
Ellida. Yes, sick. And I believe it makes one sick, too.
Wangel (smiling). You're giving our bathing resort a good name!
Arnholm. I should rather believe, Mrs. Wangel, that you have a peculiar
relation to the sea, and to all that belongs to it.
Ellida. Perhaps; I almost think so myself. But do you see how festively
the girls have arranged everything in your honour?
Wangel (embarrassed). Hm! (Looks at his watch.) Well, I suppose I must
be quick and--
Arnholm. Is it really for me?
Ellida. Yes. You may be sure we don't decorate like this every day.
Ugh! How suffocatingly hot it is under this roof. (Goes down into the
garden.) Come over here. Here at least there is a little air. (Sits down
in arbour.)
Arnholm (going thither). I think the air quite fresh here.
Ellida. Yes, you--who are used to the stifling air of the town! It's
terrible there in the summer, I hear.
Wangel (who has also gone into the garden). Hm, dear Ellida, you must
just entertain our friend alone for a little while.
Ellida. Are you busy?
Wangel. Yes, I must go down to the office. And then I must change. But I
won't be long.
Arnholm (sitting down in arbour). Now, don't hurry, dear doctor. Your
wife and I will manage to kill the time.
