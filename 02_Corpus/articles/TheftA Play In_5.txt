(_He pauses a moment, and then his thin lips shut grimly. But he
has just about shot his bolt._)
{Margaret}
What do you mean?
{Starkweather}
He has let himself in to give a speech to-morrow, wherein he will
be called upon to deliver the proofs of all the lurid charges he
has made against the Administration--against us, the stewards of
wealth if you please. He will be unable to deliver the proofs,
and the nation will laugh. And that will be the political end of
Mr. Ali Baba and his dream.
{Margaret}
It is a beautiful dream. Were there more like him the dream would
come true. After all, it is the dreamers that build and that
never die. Perhaps you will find that he is not so easily to be
destroyed. But I can't stay and argue with you, father. I simply
must go and get my things off.
(_To Connie._) You'll have to receive, dear. I'll be right back.
(_Julius Rutland enters. Margaret advances to meet him, shaking
his hand._) You must forgive me for deserting for a moment.
{Rutland}
(_Greeting the others._) A family council, I see.
{Margaret}
(_On way to exit at rear._) No; a discussion on dreams and
dreamers. I leave you to bear my part.
{Rutland}
(_Bowing._) With pleasure. The dreamers are the true architects.
But--a--what is the dream and who is the dreamer?
{Margaret}
(_Pausing in the doorway._) The dream of social justice, of fair
play and a square deal to everybody. The dreamer--Mr. Knox.
(_Rutland is so patently irritated, that Margaret lingers in the
doorway to enjoy._)
{Rutland}
That man! He has insulted and reviled the Church--my calling.
He--
{Connie}
(_Interrupting._) He said the churchmen stole from God. I remember
he once said there had been only one true Christian and that He
died on the Cross.
{Margaret}
He quoted that from Nietzsche.
{Starkweather}
(_To Rutland, in quiet glee._) He had you there.
{Rutland}
(_In composed fury._) Nietzsche is a blasphemer, sir. Any man who
reads Nietzsche or quotes Nietzsche is a blasphemer. It augurs
ill for the future of America when such pernicious literature has
the vogue it has.
{Margaret}
(_Interrupting, laughing._) I leave the quarrel in your hands, sir
knight. Remember--the dreamer and the dream. (_Margaret makes
exit._)
{Rutland}
(_Shaking his head._) I cannot understand what is coming over the
present generation. Take your daughter, for instance. Ten years
ago she was an earnest, sincere lieutenant of mine in all our
little charities.
{Starkweather}
Has she given charity up?
{Connie}
It's settlement work, now, and kindergartens.
{Rutland}
(_Ominously._) It's writers like Nietzsche, and men who read him,
like Knox, who are responsible.
(_Senator Dowsett and Mrs. Dowsett enter from rear._)
(_Connie advances to greet them. Rutland knows Mrs. Dowsett, and
Connie introduces him to Senator Dowsett._)
(_In the meantime, not bothering to greet anybody, evincing
his own will and way, Starkweather goes across to right front,
selects one of several chairs, seats himself, pulls a thin
note-book from inside coat pocket, and proceeds to immerse
himself in contents of same._) (_Dowsett and Rutland pair and
stroll to left rear and seat themselves, while Connie and Mrs.
Dowsett seat themselves at tea-table to left front. Connie rings
the bell for Servant._)
