_Val._ I know it well, sir; you always end ere you begin.
_Sil._ A fine volley of words, gentlemen, and quickly               30
shot off.
_Val._ 'Tis indeed, madam; we thank the giver.
_Sil._ Who is that, servant?
_Val._ Yourself, sweet lady; for you gave the fire. Sir
Thurio borrows his wit from your ladyship's looks, and              35
spends what he borrows kindly in your company.
_Thu._ Sir, if you spend word for word with me, I shall
make your wit bankrupt.
_Val._ I know it well, sir; you have an exchequer of
words, and, I think, no other treasure to give your followers,      40
for it appears, by their bare liveries, that they live by
your bare words.
_Sil._ No more, gentlemen, no more:--here comes my father.
  _Enter DUKE._
_Duke._ Now, daughter Silvia, you are hard beset.                   45
Sir Valentine, your father's in good health:
What say you to a letter from your friends
Of much good news?
_Val._           My lord, I will be thankful
To any happy messenger from thence.
_Duke._ Know ye Don Antonio, your countryman?                       50
_Val._ Ay, my good lord, I know the gentleman
To be of worth, and worthy estimation,
And not without desert so well reputed.
_Duke._ Hath he not a son?
_Val._ Ay, my good lord; a son that well deserves                   55
The honour and regard of such a father.
_Duke._ You know him well?
_Val._ I know him as myself; for from our infancy
We have conversed and spent our hours together:
And though myself have been an idle truant,                         60
Omitting the sweet benefit of time
To clothe mine age with angel-like perfection,
Yet hath Sir Proteus, for that's his name,
Made use and fair advantage of his days;
His years but young, but his experience old;                        65
His head unmellow'd, but his judgment ripe;
And, in a word, for far behind his worth
Comes all the praises that I now bestow,
He is complete in feature and in mind
With all good grace to grace a gentleman.                           70
_Duke._ Beshrew me, sir, but if he make this good,
He is as worthy for an empress' love
As meet to be an emperor's counsellor.
Well, sir, this gentleman is come to me,
With commendation from great potentates;                            75
And here he means to spend his time awhile:
I think 'tis no unwelcome news to you.
_Val._ Should I have wish'd a thing, it had been he.
_Duke._ Welcome him, then, according to his worth.
Silvia, I speak to you, and you, Sir Thurio,                        80
For Valentine, I need not cite him to it:
I will send him hither to you presently.    [_Exit._
_Val._ This is the gentleman I told your ladyship
Had come along with me, but that his mistress
Did hold his eyes lock'd in her crystal looks.                      85
_Sil._ Belike that now she hath enfranchised them,
Upon some other pawn for fealty.
_Val._ Nay, sure, I think she holds them prisoners still.
_Sil._ Nay, then, he should be blind; and, being blind,
How could he see his way to seek out you?                           90
