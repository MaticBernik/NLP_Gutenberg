And where is he?
IRENE.
Far away in the Ural Mountains. Among all his gold-mines.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
So he lives there?
IRENE.
[Shrugs her shoulders.] Lives? Lives? In reality I have killed him--
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Start.] Killed--!
IRENE.
Killed him with a fine sharp dagger which I always have with me in bed--
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Vehemently.] I don't believe you, Irene!
IRENE.
[With a gentle smile.] Indeed you may believe it, Arnold.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Looks compassionately at her.] Have you never had a child?
IRENE.
Yes, I have had many children.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
And where are your children now?
IRENE.
I killed them.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Severely.] Now you are telling me lies again!
IRENE.
I have killed them, I tell you--murdered them pitilessly. As soon as
ever they came into the world. Oh, long, long before. One after the
other.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Sadly and earnestly.] There is something hidden behind everything you
say.
IRENE.
How can I help that? Every word I say is whispered into my ear.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
I believe I am the only one that can divine your meaning.
IRENE.
Surely you ought to be the only one.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Rests his hands on the table and looks intently at her.] Some of the
strings of your nature have broken.
IRENE.
[Gently.] Does not that always happen when a young warm-blooded woman
dies?
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Oh Irene, have done with these wild imaginings--! You are living!
Living--living!
IRENE.
[Rises slowly from her chair and says, quivering.] I was dead for many
years. They came and bound me--laced my arms together behind my back--.
Then they lowered me into a grave-vault, with iron bars before the
loop-hole. And with padded walls--so that no one on the earth above
could hear the grave-shrieks--. But now I am beginning, in a way, to
rise from the dead.
    [She seats herself again.]
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[After a pause.] In all this, do you hold me guilty?
IRENE.
Yes.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Guilty of that--your death, as you call it.
IRENE.
Guilty of the fact that I had to die. [Changing her tone to one of
indifference.] Why don't you sit down, Arnold?
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
May I?
IRENE.
Yes.--You need not be afraid of being frozen. I don't think I am quite
turned to ice yet.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Moves a chair and seats himself at her table.] There, Irene. Now we two
are sitting together as in the old days.
IRENE.
A little way apart from each other--also as in the old days.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Moving nearer.] It had to be so, then.
IRENE.
Had it?
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Decisively.] There had to be a distance between us--
IRENE.
Was it absolutely necessary, Arnold?
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Continuing.] Do you remember what you answered when I asked if you
would go with me out into the wide world?
IRENE.
I held up three fingers in the air and swore that I would go with you
to the world's end and to the end of life. And that I would serve you in
all things--
