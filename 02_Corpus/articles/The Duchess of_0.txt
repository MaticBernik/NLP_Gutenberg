MORANZONE [_coldly_]
   Fool, what revenge is there?
   Death is the common heritage of all,
   And death comes best when it comes suddenly.
                                               [_Goes up close to_ GUIDO.]
   Your father was betrayed, there is your cue;
   For you shall sell the seller in his turn.
   I will make you of his household, you shall sit
   At the same board with him, eat of his bread
GUIDO
   O bitter bread!
MORANZONE
   Thy palate is too nice,
   Revenge will make it sweet.  Thou shalt o nights
   Pledge him in wine, drink from his cup, and be
   His intimate, so he will fawn on thee,
   Love thee, and trust thee in all secret things.
   If he bid thee be merry thou must laugh,
   And if it be his humour to be sad
   Thou shalt don sables.  Then when the time is ripe
                                             [GUIDO _clutches his sword_.]
   Nay, nay, I trust thee not; your hot young blood,
   Undisciplined nature, and too violent rage
   Will never tarry for this great revenge,
   But wreck itself on passion.
GUIDO
   Thou knowest me not.
   Tell me the man, and I in everything
   Will do thy bidding.
MORANZONE
   Well, when the time is ripe,
   The victim trusting and the occasion sure,
   I will by sudden secret messenger
   Send thee a sign.
GUIDO
   How shall I kill him, tell me?
MORANZONE
   That night thou shalt creep into his private chamber;
   But if he sleep see that thou wake him first,
   And hold thy hand upon his throat, ay! that way,
   Then having told him of what blood thou art,
   Sprung from what father, and for what revenge,
   Bid him to pray for mercy; when he prays,
   Bid him to set a price upon his life,
   And when he strips himself of all his gold
   Tell him thou needest not gold, and hast not mercy,
   And do thy business straight away.  Swear to me
   Thou wilt not kill him till I bid thee do it,
   Or else I go to mine own house, and leave
   Thee ignorant, and thy father unavenged.
GUIDO
   Now by my fathers sword
MORANZONE
   The common hangman
   Brake that in sunder in the public square.
GUIDO
   Then by my fathers grave
MORANZONE
   What grave? what grave?
   Your noble father lieth in no grave,
   I saw his dust strewn on the air, his ashes
   Whirled through the windy streets like common straws
   To plague a beggars eyesight, and his head,
   That gentle head, set on the prison spike,
   For the vile rabble in their insolence
   To shoot their tongues at.
GUIDO
   Was it so indeed?
   Then by my fathers spotless memory,
   And by the shameful manner of his death,
   And by the base betrayal by his friend,
   For these at least remain, by these I swear
   I will not lay my hand upon his life
   Until you bid me, thenGod help his soul,
   For he shall die as never dog died yet.
   And now, the sign, what is it?
MORANZONE
   This dagger, boy;
   It was your fathers.
GUIDO
   Oh, let me look at it!
   I do remember now my reputed uncle,
   That good old husbandman I left at home,
   Told me a cloak wrapped round me when a babe
   Bare too such yellow leopards wrought in gold;
   I like them best in steel, as they are here,
   They suit my purpose better.  Tell me, sir,
   Have you no message from my father to me?
