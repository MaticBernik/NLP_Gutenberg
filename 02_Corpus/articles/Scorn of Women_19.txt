_(Cheers, laughter, and consent.)_
A VOICE
But we haven't any pen or ink, Dave.
DAVE HARNEY
You've got to sit up all night to get up earlier than Dave Harney in
the mornin'. Here you are.
_(Draws pen, inkstand, and paper pad from pockets.)_
An' you might as well sign first, young feller.
_(The signing of notes begins, Dave Harney, with ink and paper,
passing from one to another as the rout breaks up and starts back to
ballroom for next dance.)_
_(Pausing in doorway to left.)_
Just as easy--like shooting fish in a bucket.
_(Goes out.)_
_(Enter Mrs. Eppingwell on arm of Vanderlip, who is still in domino.
They promenade, talking, about room. They are followed by Loraine
Lisznayi, masked and magnificently costumed, who keeps her eyes on
them and betrays keen interest in them.)_
MRS. EPPINGWELL
Wasn't it funny I guessed you, Mr. Vanderlip, in that first dance?
VANDERLIP
You have a good eye.
MRS. EPPINGWELL
And possibly I really wanted to find you, you know.
VANDERLIP
_(Awkwardly, but pleased.)_
Hum, yes, I suppose so. And I was looking for you, too, hard as I
could.
MRS. EPPINGWELL
You'd never guess how I guessed you.
_(He shakes his head.)_
It is very simple. You are the same height as Captain Eppingwell.
_(She laughs merrily.)_
VANDERLIP
_(Looking at dance-card.)_
Hello, I haven't the next dance with you!
MRS. EPPINGWELL
No, that's promised to--well, to somebody else.
VANDERLIP
But the next after is mine.
MRS. EPPINGWELL
_(Looking at dance-card.)_
And the next after that. I'm almost afraid I'm dancing too much with
you. What will people say?
VANDERLIP
_(Pleased, and eagerly.)_
Ah, but they don't know who we are.
MRS. EPPINGWELL
They will after the unmasking. Then they will remember us together so
much.
VANDERLIP
_(As though struck by a thought of something else.)_
What time will they unmask?
MRS. EPPINGWELL
Two o'clock. And _(Looks at card.)_ there is a waltz after that I
should like. You do waltz so well, Mr. Vanderlip.
VANDERLIP
I won't be able to make that waltz, I--_(Breaks off suddenly.)_
MRS. EPPINGWELL
Why, you, of all men, are not going home early?
VANDERLIP
No--I--that is--
_(Looks at card, studies it profoundly, as though it would get him out
of his difficulty.)_
Why, yes, of course we can have that waltz together. I thought it was
already engaged, that was all.
_(Enter Capt. Eppingwell, who comes up to them, still in domino.)_
CAPT. EPPINGWELL
_(Disguising voice.)_
The next is mine, I believe, fair lady.
_(Vanderlip ranges up alongside of him and measures height of
shoulders. Capt. Eppingwell curiously observes the action, and speaks
with gruff voice.)_
Well, stranger, what's up?
VANDERLIP
We're both up.
CAPT. EPPINGWELL
Up to what?
VANDERLIP
Up to each other. We're the same height, and I've guessed you, Captain
Eppingwell.
_(All laugh together, and Capt. Eppingwell bears Mrs. Eppingwell away.
They make exit to left.)_
_(Loraine accosts Vanderlip.)_
LORAINE
_(In disguised voice.)_
A word in your ear, sir.
_(Vanderlip is politely agreeable, and listens.)_
