TESMAN.
Expectations?
MISS TESMAN.
Why you know, George--I'm your old auntie!
TESMAN.
Why, of course I have expectations.
MISS TESMAN.
Ah!
TESMAN.
I have every expectation of being a professor one of these days.
MISS TESMAN.
Oh yes, a professor--
TESMAN.
Indeed, I may say I am certain of it. But my dear Auntie--you know all
about that already!
MISS TESMAN.
[Laughing to herself.] Yes, of course I do. You are quite right there.
[Changing the subject.] But we were talking about your journey. It must
have cost a great deal of money, George?
TESMAN.
Well, you see--my handsome travelling-scholarship went a good way.
MISS TESMAN.
But I can't understand how you can have made it go far enough for two.
TESMAN.
No, that's not easy to understand--eh?
MISS TESMAN.
And especially travelling with a lady--they tell me that makes it ever
so much more expensive.
TESMAN.
Yes, of course--it makes it a little more expensive. But Hedda had to
have this trip, Auntie! She really had to. Nothing else would have done.
MISS TESMAN.
No no, I suppose not. A wedding-tour seems to be quite indispensable
nowadays.--But tell me now--have you gone thoroughly over the house yet?
TESMAN.
Yes, you may be sure I have. I have been afoot ever since daylight.
MISS TESMAN.
And what do you think of it all?
TESMAN.
I'm delighted! Quite delighted! Only I can't think what we are to do
with the two empty rooms between this inner parlour and Hedda's bedroom.
MISS TESMAN.
[Laughing.] Oh my dear George, I daresay you may find some use for
them--in the course of time.
TESMAN.
Why of course you are quite right, Aunt Julia! You mean as my library
increases--eh?
MISS TESMAN.
Yes, quite so, my dear boy. It was your library I was thinking of.
TESMAN.
I am specially pleased on Hedda's account. Often and often, before we
were engaged, she said that she would never care to live anywhere but in
Secretary Falk's villa.(2)
MISS TESMAN.
Yes, it was lucky that this very house should come into the market, just
after you had started.
TESMAN.
Yes, Aunt Julia, the luck was on our side, wasn't it--eh?
MISS TESMAN.
But the expense, my dear George! You will find it very expensive, all
this.
TESMAN.
[Looks at her, a little cast down.] Yes, I suppose I shall, Aunt!
MISS TESMAN.
Oh, frightfully!
TESMAN.
How much do you think? In round numbers?--Eh?
MISS TESMAN.
Oh, I can't even guess until all the accounts come in.
TESMAN.
Well, fortunately, Judge Brack has secured the most favourable terms for
me, so he said in a letter to Hedda.
MISS TESMAN.
Yes, don't be uneasy, my dear boy.--Besides, I have given security for
the furniture and all the carpets.
TESMAN.
Security? You? My dear Aunt Julia--what sort of security could you give?
MISS TESMAN.
I have given a mortgage on our annuity.
TESMAN.
[Jumps up.] What! On your--and Aunt Rina's annuity!
MISS TESMAN.
Yes, I knew of no other plan, you see.
