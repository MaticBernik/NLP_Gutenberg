_Nora_ (_takes her hand out of his and goes to the opposite side of the
Christmas Tree_). How hot it is in here; and I have such a lot to do.
_Helmer_ (_getting up and putting his papers in order_). Yes, and I must
try and read through some of these before dinner; and I must think about
your costume, too. And it is just possible I may have something ready in
gold paper to hang up on the Tree. (_Puts his hand on her head.)_ My
precious little singing-bird! (_He goes into his room and shuts the door
after him.)_
_Nora_ (_after a pause, whispers_). No, no--it isn't true. It's
impossible; it must be impossible.
(_The_ NURSE _opens the door on the left._)
_Nurse_. The little ones are begging so hard to be allowed to come in to
mamma.
_Nora_. No, no, no! Don't let them come in to me! You stay with them,
Anne.
_Nurse_. Very well, ma'am. (_Shuts the door._)
_Nora_ (_pale with terror_). Deprave my little children? Poison my home?
(_A short pause. Then she tosses her head._) It's not true. It can't
possibly be true.
ACT II
(THE SAME SCENE--_The Christmas Tree is in the corner by the piano,
stripped of its ornaments and with burnt-down candle-ends on its
dishevelled branches._ NORA'S _cloak and hat are lying on the sofa. She
is alone in the room, walking about uneasily. She stops by the sofa and
takes up her cloak._)
_Nora_ (_drops the cloak_). Someone is coming now! (_Goes to the door
and listens._) No--it is no one. Of course, no one will come today,
Christmas Day--nor tomorrow either. But, perhaps--(_opens the door and
looks out_.) No, nothing in the letter-box; it is quite empty. (_Comes
forward._) What rubbish! of course he can't be in earnest about it. Such
a thing couldn't happen; it is impossible--I have three little children.
(_Enter the_ NURSE _from the room on the left, carrying a big cardboard
box._)
_Nurse_. At last I have found the box with the fancy dress.
_Nora_. Thanks; put it on the table.
_Nurse_ (_doing so_). But it is very much in want of mending.
_Nora_. I should like to tear it into a hundred thousand pieces.
_Nurse_. What an idea! It can easily be put in order--just a little
patience.
_Nora_. Yes, I will go and get Mrs. Linde to come and help me with it.
_Nurse_. What, out again? In this horrible weather? You will catch cold,
ma'am, and make yourself ill.
_Nora_. Well, worse than that might happen. How are the children?
_Nurse_. The poor little souls are playing with their Christmas
presents, but--
_Nora_. Do they ask much for me?
_Nurse_. You see, they are so accustomed to have their mamma with them.
_Nora_. Yes, but, nurse, I shall not be able to be so much with them now
as I was before.
_Nurse_. Oh well, young children easily get accustomed to anything.
_Nora_. Do you think so? Do you think they would forget their mother if
she went away altogether?
