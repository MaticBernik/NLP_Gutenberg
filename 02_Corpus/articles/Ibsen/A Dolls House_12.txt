_Krogstad_. It would have been better for you if you had given up your
trip abroad.
_Nora_. No, that was impossible. That trip was to save my husband's
life; I couldn't give that up.
_Krogstad_. But did it never occur to you that you were committing a
fraud on me?
_Nora_. I couldn't take that into account; I didn't trouble myself about
you at all. I couldn't bear you, because you put so many heartless
difficulties in my way, although you knew what a dangerous condition my
husband was in.
_Krogstad_. Mrs. Helmer, you evidently do not realise clearly what it is
that you have been guilty of. But I can assure you that my one false
step, which lost me all my reputation, was nothing more or nothing worse
than what you have done.
_Nora_. You? Do you ask me to believe that you were brave enough to run
a risk to save your wife's life.
_Krogstad_. The law cares nothing about motives.
_Nora_. Then it must be a very foolish law.
_Krogstad_. Foolish or not, it is the law by which you will be judged,
if I produce this paper in court.
_Nora_. I don't believe it. Is a daughter not to be allowed to spare her
dying father anxiety and care? Is a wife not to be allowed to save her
husband's life? I don't know much about law; but I am certain that there
must be laws permitting such things as that. Have you no knowledge of
such laws--you who are a lawyer? You must be a very poor lawyer, Mr.
Krogstad.
_Krogstad_. Maybe. But matters of business--such business as you and I
have had together--do you think I don't understand that? Very well. Do
as you please. But let me tell you this--if I lose my position a second
time, you shall lose yours with me. (_He bows, and goes out through the
hall_.)
_Nora_ (_appears buried in thought for a short time, then tosses her
head)_. Nonsense! Trying to frighten me like that!--I am not so silly as
he thinks. (_Begins to busy herself putting the children's things in
order_.) And yet--? No, it's impossible! I did it for love's sake.
_The Children_ (_in the doorway on the left.)_ Mother, the stranger man
has gone out through the gate.
_Nora_. Yes, dears, I know. But, don't tell anyone about the stranger
man. Do you hear? Not even papa.
_Children_. No, mother; but will you come and play again?
_Nora_. No no,--not now.
_ Children_. But, mother, you promised us.
_Nora_. Yes, but I can't now. Run away in; I have such a lot to do. Run
away in, sweet little darlings. (_She gets them into the room by degrees
and shuts the door on them; then sits down on the sofa, takes up a piece
of needlework and sews a few stitches, but soon stops_.) No! (_Throws
down the work, gets up, goes to the hall door and calls out_.) Helen,
bring the Tree in. (_Goes to the table on the left, opens a drawer, and
stops again_.) No, no! it is quite impossible!
