Ellida. Well, then, I'll try to. How will you, as a sensible man,
explain to yourself that--(Looks round, and breaks off.) Wait a moment.
Here's a visitor.
(LYNGSTRAND comes along the road, and enters the garden. He has a flower
in his button-hole, and carries a large, handsome bouquet done up in
paper and silk ribbons. He stands somewhat hesitatingly and undecidedly
by the verandah.)
Ellida (from the arbour). Have you come to see the girls, Mr.
Lyngstrand?
Lyngstrand (turning round). Ah, madam, are you there? (Bows, and
comes nearer.) No, it's not that. It's not the young ladies. It's you
yourself, Mrs. Wangel. You know you gave me permission to come and see
you Ellida. Of course I did. You are always welcome here.
Lyngstrand. Thanks; and as it falls out so luckily that it's a festival
here today--
Ellida. Oh! Do you know about that?
Lyngstrand. Rather! And so I should like to take the liberty of
presenting this to Mrs. Wangel. (Bows, and offers her the bouquet.)
Ellida (smiling). But, my dear Mr. Lyngstrand, oughtn't you to give
these lovely flowers to Mr. Arnholm himself? For you know it's really
he Lyngstrand (looking uncertainly at both of them). Excuse me, but I
don't know this gentleman. It's only--I've only come about the birthday,
Mrs. Wangel.
Ellida. Birthday? You've made a mistake, Mr. Lyngstrand. There's no
birthday here today.
Lyngstrand (smiling slyly). Oh! I know all about that! But I didn't
think it was to be kept so dark.
Ellida. What do you know?
Lyngstrand. That it is Madam's birthday.
Ellida. Mine?
Arnholm (looks questioningly at her). Today? Surely not.
Ellida (to LYNGSTRAND). Whatever made you think that?
Lyngstrand. It was Miss Hilde who let it out. I just looked in here a
little while ago, and I asked the young ladies why they were decorating
the place like this, with flowers and flags.
Ellida. Well?
Lyngstrand. And so Miss Hilde said, "Why, today is mother's birthday."
Ellida. Mother's!--I see.
Arnholm. Aha! (He and ELLIDA exchange a meaning look.) Well, now that
the young man knows about it--
Ellida (to LYNGSTRAND). Well, now that you know--
Lyngstrand (offering her the bouquet again). May I take the liberty of
congratulating you?
Ellida (taking the flowers). My best thanks. Won't you sit down a
moment, Mr. Lyngstrand? (ELLIDA, ARNHOLM, and LYNGSTRAND sit down in
the arbour.) This--birthday business--was to have been kept secret, Mr.
Arnholm.
Arnholm. So I see. It wasn't for us uninitiated folk!
Ellida (putting down the bouquet). Just so. Not for the uninitiated.
Lyngstrand. 'Pon my word, I won't tell a living soul about it.
Ellida. Oh, it wasn't meant like that. But how are you getting on? I
think you look better than you did.
Lyngstrand. Oh! I think I'm getting on famously. And by next year, if I
can go south--
Ellida. And you are going south, the girls tell me.
Lyngstrand. Yes, for I've a benefactor and friend at Bergen, who looks
after me, and has promised to help me next year.
