  GUNNAR (as if beside himself). A sword--an axe! It is the last
message he shall bring!
    (Seizes an axe from the bystanders and rushes out.)
  SIGURD (about to follow). Gunnar, hold thy hand!
  HIORDIS (holding him back). Stay, stay! The men will part them;
I know Gunnar!
    (A cry from the crowd, which has flocked together at the main door.)
  SIGURD AND DAGNY. What is it?
  A VOICE AMONG THE CROWD. Thorolf has fallen.
  SIGURD. Thorolf! Ha, let me go!
  DAGNY. My brother! Oh, my brother!
    (SIGURD is on the point of rushing out. At the same moment, the
      crowd parts, GUNNAR enters, and throws down the axe at the door.)
  GUNNAR. Now it is done. Egil is avenged!
  SIGURD. Well for thee if thy hand has not been too hasty.
  GUNNAR. Mayhap, mayhap; but Egil, Egil, my sweet boy!
  HIORDIS. Now must we arm us, and seek help among our friends; for
Thorolf has many avengers.
  GUNNAR (gloomily). He will be his own worst avenger; he will haunt
me night and day.
  HIORDIS. Thorolf got his reward. Kinsmen must suffer for kinsmen's
deeds.
  GUNNAR. True, true; but this I know, my mind was lighter ere this
befell.
  HIORDIS. This first night[1] is ever the worst;--Ornulf has sought
his revenge by shameful wiles; he would not come against us in open
strife; he feigned to be peacefully-minded; and then he falls upon
our defenceless child! Ha, I saw more clearly than ye; well I deemed
that Ornulf was evil-minded and false; I had good cause to egg thee
on against him and all his faithless tribe!
    [1] Literally the "blood-night."
  GUNNAR (fiercely). That hadst thou! My vengeance is poor beside
Ornulf's crime. He has lost Thorolf, but he has six sons left--
and I have none--none!
  A HOUSE-CARL (enters hastily from the back). Ornulf of the Fiords
is at hand!
  GUNNAR. Ornulf!
  HIORDIS AND SEVERAL MEN. To arms! to arms!
  DAGNY (simultaneously). My father!
  SIGURD (as if seized by a foreboding). Ornulf----! Ah, Gunnar, Gunnar!
  GUNNAR (draws his sword). Up all my men! Vengeance for Egil's death!
    (ORNULF enters, with EGIL in his arms.)
  GUNNAR (with a shriek). Egil!
  ORNULF. Here I bring thee little Egil.
  ALL (one to another). Egil! Egil alive!
  GUNNAR (letting his sword fall). Woe is me! what have I done?
  DAGNY. Oh, Thorolf, my brother!
  SIGURD. I knew it! I knew it!
  ORNULF (setting EGIL down). There, Gunnar, hast thou thy pretty
boy again.
  EGIL. Father! Old Ornulf would not do me ill, as thou saidst when
I went away.
  ORNULF (to HIORDIS). Now have I atoned for thy father; now surely
there may be peace between us.
  HIORDIS (with repressed emotion). Mayhap!
  GUNNAR (as if waking up). Is it a ghastly dream that maddens me!
Thou--thou bringest Egil home!
  ORNULF. As thou seest; but in truth he has been near his death.
  GUNNAR. That I know.
  ORNULF. And hast no more joy in his return?
  GUNNAR. Had he come sooner, I had been glad indeed. But tell me
all that has befallen!
