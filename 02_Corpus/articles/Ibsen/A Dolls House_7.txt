_Rank_. Say it, here he is!
_Nora_ (_hiding the packet_). Hush! Hush! Hush! (HELMER _comes out of
his room, with his coat over his arm and his hat in his hand_.)
_Nora_. Well, Torvald dear, have you got rid of him?
_Helmer_. Yes, he has just gone.
_Nora_. Let me introduce you--this is Christine, who has come to town.
_Helmer_. Christine--? Excuse me, but I don't know--
_Nora_. Mrs. Linde, dear; Christine Linde.
_Helmer_. Of course. A school friend of my wife's, I presume?
_Mrs. Linde_. Yes, we have known each other since then.
_Nora_. And just think, she has taken a long journey in order to see
you.
_Helmer_. What do you mean?
_Mrs. Linde_. No, really, I--
_Nora_. Christine is tremendously clever at book-keeping, and she is
frightfully anxious to work under some clever man, so as to perfect
herself--
_Helmer_. Very sensible, Mrs. Linde.
_Nora_. And when she heard you had been appointed manager of the
Bank--the news was telegraphed, you know--she traveled here as quick as
she could, Torvald, I am sure you will be able to do something for
Christine, for my sake, won't you?
_Helmer_. Well, it is not altogether impossible. I presume you are a
widow, Mrs. Linde?
_Mrs. Linde_. Yes.
_Helmer_. And have had some experience of bookkeeping?
_Mrs. Linde_. Yes, a fair amount.
_Helmer_. Ah! well it's very likely I may be able to find something for
you--
_Nora_ (_clapping her hands_). What did I tell you? What did I tell you?
_Helmer_. You have just come at a fortunate moment, Mrs. Linde.
_Mrs. Linde_. How am I to thank you?
_Helmer_. There is no need. (_Puts on his coat_.) But today you must
excuse me--
_Rank_. Wait a minute; I will come with you. (_Brings his fur coat from
the hall and warms it at the fire_.)
_Nora_. Don't be long away, Torvald dear.
_Helmer_. About an hour, not more.
_Nora_. Are you going too, Christine?
_Mrs. Linde_ (_putting on her cloak_). Yes, I must go and look for a
room.
_Helmer_. Oh, well then, we can walk down the street together.
_Nora_ (_helping her_). What a pity it is we are so short of space here;
I am afraid it is impossible for us--
_Mrs. Linde_. Please don't think of it! Good-bye, Nora dear, and many
thanks.
_Nora_. Good-bye for the present. Of course you will come back this
evening. And you too, Dr. Rank. What do you say? If you are well enough?
Oh, you must be! Wrap yourself up well. (_They go to the door all
talking together. Children's voices are heard on the staircase._)
_Nora_. There they are. There they are! (_She runs to open the door.
The_ NURSE _comes in with the children._) Come in! Come in! (_Stoops and
kisses them._) Oh, you sweet blessings! Look at them, Christine! Aren't
they darlings?
_Rank_. Don't let us stand here in the draught.
_Helmer_. Come along, Mrs. Linde; the place will only be bearable for a
mother now!
