HEDDA.
Are you no surer of him than that?
MRS. ELVSTED.
[Gloomily.] A woman's shadow stands between Eilert Lovborg and me.
HEDDA.
[Looks at her anxiously.] Who can that be?
MRS. ELVSTED.
I don't know. Some one he knew in his--in his past. Some one he has
never been able wholly to forget.
HEDDA.
What has he told you--about this?
MRS. ELVSTED.
He has only once--quite vaguely--alluded to it.
HEDDA.
Well! And what did he say?
MRS. ELVSTED.
He said that when they parted, she threatened to shoot him with a
pistol.
HEDDA.
[With cold composure.] Oh nonsense! No one does that sort of thing here.
MRS. ELVSTED.
No. And that is why I think it must have been that red-haired
singing-woman whom he once--
HEDDA.
Yes, very likely.
MRS. ELVSTED.
For I remember they used to say of her that she carried loaded firearms.
HEDDA.
Oh--then of course it must have been she.
MRS. ELVSTED.
[Wringing her hands.] And now just fancy, Hedda--I hear that this
singing-woman--that she is in town again! Oh, I don't know what to do--
HEDDA.
[Glancing towards the inner room.] Hush! Here comes Tesman. [Rises and
whispers.] Thea--all this must remain between you and me.
MRS. ELVSTED.
[Springing up.] Oh yes--yes! For heaven's sake--!
  GEORGE TESMAN, with a letter in his hand, comes from the right
  through the inner room.
TESMAN.
There now--the epistle is finished.
HEDDA.
That's right. And now Mrs. Elvsted is just going. Wait a moment--I'll
go with you to the garden gate.
TESMAN.
Do you think Berta could post the letter, Hedda dear?
HEDDA.
[Takes it.] I will tell her to.
  BERTA enters from the hall.
BERTA.
Judge Brack wishes to know if Mrs. Tesman will receive him.
HEDDA.
Yes, ask Judge Brack to come in. And look here--put this letter in the
post.
BERTA. [Taking the letter.] Yes, ma'am.
   [She opens the door for JUDGE BRACK and goes out herself.  Brack
       is a main of forty-five; thick set, but well-built and elastic
       in his movements.  His face is roundish with an aristocratic
       profile.  His hair is short, still almost black, and carefully
       dressed.  His eyebrows thick.  His moustaches are also thick,
       with short-cut ends.  He wears a well-cut walking-suit, a
       little too youthful for his age.  He uses an eye-glass, which
       he now and then lets drop.
JUDGE BRACK.
[With his hat in his hand, bowing.] May one venture to call so early in
the day?
HEDDA.
Of course one may.
TESMAN.
[Presses his hand.] You are welcome at any time. [Introducing him.]
Judge Brack--Miss Rysing--
HEDDA.
Oh--!
BRACK.
[Bowing.] Ah--delighted--
HEDDA.
[Looks at him and laughs.] It's nice to have a look at you by daylight,
Judge!
BRACK.
So you find me--altered?
HEDDA.
A little younger, I think.
BRACK.
Thank you so much.
TESMAN.
But what do you think of Hedda--eh? Doesn't she look flourishing? She
has actually--
HEDDA.
Oh, do leave me alone. You haven't thanked Judge Brack for all the
trouble he has taken--
BRACK.
Oh, nonsense--it was a pleasure to me--
