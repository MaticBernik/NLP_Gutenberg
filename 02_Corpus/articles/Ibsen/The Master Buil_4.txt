  Ragnar rises quickly.  He and KAIA come into the work-room.
RAGNAR.
What is the matter, father?
BROVIK.
Give me your arm. Now let us go.
RAGNAR.
Very well. You had better put your things on, too, Kaia.
SOLNESS.
Miss Fosli must stay--just for a moment. There is a letter I want
written.
BROVIK.
[Looks at SOLNESS.] Good night. Sleep well--if you can.
SOLNESS.
Good night.
     [BROVIK and RAGNAR go out by the hall-door.  KAIA goes to the
       desk.  SOLNESS stands with bent head, to the right, by the
       arm-chair.
KAIA.
[Dubiously.] Is there any letter?
SOLNESS.
[Curtly.] No, of course not. [Looks sternly at her.] Kaia!
KAIA.
[Anxiously, in a low voice.] Yes!
SOLNESS.
[Points imperatively to a spot on the floor.] Come here! At once!
KAIA.
[Hesitatingly.] Yes.
SOLNESS.
[As before.] Nearer!
KAIA.
[Obeying.] What do you want with me?
SOLNESS.
[Looks at her for a while.] Is it you I have to thank for all this?
KAIA.
No, no, don't think that!
SOLNESS.
But confess now--you want to get married!
KAIA.
[Softly.] Ragnar and I have been engaged for four or five years, and
so--
SOLNESS.
And so you think it time there were an end of it. Is not that so?
KAIA.
Ragnar and Uncle say I must. So I suppose I shall have to give in.
SOLNESS.
[More gently.] Kaia, don't you really care a little bit for Ragnar, too?
KAIA.
I cared very much for Ragnar once--before I came here to you.
SOLNESS.
But you don't now? Not in the least?
KAIA.
[Passionately, clasping hands and holding them out towards him.] Oh, you
know very well there is only one person I care for now! I shall never
care for any one else.
SOLNESS.
Yes, you say that. And yet you go away from me--leave me alone here with
everything on my hands.
KAIA.
But could I not stay with you, even if Ragnar--?
SOLNESS.
[Repudiating the idea.] No, no, that is quite impossible. If Ragnar
leaves me and starts work on his own account, then of course he will
need you himself.
KAIA.
[Wringing her hands.] Oh, I feel as if I could not be separated from
you! It's quite, quite impossible!
SOLNESS.
Then be sure you get those foolish notions out of Ragnar's head. Marry
him as much as you please--[Alters his tone.] I mean--don't let him
throw up his good situation with me. For then I can keep you too, my
dear Kaia.
KAIA.
Oh yes, how lovely that would be, if it could only be managed!
SOLNESS.
[Clasps her head with his two hands and whispers.] For I cannot get on
without you, you see. I must have you with me every single day.
KAIA.
[In nervous exaltation.] My God! My God!
SOLNESS.
[Kisses her hair.] Kaia--Kaia!
KAIA.
[Sinks down before him.] Oh, how good you are to me! How unspeakably
good you are!
SOLNESS.
[Vehemently.] Get up! For goodness' sake get up! I think I hear some
one.
     [He helps her to rise.  She staggers over to the desk.
