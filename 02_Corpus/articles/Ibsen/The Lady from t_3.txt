Arnholm. Hm. Yes, yes, perhaps you were right.
Ellida. But why didn't you write?
Arnholm (looks at her and smiles, half reproachfully). I make the first
advance? Perhaps expose myself to the suspicion of wanting to begin all
over again? After such a repulse as I had had?
Ellida. Oh no! I understand very well. Have you never since thought of
forming any other tie?
Arnholm. Never! I have been faithful to my first memories.
Ellida (half jestingly). Nonsense! Let the sad old memories alone. You'd
better think of becoming a happy husband, I should say.
Arnholm. I should have to be quick about it, then, Mrs. Wangel.
Remember, I'm already--I'm ashamed to say--I'm past thirty-seven.
Ellida. Well, all the more reason for being quick. (She is silent for
a moment, and then says, earnestly, in a low voice.) But listen, dear
Arnholm; now I am going to tell you something that I could not have told
you then, to save my life.
Arnholm. What is it?
Ellida. When you took the--the useless step you were just speaking of--I
could not answer you otherwise than I did.
Arnholm. I know that you had nothing but friendship to give me; I know
that well enough.
Ellida. But you did not know that all my mind and soul were then given
elsewhere.
Arnholm. At that time!
Ellida. Yes.
Arnholm. But it is impossible. You are mistaken about the time. I hardly
think you knew Wangel then.
Ellida. It is not Wangel of whom I speak.
Arnholm. Not Wangel? But at that time, out there at Skjoldviken--I can't
remember a single person whom I can imagine the possibility of your
caring for.
Ellida. No, no, I quite believe that; for it was all such bewildering
madness--all of it.
Arnholm. But tell me more of this.
Ellida. Oh! it's enough if you know I was bound then; and you know it
now.
Arnholm. And if you had not been bound?
Ellida. Well?
Arnholm. Would your answer to my letter have been different?
Ellida. How can I tell? When Wangel came the answer was different.
Arnholm. What is your object, then, in telling me that you were bound?
Ellida (getting up, as if in fear and unrest). Because I must have
someone in whom to confide. No, no; sit still.
Arnholm. Then your husband knows nothing about this?
Ellida. I confessed to him from the first that my thoughts had once been
elsewhere. He never asked to know more, and we have never touched upon
it since. Besides, at bottom it was simply madness. And then it was over
directly--that is to a certain extent.
Arnholm (rising). Only to a certain extent? Not quite?
Ellida. Yes, yes, it is! Oh, good heavens! Dear Arnholm, it is not what
you think. It is something so absolutely incomprehensible, I don't know
how I could tell it you. You would only think I was ill, or quite mad.
Arnholm. My dearest lady! Now you really must tell me all about it.
