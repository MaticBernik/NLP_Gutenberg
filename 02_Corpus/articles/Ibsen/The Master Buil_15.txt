SOLNESS.
Yes, I do. I deny it altogether!
HILDA.
[Looks scornfully at him.] Oh, indeed!
       [She turns and goes slowly up to the stove, where she remains
       standing motionless, her face averted from him, her hands
       behind her back.  Short pause.
SOLNESS.
[Goes cautiously up behind her.] Miss Wangel--!
HILDA.
[Is silent and does not move.]
SOLNESS.
Don't stand there like a statue. You must have dreamt all this. [Lays
his hand on her arm.] Now just listen--
HILDA.
[Makes an impatient movement with her arm.]
SOLNESS.
[As a thought flashes upon him.] Or--! Wait a moment! There is something
under all this, you may depend!
HILDA.
[Does not move.]
SOLNESS.
[In a low voice, but with emphasis.] I must have thought all that. I
must have wished it--have willed it--have longed to do it. And then--.
May not that be the explanation.
HILDA.
[Is still silent.]
SOLNESS.
[Impatiently.] Oh very well, deuce take it all--then I did do it, I
suppose.
HILDA.
[Turns her head a little, but without looking at him.] Then you admit it
now?
SOLNESS.
Yes--whatever you like.
HILDA.
You came and put your arms round me?
SOLNESS.
Oh yes!
HILDA.
And bent my head back?
SOLNESS.
Very far back.
HILDA.
And kissed me?
SOLNESS.
Yes, I did.
HILDA.
Many times?
SOLNESS.
As many as ever you like.
HILDA.
[Turns quickly toward him and has once more the sparkling expression of
gladness in her eyes.] Well, you see, I got it out of you at last!
SOLNESS.
[With a slight smile.] Yes--just think of my forgetting such a thing as
that.
HILDA.
[Again a little sulky, retreats from him.] Oh, you have kissed so many
people in your time, I suppose.
SOLNESS.
No, you mustn't think that of me. [HILDA seats herself in the arm-chair.
SOLNESS stands and leans against the rocking-chair. Looks observantly at
her.] Miss Wangel!
HILDA.
Yes!
SOLNESS.
How was it now? What came of all this--between us two.
HILDA.
Why, nothing more came of it. You know that quite well. For then the
other guests came in, and then--bah!
SOLNESS.
Quite so! The others came in. To think of my forgetting that too!
HILDA.
Oh, you haven't really forgotten anything: you are only a little ashamed
of it all. I am sure one doesn't forget things of that kind.
SOLNESS.
No, one would suppose not.
HILDA.
[Lively again, looks at him.] Perhaps you have even forgotten what day
it was?
SOLNESS.
What day--?
HILDA.
Yes, on what day did you hang the wreath on the tower? Well? Tell me at
once!
SOLNESS.
H'm--I confess I have forgotten the particular day. I only know it was
ten years ago. Some time in autumn.
HILDA.
[Nods her head slowly several times.] It was ten years ago--on the 19th
of September.
SOLNESS.
Yes, it must have been about that time. Fancy your remembering that too!
[Stops.] But wait a moment--! Yes--it's the 19th of September today.
HILDA.
Yes, it is; and the ten years are gone. And you didn't come--as you had
promised me.
