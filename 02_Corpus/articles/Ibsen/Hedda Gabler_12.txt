HEDDA.
What! Your husband didn't know it!
MRS. ELVSTED.
No, of course not. For that matter, he was away from home himself--
he was travelling. Oh, I could bear it no longer, Hedda! I couldn't
indeed--so utterly alone as I should have been in future.
HEDDA.
Well? And then?
MRS. ELVSTED.
So I put together some of my things--what I needed most--as quietly as
possible. And then I left the house.
HEDDA.
Without a word?
MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes--and took the train to town.
HEDDA.
Why, my dear, good Thea--to think of you daring to do it!
MRS. ELVSTED.
[Rises and moves about the room.] What else could I possibly do?
HEDDA.
But what do you think your husband will say when you go home again?
MRS. ELVSTED.
[At the table, looks at her.] Back to him?
HEDDA.
Of course.
MRS. ELVSTED.
I shall never go back to him again.
HEDDA.
[Rising and going towards her.] Then you have left your home--for good
and all?
MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes. There was nothing else to be done.
HEDDA.
But then--to take flight so openly.
MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh, it's impossible to keep things of that sort secret.
HEDDA.
But what do you think people will say of you, Thea?
MRS. ELVSTED.
They may say what they like, for aught _I_ care. [Seats herself wearily
and sadly on the sofa.] I have done nothing but what I had to do.
HEDDA.
[After a short silence.] And what are your plans now? What do you think
of doing.
MRS. ELVSTED.
I don't know yet. I only know this, that I must live here, where Eilert
Lovborg is--if I am to live at all.
HEDDA.
[Takes a chair from the table, seats herself beside her, and strokes
her hands.] My dear Thea--how did this--this friendship--between you and
Eilert Lovborg come about?
MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh it grew up gradually. I gained a sort of influence over him.
HEDDA.
Indeed?
MRS. ELVSTED.
He gave up his old habits. Not because I asked him to, for I never dared
do that. But of course he saw how repulsive they were to me; and so he
dropped them.
HEDDA.
[Concealing an involuntary smile of scorn.] Then you have reclaimed
him--as the saying goes--my little Thea.
MRS. ELVSTED.
So he says himself, at any rate. And he, on his side, has made a real
human being of me--taught me to think, and to understand so many things.
HEDDA.
Did he give you lessons too, then?
MRS. ELVSTED.
No, not exactly lessons. But he talked to me--talked about such an
infinity of things. And then came the lovely, happy time when I began to
share in his work--when he allowed me to help him!
HEDDA.
Oh he did, did he?
MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes! He never wrote anything without my assistance.
HEDDA.
You were two good comrades, in fact?
MRS. ELVSTED.
[Eagerly.] Comrades! Yes, fancy, Hedda--that is the very word he
used!--Oh, I ought to feel perfectly happy; and yet I cannot; for I
don't know how long it will last.
