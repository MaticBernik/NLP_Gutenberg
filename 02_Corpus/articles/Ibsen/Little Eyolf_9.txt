RITA. Something else, perhaps, that you must not talk openly about as
yet?
BORGHEIM. H'm, that depends--
RITA. But there is nothing to prevent your whispering, you know. [Half
aside.] Asta, you must really go with him.
ASTA. But, my dear Rita--
BORGHEIM. [Imploringly.] Miss Asta--remember it is to be a farewell
walk--the last for many a day.
ASTA. [Takes her hat and parasol.] Very well, suppose we take a stroll
in the garden, then.
BORGHEIM. Oh, thank you, thank you!
ALLMERS. And while you are there you can see what Eyolf is doing.
BORGHEIM. Ah, Eyolf, by the bye! Where is Eyolf to-day? I've got
something for him.
ALLMERS. He is out playing somewhere.
BORGHEIM. Is he really! Then he has begun to play now? He used always to
be sitting indoors over his books.
ALLMERS. There is to be an end of that now. I am going to make a regular
open-air boy of him.
BORGHEIM. Ah, now, that's right! Out into the open air with him, poor
little fellow! Good Lord, what can we possibly do better than play
in this blessed world? For my part, I think all life is one long
playtime!--Come, Miss Asta!
[BORGHEIM and ASTA go out on the verandah and down through the garden.]
ALLMERS. [Stands looking after them.] Rita--do you think there is
anything between those two?
RITA. I don't know what to say. I used to think there was. But Asta has
grown so strange to me--so utterly incomprehensible of late.
ALLMERS. Indeed! Has she? While I have been away?
RITA. Yes, within the last week or two.
ALLMERS. And you think she doesn't care very much about him now?
RITA. Not, seriously; not utterly and entirely; not unreservedly--I am
sure she doesn't. [Looks searchingly at him.] Would it displease you if
she did?
ALLMERS. It would not exactly displease me. But it would certainly be a
disquieting thought--
RITA. Disquieting?
ALLMERS. Yes; you must remember that I am responsible for Asta--for her
life's happiness.
RITA. Oh, come--responsible! Surely Asta has come to years of
discretion? I should say she was capable of choosing for herself.
ALLMERS. Yes, we must hope so, Rita.
RITA. For my part, I don't think at all ill of Borgheim.
ALLMERS. No, dear--no more do I--quite the contrary. But all the same--
RITA. [Continuing.] And I should be very glad indeed if he and Asta were
to make a match of it.
ALLMERS. [Annoyed.] Oh, why should you be?
RITA. [With increasing excitement.] Why, for then she would have to go
far, far away with him! Anal she could never come out here to us, as she
does now.
ALLMERS. [Stares at her in astonishment.] What! Can you really wish Asta
to go away?
RITA. Yes, yes, Alfred!
ALLMERS. Why in all the world--?
RITA. [Throwing her arms passionately round his neck.] For then, at
last, I should have you to myself alone! And yet--not even then!
Not wholly to myself! [Bursts into convulsive weeping.] Oh, Alfred,
Alfred--I cannot give you up!
