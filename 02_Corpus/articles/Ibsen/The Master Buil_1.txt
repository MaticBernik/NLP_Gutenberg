SOLNESS.
[Near the door, points towards the draughtsmen's office, and asks in a
whisper:] Are they gone?
KAIA.
[Softly, shaking her] No.
     [She takes the shade off her eyes.  SOLNESS crosses the room,
       throws his hat on a chair, places the portfolios on the table
       by the sofa, and approaches the desk again.  KAIA goes on
       writing without intermission, but seems nervous and uneasy.
SOLNESS.
[Aloud.] What is that you are entering, Miss Fosli?
KAIA.
[Starts.] Oh, it is only something that--
SOLNESS.
Let me look at it, Miss Fosli. [Bends over her, pretends to be looking
into the ledger, and whispers:] Kaia!
KAIA.
[Softly, still writing.] Well?
SOLNESS.
Why do you always take that shade off when I come?
KAIA.
[As before.] I look so ugly with it on.
SOLNESS.
[Smiling.] Then you don't like to look ugly, Kaia?
KAIA.
[Half glancing up at him.] Not for all the world. Not in your eyes.
SOLNESS.
[Strokes her hair gently.] Poor, poor little Kaia--
KAIA.
[Bending her head.] Hush--they can hear you!
     [SOLNESS strolls across the room to the right, turns and pauses
       at the door of the draughtsmen's office.
SOLNESS.
Has any one been here for me?
RAGNAR.
[Rising.] Yes, the young couple who want a villa built, out at
Lovstrand.
SOLNESS.
[Growling.] Oh, those two! They must wait. I am not quite clear about
the plans yet.
RAGNAR.
[Advancing, with some hesitation.] They were very anxious to have the
drawings at once.
SOLNESS.
[As before.] Yes, of course--so they all are.
BROVIK.
[Looks up.] They say they are longing so to get into a house of their
own.
SOLNESS.
Yes, yes--we know all that! And so they are content to take whatever
is offered them. They get a--a roof over their heads--an address--but
nothing to call a home. No thank you! In that case, let them apply to
somebody else. Tell them that, the next time they call.
BROVIK.
[Pushes his glasses up on to his forehead and looks in astonishment at
him.] To somebody else? Are you prepared to give up the commission?
SOLNESS.
[Impatiently.] Yes, yes, yes, devil take it! If that is to be the way of
it--. Rather that, than build away at random. [Vehemently.] Besides, I
know very little about these people as yet.
BROVIK.
The people are safe enough. Ragnar knows them. He is a friend of the
family.
SOLNESS.
Oh, safe--safe enough! That is not at all what I mean. Good lord--don't
you understand me either? [Angrily.] I won't have anything to do with
these strangers. They may apply to whom they please, so far as I am
concerned.
BROVIK.
[Rising.] Do you really mean that?
SOLNESS.
[Sulkily.] Yes I do.--For once in a way. [He comes forward.
     [BROVIK exchanges a glance with RAGNAR, who makes a warning
       gesture.  Then BROVIK comes into the front room.
BROVIK.
May I have a few words with you?
SOLNESS.
Certainly.
BROVIK.
[To KAIA.] Just go in there for moment, Kaia.
KAIA.
[Uneasily.] Oh, but uncle--
