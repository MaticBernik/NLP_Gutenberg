[He goes away from her and stands in the garden doorway. RITA lies for
some time motionless, with closed eyes.]
RITA. [Suddenly springing up.] But let me tell you one thing, Alfred.
ALLMERS. [Turning in the doorway.] Well?
RITA. You ought not to feel quite so secure as you do!
ALLMERS. Not secure?
RITA. No, you ought not to be so indifferent! Not certain of your
property in me!
ALLMERS. [Drawing nearer.] What do you mean by that?
RITA. [With trembling lips.] Never in a single thought have I been
untrue to you, Alfred! Never for an instant.
ALLMERS. No, Rita, I know that--I, who know you so well.
RITA. [With sparkling eyes.] But if you disdain me--!
ALLMERS. Disdain! I don't understand what you mean!
RITA. Oh, you don't know all that might rise up within me, if--
ALLMERS. If?
RITA. If I should ever see that you did not care for me--that you did
not love me as you used to.
ALLMERS. But, my dearest Rita--years bring a certain change with
them--and that must one day occur even in us--as in every one else.
RITA. Never in me! And I will not hear of any change in you either--I
could not bear it, Alfred. I want to keep you to myself alone.
ALLMERS. [Looking at her with concern.] You have a terribly jealous
nature--
RITA. I can't make myself different from what I am. [Threateningly.] If
you go and divide yourself between me and any one else--
ALLMERS. What then--?
RITA. Then I will take my revenge on you, Alfred!
ALLMERS. How "take your revenge"?
RITA. I don't know how.--Oh yes, I do know, well enough!
ALLMERS. Well?
RITA. I will go and throw myself away--
ALLMERS. Throw yourself away, do you say?
RITA. Yes, that I will. I'll throw myself straight into the arms of of
the first man that comes in my way--
ALLMERS. [Looking tenderly at her and shaking his head.] That you will
never do--my loyal, proud, true-hearted Rita!
RITA. [Putting her arms round his neck.] Oh, you don't know what I might
come to be if you--if you did not love me any more.
ALLMERS. Did not love you, Rita? How can you say such a thing!
RITA. [Half laughing, lets him go.] Why should I not spread my nets for
that--that road-maker man that hangs about here?
ALLMERS. [Relieved.] Oh, thank goodness--you are only joking.
RITA. Not at all. He would do as well as any one else.
ALLMERS. Ah, but I suspect he is more or less taken up already.
RITA. So much the better! For then I should take him away from some one
else; and that is just what Eyolf has done to me.
ALLMERS. Can you say that our little Eyolf has done that?
RITA. [Pointing with her forefinger.] There, you see! You see! The
moment you mention Eyolf's name, you grow tender and your voice quivers!
[Threateningly, clenching her hands.] Oh, you almost tempt we to wish--
