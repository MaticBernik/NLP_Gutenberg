_Maid_ (_coming in with the Tree_). Where shall I put it, ma'am?
_Nora_. Here, in the middle of the floor.
_Maid_. Shall I get you anything else?
_Nora_. No, thank you. I have all I want.
[_Exit_ MAID
_Nora_ (_begins dressing the tree_). A candle here--and flowers here--.
The horrible man! It's all nonsense--there's nothing wrong. The Tree
shall be splendid! I will do everything I can think of to please you,
Torvald!--I will sing for you, dance for you--(HELMER _comes in with
some papers under his arm_.) Oh! are you back already?
_Helmer_. Yes. Has anyone been here?
_Nora_. Here? No.
_Helmer_. That is strange. I saw Krogstad going out of the gate.
_Nora_. Did you? Oh yes, I forgot Krogstad was here for a moment.
_Helmer_. Nora, I can see from your manner that he has been here begging
you to say a good word for him.
_Nora_. Yes.
_Helmer_. And you were to appear to do it of your own accord; you were
to conceal from me the fact of his having been here; didn't he beg that
of you too?
_Nora_. Yes, Torvald, but--
_Helmer_. Nora, Nora, and you would be a party to that sort of thing? To
have any talk with a man like that, and give him any sort of promise?
And to tell me a lie into the bargain?
_Nora_. A lie--?
_Helmer_. Didn't you tell me no one had been here? (_Shakes his finger
at her_.) My little song-bird must never do that again. A song-bird must
have a clean beak to chirp with--no false notes! (_Puts his arm round
her waist._) That is so, isn't it? Yes, I am sure it is. (_Lets her
go_.) We will say no more about it. (_Sits down by the stove_.) How warm
and snug it is here! (_Turns over his papers_.)
_Nora_ (_after a short pause, during which she busies herself with the
Christmas Tree_). Torvald!
_Helmer_. Yes.
_Nora_: I am looking forward tremendously to the fancy dress ball at the
Stensborgs' the day after tomorrow.
_Helmer_. And I am tremendously curious to see what you are going to
surprise me with.
_Nora_. It was very silly of me to want to do that.
_Helmer_. What do you mean?
_Nora_. I can't hit upon anything that will do; everything I think of
seems so silly and insignificant.
_Helmer_. Does my little Nora acknowledge that at last?
_Nora_ (_standing behind his chair with her arms on the back of it_).
Are you very busy, Torvald?
_Helmer_. Well--
_Nora_. What are all those papers?
_Helmer_. Bank business.
_Nora_. Already?
_Helmer_. I have got authority from the retiring manager to undertake
the necessary changes in the staff and in the rearrangement of the work;
and I must make use of the Christmas week for that, so as to have
everything in order for the new year.
_Nora_. Then that was why this poor Krogstad--
_Helmer_. Hm!
_Nora_ (_leans against the back of his chair and strokes his hair_). If
you hadn't been so busy I should have asked you a tremendously big
favour, Torvald.
