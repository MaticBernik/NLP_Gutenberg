HEDDA.
Oh, Tesman! You see, he thinks nothing is so delightful as grubbing
in libraries and making copies of old parchments, or whatever you call
them.
BRACK.
[With a smile of malice.] Well, that is his vocation in life--or part of
it at any rate.
HEDDA.
Yes, of course; and no doubt when it's your vocation--. But _I_! Oh, my
dear Mr. Brack, how mortally bored I have been.
BRACK.
[Sympathetically.] Do you really say so? In downright earnest?
HEDDA.
Yes, you can surely understand it--! To go for six whole months without
meeting a soul that knew anything of our circle, or could talk about
things we were interested in.
BRACK.
Yes, yes--I too should feel that a deprivation.
HEDDA.
And then, what I found most intolerable of all--
BRACK.
Well?
HEDDA.
--was being everlastingly in the company of--one and the same person--
BRACK.
[With a nod of assent.] Morning, noon, and night, yes--at all possible
times and seasons.
HEDDA.
I said "everlastingly."
BRACK.
Just so. But I should have thought, with our excellent Tesman, one
could--
HEDDA.
Tesman is--a specialist, my dear Judge.
BRACK.
Undeniable.
HEDDA.
And specialists are not at all amusing to travel with. Not in the long
run at any rate.
BRACK.
Not even--the specialist one happens to love?
HEDDA.
Faugh--don't use that sickening word!
BRACK.
[Taken aback.] What do you say, Mrs. Hedda?
HEDDA.
[Half laughing, half irritated.] You should just try it! To hear of
nothing but the history of civilisation, morning, noon, and night--
BRACK.
Everlastingly.
HEDDA.
Yes yes yes! And then all this about the domestic industry of the middle
ages--! That's the most disgusting part of it!
BRACK.
[Looks searchingly at her.] But tell me--in that case, how am I to
understand your--? H'm--
HEDDA.
My accepting George Tesman, you mean?
BRACK.
Well, let us put it so.
HEDDA.
Good heavens, do you see anything so wonderful in that?
BRACK.
Yes and no--Mrs. Hedda.
HEDDA.
I had positively danced myself tired, my dear Judge. My day was
done-- [With a slight shudder.] Oh no--I won't say that; nor think
it either!
BRACK.
You have assuredly no reason to.
HEDDA.
Oh, reasons-- [Watching him closely.] And George Tesman--after all, you
must admit that he is correctness itself.
BRACK.
His correctness and respectability are beyond all question.
HEDDA.
And I don't see anything absolutely ridiculous about him.--Do you?
BRACK.
Ridiculous? N--no--I shouldn't exactly say so--
HEDDA.
Well--and his powers of research, at all events, are untiring.--I see no
reason why he should not one day come to the front, after all.
BRACK.
[Looks at her hesitatingly.] I thought that you, like every one else,
expected him to attain the highest distinction.
HEDDA.
[With an expression of fatigue.] Yes, so I did.--And then, since he was
bent, at all hazards, on being allowed to provide for me--I really don't
know why I should not have accepted his offer?
BRACK.
No--if you look at it in that light--
HEDDA.
It was more than my other adorers were prepared to do for me, my dear
Judge.
