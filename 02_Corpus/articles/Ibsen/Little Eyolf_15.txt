ASTA. But we don't in the least know how it really happened.
ALLMERS. Yes, we do. The boys saw her row out over the fiord. They saw
Eyolf standing alone at the very end of the pier. They saw him gazing
after her--and then he seemed to turn giddy. [Quivering.] And that was
how he fell over--and disappeared.
ASTA. Yes, yes. But all the same--
ALLMERS. She has drawn him down into the depths--that you may be sure
of, dear.
ASTA. But, Alfred, why should she?
ALLMERS. Yes, that is just the question! Why should she? There is no
retribution behind it all--no atonement, I mean. Eyolf never did her any
harm. He never called names after her; he never threw stones at her dog.
Why, he had never set eyes either on her or her dog till yesterday.
So there is no retribution; the whole thing is utterly groundless and
meaningless, Asta.--And yet the order of the world requires it.
ASTA. Have you spoken to Rita of these things?
ALLMERS. [Shakes his head.] I feel as if I can talk better to you about
them. [Drawing a deep breath.] And about everything else as well.
[ASTA takes serving-materials and a little paper parcel out of her
pocket. ALLMERS sits looking on absently.]
ALLMERS. What leave you got there, Asta?
ASTA. [Taking his hat.] Some black crap.
ALLMERS. Oh, whet is the use of that?
ASTA. Rita asked me to put it on. May I?
ALLMERS. Oh, yes; as far as I'm concerned--[She sews the crape on his
hat.]
ALLMERS. [Sitting and looking at her.] Where is Rita?
ASTA. She is walking about the garden a little, I think. Borgheim is
with her.
ALLMERS. [Slightly surprised.] Indeed! Is Borgheim out here to-day
again?
ASTA. Yes. He came out by the mid-day train.
ALLMERS. I didn't expect that.
ASTA. [Serving.] He was so fond of Eyolf.
ALLMERS. Borgheim is a faithful soul, Asta.
ASTA. [With quiet warmth.] Yes, faithful he is, indeed. That is certain.
ALLMERS. [Fixing his eyes upon her.] You are really fond of him?
ASTA. Yes, I am.
ALLMERS. And yet you cannot make up your mind to--?
ASTA. [Interrupting.] Oh, my dear Alfred, don't talk of that!
ALLMERS. Yes, yes; tell me why you cannot?
ASTA. Oh, no! Please! You really must not ask me. You see, it's so
painful for me.--There now! The hat is done.
ALLMERS. Thank you.
ASTA. And now for the left arm.
ALLMERS. Am I to have crape on it too?
ASTA. Yes, that is the custom.
ALLMERS. Well--as you please.
[She moves close up to him and begins to sew.]
ASTA. Keep your arm still--then I won't prick you.
ALLMERS. [With a half-smile.] This is like the old days.
ASTA. Yes, don't you think so?
ALLMERS. When you were a little girl you used to sit just like this,
mending my clothes. The first thing you ever sewed for me--that was
black crape, too.
ASTA. Was it?
ALLMERS. Round my student's cap--at the time of father's death.
