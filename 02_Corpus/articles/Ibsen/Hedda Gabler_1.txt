BERTA.
Yes, the young mistress spoke of that too--last night--the moment they
set foot in the house. Is it true then, Miss?
MISS TESMAN.
Yes, indeed it is. Only think, Berta--some foreign university has made
him a doctor--while he has been abroad, you understand. I hadn't heard a
word about it, until he told me himself upon the pier.
BERTA.
Well well, he's clever enough for anything, he is. But I didn't think
he'd have gone in for doctoring people.
MISS TESMAN.
No no, it's not that sort of doctor he is. [Nods significantly.] But
let me tell you, we may have to call him something still grander before
long.
BERTA.
You don't say so! What can that be, Miss?
MISS TESMAN.
[Smiling.] H'm--wouldn't you like to know! [With emotion.] Ah, dear
dear--if my poor brother could only look up from his grave now, and
see what his little boy has grown into! [Looks around.] But bless me,
Berta--why have you done this? Taken the chintz covers off all the
furniture.
BERTA.
The mistress told me to. She can't abide covers on the chairs, she says.
MISS TESMAN.
Are they going to make this their everyday sitting-room then?
BERTA.
Yes, that's what I understood--from the mistress. Master George--the
doctor--he said nothing.
  GEORGE TESMAN comes from the right into the inner room,
  humming to himself, and carrying an unstrapped empty
  portmanteau.  He is a middle-sized, young-looking man of
  thirty-three, rather stout, with a round, open, cheerful
  face, fair hair and beard.  He wears spectacles, and is
  somewhat carelessly dressed in comfortable indoor clothes.
MISS TESMAN.
Good morning, good morning, George.
TESMAN.
[In the doorway between the rooms.] Aunt Julia! Dear Aunt Julia! [Goes
up to her and shakes hands warmly.] Come all this way--so early! Eh?
MISS TESMAN.
Why, of course I had to come and see how you were getting on.
TESMAN.
In spite of your having had no proper night's rest?
MISS TESMAN.
Oh, that makes no difference to me.
TESMAN.
Well, I suppose you got home all right from the pier? Eh?
MISS TESMAN.
Yes, quite safely, thank goodness. Judge Brack was good enough to see me
right to my door.
TESMAN.
We were so sorry we couldn't give you a seat in the carriage. But you
saw what a pile of boxes Hedda had to bring with her.
MISS TESMAN.
Yes, she had certainly plenty of boxes.
BERTA.
[To TESMAN.] Shall I go in and see if there's anything I can do for the
mistress?
TESMAN.
No thank you, Berta--you needn't. She said she would ring if she wanted
anything.
BERTA.
[Going towards the right.] Very well.
TESMAN.
But look here--take this portmanteau with you.
BERTA.
[Taking it.] I'll put it in the attic.
     [She goes out by the hall door.
TESMAN.
Fancy, Auntie--I had the whole of that portmanteau chock full of copies
of the documents. You wouldn't believe how much I have picked up from
all the archives I have been examining--curious old details that no one
has had any idea of--
