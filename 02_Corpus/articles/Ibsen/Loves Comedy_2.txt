SVANHILD [half in jest].
                     Wait till sorrow comes,
And all your being's springtide chills and numbs,
Wait till it gnaws and rends you, soon and late,
Then tell me if my faith is adequate.
       [She goes across to the ladies.
MRS. HALM [aside to her].
Can you two never be at peace? you've made
Poor Mr. Falk quite angry, I'm afraid.
    [Continues reprovingly in a low voice.  MISS JAY joins in
       the conversation.  SVANHILD remains cold and silent.
FALK [after a pause of reflection goes over to the summer-house,
    then to himself].
With fullest confidence her glances lightened.
Shall I believe, as she does so securely,
That Heaven intends--
GULDSTAD.
                     No, hang it; don't be frightened!
The powers above would be demented surely
To give effect to orders such as these.
No, my good sir--the cure for your disease
Is exercise for muscle, nerve, and sinew.
Don't lie there wasting all the grit that's in you
In idle dreams; cut wood, if that were all;
And then I'll say the devil's in't indeed
If one brief fortnight does not find you freed
From all your whimsies high-fantastical.
FALK.
Fetter'd by choice, like Burnell's ass, I ponder--
The flesh on this side, and the spirit yonder.
Which were it wiser I should go for first?
GULDSTAD [filling the glasses].
First have some punch--that quenches ire and thirst.
MRS. HALM [looking at her watch].
Ha!  Eight o'clock! my watch is either fast, or
It's just the time we may expect the Pastor.
     [Rises, and puts things in order on the verandah.
FALK.
What! have we parsons coming?
MISS JAY.
                              Don't you know?
MRS. HALM.
I told you, just a little while ago--
ANNA.
No, mother--Mr. Falk had not yet come.
MRS. HALM.
Why no, that's true; but pray don't look so glum.
Trust me, you'll be enchanted with his visit.
FALK.
A clerical enchanter; pray who is it?
MRS. HALM.
Why, Pastor Strawman, not unknown to fame.
FALK.
Indeed!  Oh, yes, I think I've heard his name,
And read that in the legislative game
He comes to take a hand, with voice and vote.
STIVER.
He speaks superbly.
GULDSTAD.
                  When he's cleared his throat.
MISS JAY.
He's coming with his wife--
MRS. HALM.
                           And all their blessings--
FALK.
To give them three or four days' treat, poor dears--
Soon he'll be buried over head and ears
In Swedish muddles and official messings--
I see!
MRS. HALM [to FALK].
      Now there's a man for you, in truth!
GULDSTAD.
They say he was a rogue, though, in his youth.
MISS JAY [offended].
There, Mr. Guldstad, I must break a lance!
I've heard as long as I can recollect,
Most worthy people speak with great respect
Of Pastor Strawman and his life's romance.
GULDSTAD [laughing].
Romance?
MISS JAY.
         Romance!  I call a match romantic
At which mere worldly wisdom looks askance.
FALK.
You make my curiosity gigantic.
MISS JAY [continuing].
But certain people always grow splenetic--
Why, goodness knows--at everything pathetic,
And scoff it down.  We all know how, of late,
An unfledged, upstart undergraduate
Presumed, with brazen insolence, to declare
That "William Russell"(1)was a poor affair!
