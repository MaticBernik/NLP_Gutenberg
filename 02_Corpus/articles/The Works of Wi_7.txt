    _Tra._ Master, it is no time to chide you now;
    Affection is not rated from the heart:                           155
    If love have touch'd you, nought remains but so,
    'Redime te captum quam queas minimo.'
    _Luc._ Gramercies, lad, go forward; this contents:
    The rest will comfort, for thy counsel's sound.
    _Tra._ Master, you look'd so longly on the maid,                 160
    Perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all.
    _Luc._ O yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,
    Such as the daughter of Agenor had,
    That made great Jove to humble him to her hand,
    When with his knees he kiss'd the Cretan strond.                 165
    _Tra._ Saw you no more? mark'd you not how her sister
    Began to scold and raise up such a storm
    That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?
    _Luc._ Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move
    And with her breath she did perfume the air:                     170
    Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.
    _Tra._ Nay, then, 'tis time to stir him from his trance.
    I pray, awake, sir: if you love the maid,
    Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:
    Her eldest sister is so curst and shrewd                         175
    That till the father rid his hands of her,
    Master, your love must live a maid at home;
    And therefore has he closely mew'd her up,
    Because she will not be annoy'd with suitors.
    _Luc._ Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father's he!                     180
    But art thou not advised, he took some care
    To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?
    _Tra._ Ay, marry, am I, sir; and now 'tis plotted.
    _Luc._ I have it, Tranio.
    _Tra._                    Master, for my hand,
    Both our inventions meet and jump in one.                        185
    _Luc._ Tell me thine first.
    _Tra._                      You will be schoolmaster
    And undertake the teaching of the maid:
    That's your device.
    _Luc._              It is: may it be done?
    _Tra._ Not possible; for who shall bear your part,
    And be in Padua here Vincentio's son;                            190
    Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,
    Visit his countrymen and banquet them?
    _Luc._ Basta; content thee, for I have it full.
    We have not yet been seen in any house,
    Nor can we be distinguish'd by our faces                         195
    For man or master; then it follows thus;
    Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,
    Keep house and port and servants, as I should:
    I will some other be; some Florentine,
    Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa.                          200
    'Tis hatch'd and shall be so: Tranio, at once
    Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak:
    When Biondello comes, he waits on thee;
    But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.
    _Tra._ So had you need.                                          205
    In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is,
    And I am tied to be obedient;
    For so your father charged me at our parting,
    'Be serviceable to my son,' quoth he,
    Although I think 'twas in another sense;                         210
    I am content to be Lucentio,
    Because so well I love Lucentio.
