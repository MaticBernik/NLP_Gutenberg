From this Prince none of the Kings or Government of that Country have
ever seem'd to incline to the hazardous Attempt of the Voyage to the
Moon, at least not in such a hair-brain'd manner.
However, the Engine has been very accurately Re-built and finish'd;
and the People are now oblig'd by a Law, to send up new Feathers
every three Years, to prevent the Mischiefs which happen'd by that
Prince aforesaid, keeping one Set so long that it was dangerous to
venture with them; and thus the Engine is preserved fit for use.
And yet has not this Engine been without its continual Disasters, and
often out of repair; for though the Kings of the Country, as has been
Noted, have done riding on the back of it, yet the restless Courtiers
and Ministers of State have frequently obtained the Management of it,
from the too easy Goodness of their Masters, or the Evils of the
Times.
To Cure this, the Princes frequently chang'd Hands, turn'd one Set of
Men out and put another in: But this made things still worse; for it
divided the People into Parties and Factions in the State, and still
the Strife was, who should ride in this Engine; and no sooner were
these Skaet-Riders got into it, but they were for driving all the
Nation up to the Moon: But of this by it self.
Authors differ concerning the Original of these Feathers, and by what
most exact Hand they were first appointed to this particular use; and
as their Original is hard to be found, so it seems a Difficulty to
resolve from what sort of Bird these Feathers are obtained: Some have
nam'd one, some another; but the most Learned in those Climates call
it by a hard Word, which the Printer having no Letters to express,
and being in that place Hierogliphical, I can translate no better,
than by the Name of a Collective: This must be a Strange Bird without
doubt; it has Heads, Claws, Eyes and Teeth innumerable; and if I
should go about to describe it to you, the History would be so
Romantick, it would spoil the Credit of these more Authentick
Relations which are yet behind.
'Tis sufficient, therefore, for the present, only to leave you this
short Abridgement of the Story, as follows: This great Monstrous
Bird, call'd the Collective, is very seldom seen, and indeed never,
but upon Great Revolutions, and portending terrible Desolations and
Destructions to a Country.
But he frequently sheds his Feathers; and they are carefully pickt
up, by the Proprietors of those Lands where they fall; for none but
those Proprietors may meddle with them; and they no sooner pick them
up but they are sent to Court, where they obtain a new Name, and are
called in a Word equally difficult to pronounce as the other, but
Very like our English Word, Representative; and being placed in their
proper Rows, with the Great Feather in the Center, and fitted for
use, they lately obtained the Venerable Title of, The Consolidators;
and the Machine it self, the Consolidator; and by that Name the
Reader is desir'd for the future to let it be dignified and
distinguish'd.
