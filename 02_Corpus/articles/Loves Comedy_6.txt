SVANHILD.
That would be far beyond a daughter's right--
FALK [laughing].
Hm.  "Svanhild!  Svanhild!"
                      [With sudden gravity.
                With your earliest breath
How came you by this prophecy of death?
SVANHILD.
Is it so grim?
FALK.
            No, lovely as a song,
But for our age too great and stern and strong,
How can a modern demoiselle fill out
The ideal that heroic name expresses?
No, no, discard it with your outworn dresses.
SVANHILD.
You mean the mythical princess, no doubt--
FALK.
Who, guiltless, died beneath the horse's feet.
SVANHILD.
But now such acts are clearly obsolete.
No, no, I'll mount his saddle!  There's my place!
How often have I dreamt, in pensive ease,
He bore me, buoyant, through the world apace,
His mane a flag of freedom in the breeze!
FALK.
Yes, the old tale.  In "pensive ease" no mortal
Is stopped by thwarting bar or cullis'd portal;
Fearless we cleave the ether without bound;
In practice, tho', we shrewdly hug the ground;
For all love life and, having choice, will choose it;
And no man dares to leap where he may lose it.
SVANHILD.
Yes! show me but the end, I'll spurn the shore;
But let the end be worth the leaping for!
A Ballarat beyond the desert sands--
Else each will stay exactly where he stands.
FALK [sarcastically].
I grasp the case;--the due conditions fail.
SVANHILD [eagerly].
Exactly: what's the use of spreading sail
When there is not a breath of wind astir?
FALK [ironically].
Yes, what's the use of plying whip and spur
When there is not a penny of reward
For him who tears him from the festal board,
And mounts, and dashes headlong to perdition?
Such doing for the deed's sake asks a knight,
And knighthood's now an idle superstition.
That was your meaning, possibly?
SVANHILD.
                                 Quite right.
Look at that fruit tree in the orchard close,--
No blossom on its barren branches blows.
You should have seen last year with what brave airs
It staggered underneath its world of pears.
FALK [uncertain].
No doubt, but what's the moral you impute?
SVANHILD [with finesse].
O, among other things, the bold unreason
Of modern Zacharies who seek for fruit.
If the tree blossom'd to excess last season,
You must not crave the blossoms back in this.
FALK.
I knew you'd find your footing in the ways
Of old romance.
SVANHILD.
                Yes, modern virtue is
Of quite another stamp.  Who now arrays
Himself to battle for the truth?  Who'll stake
His life and person fearless for truth's sake?
Where is the hero?
FALK [looking keenly at her].
                   Where is the Valkyria?
SVANHILD [shaking her head].
Valkyrias find no market in this land!
When the faith lately was assailed in Syria,
Did you go out with the crusader-band?
No, but on paper you were warm and willing,--
And sent the "Clerical Gazette" a shilling.
    [Pause.  FALK is about to retort, but checks
      himself, and goes into the garden.
SVANHILD [after watching him a moment, approaches
        him and asks gently:
Falk, are you angry?
