Rosmer. My dear Kroll, I cannot see the matter in that light. It seems
to me that it is my imperative duty to bring a little light and
happiness into the place where the race of Rosmers has spread darkness
and oppression for all these long years.
Kroll (looking severely at him). Yes, that would be a worthy action for
the man with whom the race will disappear. Let such things alone, my
friend. It is no suitable task for you. You were meant to lead the
peaceful life of a student.
Rosmer. Yes, that may be so. But nevertheless I want to try and play my
humble part in the struggles of life.
Kroll. The struggles of life! Do you know what that will mean for you?
It will mean war to the death with all your friends.
Rosmer (quietly). I do not imagine they are all such fanatics as you.
Kroll. You are a simple-minded creature, Rosmer--an inexperienced
creature. You have no suspicion of the violence of the storm that will
burst upon you. (MRS. HELSETH slightly opens the door on the left.)
Mrs. Helseth. Miss West wishes me to ask you, sir
Rosmer. What is it?
Mrs. Helseth. There is some one downstairs that wishes to speak to you
for a minute, sir.
Rosmer. Is it the gentleman that was here yesterday afternoon, by any
chance?
Mrs. Helseth. No, it is that Mr. Mortensgaard.
Rosmer. Mortensgaard?
Kroll. Aha! So matters have got as far as that already, have they!
Rosmer. What does he want with me? Why did you not send him away?
Mrs. Helseth. Miss West told me to ask you if he might come up.
Rosmer. Tell him I am engaged, and--
Kroll (to MRS. HELSETH). No; show him up, please. (MRS. HELSETH goes
out. KROLL takes up his hat.) I quit the field--temporarily. But we
have not fought the decisive action yet.
Rosmer. As truly as I stand here, Kroll, I have absolutely nothing to
do with Mortensgaard.
Kroll. I do not believe you any longer on any point. Under no
circumstances shall I have any faith in you after this. It is war to
the knife now. We shall try if we cannot make you powerless to do any
harm.
Rosmer. Oh, Kroll--how you have sunk! How low you have sunk!
Kroll. I? And a man like you has the face to say so? Remember Beata!
Rosmer. Are you harking back to that again!
Kroll. No. You must solve the riddle of the millrace as your conscience
will allow you--if you have any conscience still left. (PETER
MORTENSGAARD comes in softly and quietly, by the door on the left. He
is a short, slightly built man with sparse reddish hair and beard.
KROLL gives him a look of hatred.) The "Searchlight" too, I see.
Lighted at Rosmersholm! (Buttons up his coat.) That leaves me no doubt
as to the course I should steer.
Mortensgaard (quietly). The "Searchlight" will always be ready burning
to light Mr. Kroll home.
