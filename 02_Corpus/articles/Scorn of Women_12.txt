SITKA CHARLEY
_(Puzzled.)_
I don't know. Womans all crazy.
FREDA
_(Smiling.)_
I think I can explain. Last summer you were in a canoe race on the
river. You paddled very hard, but you lost.
_(Putting hand to heart.)_
And it hurt you--
SITKA CHARLEY
_(Interrupting.)_
Um. Um. Paddle like hell. No win race. _(Stroking first one arm and
then the other.)_ Much tired right here.
_(Putting hand over heart.)_
And um much hurt right here, no tired, just hurt like rheumatism,
because I am sorry I lose race.
_(Nods head repeatedly.)_
Um. Um.
FREDA
The very thing. She doesn't know it, but she is racing against this
Lisznayi woman. Flossie must get here before the other woman steals
her man. And you must help her win the race. Will you?
SITKA CHARLEY
You know this Flossie girl?
FREDA
No.
SITKA CHARLEY
No?
FREDA
Never saw her in my life. But she is coming into a strange country
without a friend or a dollar when she gets here. She will have great
trouble. And you know, Charley, it is not good for a woman to be
without friends or money in this country.
SITKA CHARLEY
_(Puzzled as much as ever.)_
Don't know Flossie girl. No like Vanderlip man. What for you care?...
Much foolishness. All womans crazy.... All right, I help.
_(Mail Carrier has-finished interview with Mrs. Eppingwell, received
gold sack back from Dave Harney, and gone out with mail pouch to left.
Capt. Eppingwell and Loraine Lisznayi have rejoined Mrs. Eppingwell.)_
_(Loraine Lisznayi says good-by to them, and starts to make exit to
right, passing close to Freda and Sitka Charley. She pauses one or two
paces away.)_
LORAINE
_(Favoring Freda with a quick but sweeping, scornful glance.)_
Come here, Charley. I want to speak to you a moment.
_(Her conduct angers Sitka Charley, who grows stolid and refuses to
move or reply.)_
FREDA
Speak with her, Charley.
SITKA CHARLEY
_(Sullenly.)_
No speak.
_(Loraine Lisznayi, scornful expression on face, proceeds on her way,
and makes exit to right.)_
FREDA
Why didn't you, Charley?
SITKA CHARLEY
_(Angrily.)_
What for she look at you that way?
FREDA
_(Ignoring the question.)_
They say she is a rich woman in her own country. But I don't believe
it. I think she is after Vanderlip's money.
SITKA CHARLEY
Lisznayi woman no got money. I know. I sell her dogs--eight hundred
dollars. She pay me three hundred. Two weeks, three weeks, I no get
other five hundred dollars. Um no got five hundred. I say, "My dogs,
give me back." She give back. Me have fur robe. Good fur robe. She
buy, two hundred dollar. Um no pay. Um have good fur robe. Me no have
nothing. Um have cabin. Um no pay rent to Johnson. Um smile very nice,
um Johnson wait. I know, I see. Um dogs she got now, Vanderlip give,
make present. Um no pay firewood. Um no pay many things.
FREDA
I thought so. And now to win the race. Dogs first of all. Flossie must
be brought in to-night. I want you here in Dawson, Charley. So you
must send some Indian up the trail with a fresh team of dogs. Flossie
camps at Mooseback tonight. He is to let her think that Vanderlip has
sent the dogs, and that Vanderlip wants her to come right on to-night.
Understand?
