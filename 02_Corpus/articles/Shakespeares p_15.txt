ACT III.
SCENE I.--SALOON OF THE CASKETS IN PORTIA'S HOUSE AT BELMONT.
_Enter_ NERISSA, _with_ SERVANTS.
_Ner_. The prince of Arragon hath ta'en his oath,
And comes to his election presently.
_Flourish of Trumpets. Enter the_ PRINCE OF ARRAGON, PORTIA, _and their
Trains_.
_Por_. Behold, there stand the caskets, noble prince;
If you choose that wherein I am contain'd,
Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemniz'd;
But if you fail, without more speech, my lord,
You must be gone from hence immediately.
_Arr_. I am enjoin'd by oath to observe three things:
First, never to unfold to any one
Which casket 'twas I chose; next, if I fail
Of the right casket, never in my life
To woo a maid in way of marriage; lastly,
If I do fail in fortune of my choice,
Immediately to leave you and be gone.
_Por_. To these injunctions every one doth swear
That comes to hazard for my worthless self.
_Arr_. And so have I address'd me:[72] Fortune now
To my heart's hope!--Gold, silver, and base lead.
    'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
What says the golden chest? ha! let me see:
    'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'
What many men desire.--That many may be meant[73]
By the fool multitude,[74] that choose by show,
Why, then, to thee, thou silver treasure-house;
Tell me once more what title thou dost bear:
    'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves;'
And well said too. For who shall go about
To cozen fortune, and be honourable
Without the stamp of merit!
O, that estates, degrees, and offices,
Were not deriv'd corruptly! and that clear honour
Were purchas'd by the merit of the wearer!
How many then should cover that stand bare?
How many be commanded that command?
And how much honour
Pick'd from the chaff and ruin of the times,
To be new varnish'd? Well, but to my choice:
