SOLNESS.
[Looks at him and rises.] Oho!
DR. HERDAL.
Now don't be offended--but hasn't she?
SOLNESS.
[With curt decision.] No.
DR. HERDAL.
No reason of any sort?
SOLNESS.
No other than her own suspicious nature.
DR. HERDAL.
I know you have known a good many women in your time.
SOLNESS.
Yes, I have.
DR. HERDAL.
And have been a good deal taken with some of them, too.
SOLNESS.
Oh yes, I don't deny it.
DR. HERDAL.
But as regards Miss Fosli, then? There is nothing of that sort in this
case?
SOLNESS.
No; nothing at all--on my side.
DR. HERDAL.
But on her side?
SOLNESS.
I don't think you have any right to ask that question, doctor.
DR. HERDAL.
Well, you know, we were discussing your wife's intuition.
SOLNESS.
So we were. And for that matter--[lowers his voice]--Aline's intuition,
as you call it--in a certain sense, it has not been so far astray.
DR. HERDAL.
Aha! there we have it!
SOLNESS.
[Sits down.] Doctor Herdal--I am going to tell you a strange story--if
you care to listen to it.
DR. HERDAL.
I like listening to strange stories.
SOLNESS.
Very well then. I daresay you recollect that I took Knut Brovik and his
son into my employment--after the old man's business had gone to the
dogs.
DR. HERDAL.
Yes, so I have understood.
SOLNESS.
You see, they really are clever fellows, these two. Each of them has
talent in his own way. But then the son took it into his head to get
engaged; and the next thing, of course, was that he wanted to get
married--and begin to build on his own account. That is the way with all
these young people.
DR. HERDAL.
[Laughing.] Yes, they have a bad habit of wanting to marry.
SOLNESS.
Just so. But of course that did not suit my plans; for I needed Ragnar
myself--and the old man too. He is exceedingly good at calculating
bearing strains and cubic contents--and all that sort of devilry, you
know.
DR. HERDAL.
Oh yes, no doubt that's indispensable.
SOLNESS.
Yes, it is. But Ragnar was absolutely bent on setting to work for
himself. He would hear of nothing else.
DR. HERDAL.
But he has stayed with you all the same.
SOLNESS.
Yes, I'll tell you how that came about. One day this girl, Kaia Fosli,
came to see them on some errand or other. She had never been here
before. And when I saw how utterly infatuated they were with each other,
the thought occurred to me: if I cold only get her into the office here,
then perhaps Ragnar too would stay where he is.
DR. HERDAL.
That was not at all a bad idea.
SOLNESS.
Yes, but at the time I did not breathe a word of what was in my mind.
I merely stood and looked at her--and kept on wishing intently that
I could have her here. Then I talked to her a little, in a friendly
way--about one thing and another. And then she went away.
