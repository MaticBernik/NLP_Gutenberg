CHIEF JUSTICE.
Well God mend him! I pray you, let me speak with you.
FALSTAFF.
This apoplexy is, as I take it, a kind of lethargy, an 't please
your lordship; a kind of sleeping in the blood, a whoreson tingling.
CHIEF JUSTICE.
What tell you me of it? be it as it is.
FALSTAFF.
It hath it original from much grief, from study and perturbation
of the brain:  I have read the cause of his effects in Galen:
it is a kind of deafness.
CHIEF JUSTICE.
I think you are fallen into the disease, for you hear not
what I say to you.
FALSTAFF.
Very well, my lord, very well:  rather, an 't please you, it
is the disease of not listening, the malady of not marking, that
I am troubled withal.
CHIEF JUSTICE.
To punish you by the heels would amend the attention
of your ears; and I care not if I do become your physician.
FALSTAFF.
I am as poor as Job, my lord, but not so patient:  your lordship
may minister the potion of imprisonment to me in respect of poverty;
but how I should be your patient to follow your prescriptions,
the wise may make some dram of a scruple, or indeed a scruple itself.
CHIEF JUSTICE.
I sent for you, when there were matters against you
for your life, to come speak with me.
FALSTAFF.
As I was then advised by my learned counsel in the laws
of this land-service, I did not come.
CHIEF JUSTICE.
Well, the truth is, Sir John, you live in great infamy.
FALSTAFF.
He that buckles himself in my belt cannot live in less.
CHIEF JUSTICE.
Your means are very slender, and your waste is great.
FALSTAFF.
I would it were otherwise; I would my means were greater,
and my waist slenderer.
CHIEF JUSTICE.
You have misled the youthful prince.
FALSTAFF.
The young prince hath misled me:  I am the fellow with the
great belly, and he my dog.
CHIEF JUSTICE.
Well, I am loath to gall a new-healed wound:  your day's service
at Shrewsbury hath a little gilded over your night's exploit
on Gad's-hill:  you may thank the unquiet time for your quiet
o'er-posting that action.
FALSTAFF.
My lord?
CHIEF JUSTICE.
But since all is well, keep it so: wake not a sleeping wolf.
FALSTAFF.
To wake a wolf is as bad as smell a fox.
CHIEF JUSTICE.
What! you are as a candle, the better part burnt out.
FALSTAFF.
A wassail candle, my lord, all tallow:  if I did say of wax, my
growth would approve the truth.
CHIEF JUSTICE.
There is not a white hair in your face but should have his
effect of gravity.
FALSTAFF.
His effect of gravy, gravy, gravy.
CHIEF JUSTICE.
You follow the young prince up and down, like his ill angel.
FALSTAFF.
Not so, my lord; your ill angel is light; but I hope he that looks
upon me will take me without weighing:  and yet, in some respects,
I grant, I cannot go:  I cannot tell. Virtue is of so little regard
in these costermonger times that true valour is turned bear-herd;
pregnancy is made a tapster, and hath his quick wit wasted in giving
reckonings:  all the other gifts appertinent to man, as the malice of
this age shapes them, are not worth a gooseberry. You that are old
consider not the capacities of us that are young; you do measure the
heat of our livers with the bitterness of your galls:  and we that
are in the vaward of our youth, I must confess, are wags too.
