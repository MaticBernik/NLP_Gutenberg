DUCHESS
   I did not think
   I should be ever loved: do you indeed
   Love me so much as now you say you do?
GUIDO
   Ask of the sea-bird if it loves the sea,
   Ask of the roses if they love the rain,
   Ask of the little lark, that will not sing
   Till day break, if it loves to see the day:
   And yet, these are but empty images,
   Mere shadows of my love, which is a fire
   So great that all the waters of the main
   Can not avail to quench it.  Will you not speak?
DUCHESS
   I hardly know what I should say to you.
GUIDO
   Will you not say you love me?
DUCHESS
   Is that my lesson?
   Must I say all at once?  Twere a good lesson
   If I did love you, sir; but, if I do not,
   What shall I say then?
GUIDO
   If you do not love me,
   Say, none the less, you do, for on your tongue
   Falsehood for very shame would turn to truth.
DUCHESS
   What if I do not speak at all?  They say
   Lovers are happiest when they are in doubt
GUIDO
   Nay, doubt would kill me, and if I must die,
   Why, let me die for joy and not for doubt.
   Oh, tell me may I stay, or must I go?
DUCHESS
   I would not have you either stay or go;
   For if you stay you steal my love from me,
   And if you go you take my love away.
   Guido, though all the morning stars could sing
   They could not tell the measure of my love.
   I love you, Guido.
GUIDO [_stretching out his hands_]
   Oh, do not cease at all;
   I thought the nightingale sang but at night;
   Or if thou needst must cease, then let my lips
   Touch the sweet lips that can such music make.
DUCHESS
   To touch my lips is not to touch my heart.
GUIDO
   Do you close that against me?
DUCHESS
   Alas! my lord,
   I have it not: the first day that I saw you
   I let you take my heart away from me;
   Unwilling thief, that without meaning it
   Did break into my fenced treasury
   And filch my jewel from it!  O strange theft,
   Which made you richer though you knew it not,
   And left me poorer, and yet glad of it!
GUIDO [_clasping her in his arms_]
   O love, love, love!  Nay, sweet, lift up your head,
   Let me unlock those little scarlet doors
   That shut in music, let me dive for coral
   In your red lips, and Ill bear back a prize
   Richer than all the gold the Gryphon guards
   In rude Armenia.
DUCHESS
   You are my lord,
   And what I have is yours, and what I have not
   Your fancy lends me, like a prodigal
   Spending its wealth on what is nothing worth.
                                                           [_Kisses him_.]
GUIDO
   Methinks I am bold to look upon you thus:
   The gentle violet hides beneath its leaf
   And is afraid to look at the great sun
   For fear of too much splendour, but my eyes,
   O daring eyes! are grown so venturous
   That like fixed stars they stand, gazing at you,
   And surfeit sense with beauty.
