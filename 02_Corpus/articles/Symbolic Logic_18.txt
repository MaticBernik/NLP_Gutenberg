Let us take, next, the Proposition "No xy exist".
This tells us that there is _nothing_ in the North-West Cell; that is,
that the North-West Cell is _empty_. And this we can represent by
placing a _Grey_ Counter in it.

    [In the "books" example, this Proposition would be "No old
    English books exist".]
Similarly we may represent the three similar Propositions "No xy'
exist", "No x'y exist", and "No x'y' exist".
    [The Reader should make out all these for himself. In the
    "books" example, these three Propositions would be "No old
    foreign books exist", &c.]
                                                                   pg030
We have seen that the Proposition "No x exist" may be represented by
placing _two Grey_ Counters in the North Half, one in each Cell.

We have also seen that these two _Grey_ Counters, taken _separately_,
represent the two Propositions "No xy exist" and "No xy' exist".
Hence we see that the Proposition "No x exist" is a _Double_
Proposition, and is equivalent to the _two_ Propositions "No xy exist"
and "No xy' exist".
    [In the "books" example, this Proposition would be "No old books
    exist".
    Hence this is a _Double_ Proposition, and is equivalent to the
    _two_ Propositions "No old _English_ books exist" and "No old
    _foreign_ books exist".]

_Representation of Propositions of Relation._
Let us take, first, the Proposition "Some x are y".
This tells us that at least _one_ Thing, in the _North_ Half, is also in
the _West_ Half. Hence it must be in the space _common_ to them, that
is, in the _North-West Cell_. Hence the North-West Cell is _occupied_.
And this we can represent by placing a _Red_ Counter in it.
    .-------.

    [Note that the _Subject_ of the Proposition settles which _Half_
    we are to use; and that the _Predicate_ settles in which
    _portion_ of it we are to place the Red Counter.
    In the "books" example, this Proposition would be "Some old
    books are English".]
Similarly we may represent the three similar Propositions "Some x are
y'", "Some x' are y", and "Some x' are y'".
    [The Reader should make out all these for himself. In the
    "books" example, these three Propositions would be "Some old
    books are foreign", &c.]
                                                                   pg031
Let us take, next, the Proposition "Some y are x".
This tells us that at least _one_ Thing, in the _West_ Half, is also in
the _North_ Half. Hence it must be in the space _common_ to them, that
is, in the _North-West Cell_. Hence the North-West Cell is _occupied_.
And this we can represent by placing a _Red_ Counter in it.

Similarly we may represent the three similar Propositions "Some y are
x'", "Some y' are x", and "Some y' are x'".
    [The Reader should make out all these for himself. In the
    "books" example, these three Propositions would be "Some English
    books are new", &c.]
