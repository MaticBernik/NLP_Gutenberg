SCENE I. _A Lane by the Wall of Capulet's Orchard_
_Enter_ ROMEO
  _Romeo._ Can I go forward when my heart is here?--
  Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
                   [_He climbs the wall, and leaps down within it._
_Enter_ BENVOLIO _and_ MERCUTIO
  _Benvolio._ Romeo! my cousin Romeo! Romeo!
  _Mercutio._                                He is wise,
  And, on my life, hath stolen him home to bed.
  _Benvolio._ He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall;
  Call, good Mercutio.
  _Mercutio._          Nay, I'll conjure too.--
  Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
  Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh!
  Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
  Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove';                 10
  Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
  One nickname for her purblind son and heir,
  Young Abraham Cupid, he that shot so trim
  When King Cophetua lov'd the beggar-maid!--
  He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
  The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.--
  I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,
  By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
  That in thy likeness thou appear to us!
  _Benvolio._ An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.              20
  _Mercutio._ This cannot anger him; 'twould anger him
  To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
  Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
  Till she had laid it and conjur'd it down.
  That were some spite; my invocation
  Is fair and honest, and in his mistress' name
  I conjure only but to raise up him.
  _Benvolio._ Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,
  To be consorted with the humorous night;
  Blind is his love and best befits the dark.                       30
  _Mercutio._ If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.--
  Romeo, good night.--I'll to my truckle-bed;
  This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
  Come, shall we go?
  _Benvolio._         Go, then; for 'tis in vain
  To seek him here that means not to be found.           [_Exeunt._
SCENE II. _Capulet's Orchard_
_Enter_ ROMEO
  _Romeo._ He jests at scars that never felt a wound.--
                               [_Juliet appears above at a window._
  But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
  It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.--
  Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
  Who is already sick and pale with grief
  That thou her maid art far more fair than she.
  Be not her maid, since she is envious.
  Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
  And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.--
  It is my lady, O, it is my love!                                  10
  O, that she knew she were!--
  She speaks, yet she says nothing; what of that?
  Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
  I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks.
  Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
  Having some business, do entreat her eyes
  To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
  What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
  The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
  As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven                       20
  Would through the airy region stream so bright
  That birds would sing and think it were not night.
  See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
  O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
  That I might touch that cheek!
