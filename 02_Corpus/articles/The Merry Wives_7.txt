ACT II.
SCENE I. _Before PAGE'S house._
  _Enter MISTRESS PAGE, with a letter._
  [Transcriber's Note:
  In order to preserve the marked line breaks without losing
  readability, each line of the quoted letter has been split into
  two equal halves.]
_Mrs Page._ What, have I scaped love-letters in the
holiday-time of my beauty, and am I now a subject for
them? Let me see.    [_Reads:_
  'Ask me no reason why I love you;
  for though Love use Reason
  for his physician, he admits him
  not for his counsellor. You are                                    5
  not young, no more am I; go to,
  then, there's sympathy: you are
  merry, so am I; ha, ha! then there's
  more sympathy: you love sack,
  and so do I; would you desire better
  sympathy? Let it suffice thee,
  Mistress Page,--at the least, if the
  love of soldier can suffice,--that
  I love thee. I will not say, pity
  me,--'tis not a soldier-like phrase;                              10
  but I say, love me. By me,
    Thine own true knight,
    By day or night,
    Or any kind of light,
    With all his might                                              15
    For thee to fight,     JOHN FALSTAFF.'
What a Herod of Jewry is this! O wicked, wicked world!
One that is well-nigh worn to pieces with age to show himself
a young gallant! What an unweighed behaviour hath
this Flemish drunkard picked--with the devil's name!--out           20
of my conversation, that he dares in this manner assay me?
Why, he hath not been thrice in my company! What
should I say to him? I was then frugal of my mirth:
Heaven forgive me! Why, I'll exhibit a bill in the
parliament for the putting down of men. How shall I be revenged     25
on him? for revenged I will be, as sure as his guts
are made of puddings.
  _Enter MISTRESS FORD._
_Mrs Ford._ Mistress Page! trust me, I was going to
your house.
_Mrs Page._ And, trust me, I was coming to you. You                 30
look very ill.
_Mrs Ford._ Nay, I'll ne'er believe that; I have to show
to the contrary.
_Mrs Page._ Faith, but you do, in my mind.
_Mrs Ford._ Well, I do, then; yet, I say, I could show              35
you to the contrary. O Mistress Page, give me some
counsel!
_Mrs Page._ What's the matter, woman?
_Mrs Ford._ O woman, if it were not for one trifling respect,
I could come to such honour!                                        40
_Mrs Page._ Hang the trifle, woman! take the honour.
What is it?--dispense with trifles;--what is it?
_Mrs Ford._ If I would but go to hell for an eternal
moment or so, I could be knighted.
_Mrs Page._ What? thou liest! Sir Alice Ford! These                 45
knights will hack; and so thou shouldst not alter the article
of thy gentry.
_Mrs Ford._ We burn daylight:--here, read, read; perceive
how I might be knighted. I shall think the worse of
fat men, as long as I have an eye to make difference of             50
men's liking: and yet he would not swear; praised women's
modesty; and gave such orderly and well-behaved reproof
to all uncomeliness, that I would have sworn his disposition
would have gone to the truth of his words; but they do no
more adhere and keep place together than the Hundredth              55
Psalm to the tune of 'Green Sleeves.' What tempest, I
trow, threw this whale, with so many tuns of oil in his
belly, ashore at Windsor? How shall I be revenged on
him? I think the best way were to entertain him with
hope, till the wicked fire of lust have melted him in his own       60
grease. Did you ever hear the like?
