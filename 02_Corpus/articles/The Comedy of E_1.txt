ACT II.
_SCENE I. The house of _ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus_._
  _Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA._
_Adr._ Neither my husband nor the slave return'd,
That in such haste I sent to seek his master!
Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.
_Luc._ Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,
And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner.                     5
Good sister, let us dine, and never fret:
A man is master of his liberty:
Time is their master; and when they see time,
They'll go or come: if so, be patient, sister.
_Adr._ Why should their liberty than ours be more?                  10
_Luc._ Because their business still lies out o' door.
_Adr._ Look, when I serve him so, he takes it ill.
_Luc._ O, know he is the bridle of your will.
_Adr._ There's none but asses will be bridled so.
_Luc._ Why, headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe.                  15
There's nothing situate under heaven's eye
But hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky:
The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls,
Are their males' subjects and at their controls:
Men, more divine, the masters of all these,                         20
Lords of the wide world and wild watery seas,
Indued with intellectual sense and souls,
Of more pre-eminence than fish and fowls,
Are masters to their females, and their lords:
Then let your will attend on their accords.                         25
_Adr._ This servitude makes you to keep unwed.
_Luc._ Not this, but troubles of the marriage-bed.
_Adr._ But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.
_Luc._ Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.
_Adr._ How if your husband start some other where?                  30
_Luc._ Till he come home again, I would forbear.
_Adr._ Patience unmoved! no marvel though she pause;
They can be meek that have no other cause.
A wretched soul, bruised with adversity,
We bid be quiet when we hear it cry;                                35
But were we burden'd with like weight of pain,
As much, or more, we should ourselves complain:
So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,
With urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me;
But, if thou live to see like right bereft,                         40
This fool-begg'd patience in thee will be left.
_Luc._ Well, I will marry one day, but to try.
Here comes your man; now is your husband nigh.
  _Enter _DROMIO of Ephesus_._
_Adr._ Say, is your tardy master now at hand?
_Dro. E._ Nay, he's at two hands with me, and that my               45
two ears can witness.
_Adr._ Say, didst thou speak with him? know'st thou his mind?
_Dro. E._ Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear:
Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it.
_Luc._ Spake he so doubtfully, thou couldst not feel his            50
meaning?
_Dro. E._ Nay, he struck so plainly, I could too well
feel his blows; and withal so doubtfully, that I could scarce
understand them.
_Adr._ But say, I prithee, is he coming home?                       55
It seems he hath great care to please his wife.
