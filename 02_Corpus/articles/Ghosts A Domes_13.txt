Mrs. Alving. I had another very good reason. I did not wish Oswald, my
own son, to inherit a penny that belonged to his father.
Manders. Then it is with Mr. Alving's property.
Mrs. Alving. Yes. The sums of money that, year after year, I have given
towards this Orphanage, make up the amount of property--I have reckoned
it carefully--which in the old days made Lieutenant Alving a catch.
Manders. I understand.
Mrs. Alving. That was my purchase money. I don't wish it to pass into
Oswald's hands. My son shall have everything from me, I am determined.
(OSWALD comes in by the farther door on the right. He has left his hat
and coat outside.)
Mrs. Alving. Back again, my own dear boy?
Oswald. Yes, what can one do outside in this everlasting rain? I hear
dinner is nearly ready. That's good!
(REGINA comes in front the dining-room, carrying a parcel.)
Regina. This parcel has come for you, ma'am. (Gives it to her.)
Mrs. Alving (glancing at MANDERS). The ode to be sung tomorrow, I
expect.
Manders. Hm--!
Regina. And dinner is ready.
Mrs. Alving. Good. We will come in a moment. I will just--(begins to
open the parcel).
Regina (to OSWALD). Will you drink white or red wine, sir?
Oswald. Both, Miss Engstrand.
Regina. Bien--very good, Mr. Alving. (Goes into the dining-room.)
Oswald. I may as well help you to uncork it--. (Follows her into the
dining-room, leaving the door ajar after him.)
Mrs. Alving. Yes, I thought so. Here is the ode, Mr Manders.
Manders (clasping his hands). How shall I ever have the courage
tomorrow to speak the address that--
Mrs. Alving. Oh, you will get through it.
Manders (in a low voice, fearing to be heard in the dining room). Yes,
we must raise no suspicions.
Mrs. Alving (quietly but firmly). No; and then this long dreadful
comedy will be at an end. After tomorrow, I shall feel as if my dead
husband had never lived in this house. There will be no one else here
then but my boy and his mother.
(From the dining-room is heard the noise of a chair falling; then
REGINA'S voice is heard in a loud whisper: Oswald! Are you mad? Let me
go!)
Mrs. Alving (starting in horror). Oh--!
(She stares wildly at the half-open door. OSWALD is heard coughing and
humming, then the sound of a bottle being uncorked.)
Manders (in an agitated manner). What's the matter? What is it, Mrs.
Alving?
Mrs. Alving (hoarsely). Ghosts. The couple in the conservatory--over
again.
Manders. What are you saying! Regina--? Is SHE--!
Mrs. Alving. Yes, Come. Not a word--!
(Grips MANDERS by the arm and walks unsteadily with him into the
dining-room.)
ACT II
(The same scene. The landscape is still obscured by Mist. MANDERS and
MRS. ALVING come in from the dining-room.)
Mrs. Alving (calls into the dining-room from the doorway). Aren't you
coming in here, Oswald?
Oswald. No, thanks; I think I will go out for a bit.
