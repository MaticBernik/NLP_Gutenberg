We had, to our great good fortune, one sailor among us, who had been
assistant to the cook; he told us, that he would find a way how to
preserve our beef without cask or pickle; and this he did effectually
by curing it in the sun, with the help of saltpetre, of which there was
great plenty in the island; so that, before we found any method for our
escape, we had dried the flesh of six or seven cows and bullocks,
and ten or twelve goats, and it relished so well, that we never gave
ourselves the trouble to boil it when we ate it, but either broiled it
or ate it dry. But our main difficulty about fresh water still remained;
for we had no vessel to put any into, much less to keep any for our
going to sea.
But our first voyage being only to coast the island, we resolved to
venture, whatever the hazard or consequence of it might be, and in order
to preserve as much fresh water as we could, our carpenter made a well
athwart the middle of one of our canoes, which he separated from the
other parts of the canoe, so as to make it tight to hold the water and
covered so as we might step upon it; and this was so large that it held
near a hogshead of water very well. I cannot better describe this well
than by the same kind which the small fishing-boats in England have to
preserve their fish alive in; only that this, instead of having holes to
let the salt water in, was made sound every way to keep it out; and it
was the first invention, I believe, of its kind for such an use; but
necessity is a spur to ingenuity and the mother of invention.
It wanted but a little consultation to resolve now upon our voyage. The
first design was only to coast it round the island, as well to see if we
could seize upon any vessel fit to embark ourselves in, as also to take
hold of any opportunity which might present for our passing over to the
main; and therefore our resolution was to go on the inside or west shore
of the island, where, at least at one point, the land stretching a great
way to the north-west, the distance is not extraordinary great from the
island to the coast of Africa.
Such a voyage, and with such a desperate crew, I believe was never made,
for it is certain we took the worst side of the island to look for any
shipping, especially for shipping of other nations, this being quite out
of the way; however, we put to sea, after taking all our provisions and
ammunition, bag and baggage, on board; we had made both mast and sail
for our two large periaguas, and the other we paddled along as well as
we could; but when a gale sprung up, we took her in tow.
