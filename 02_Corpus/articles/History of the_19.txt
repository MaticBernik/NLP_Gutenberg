This shutting up of the houses was a method first taken, as I
understand, in the plague which happened in 1603, at the coming of King
James I. to the crown; and the power of shutting people up in their own
houses was granted by act of Parliament, entitled "An Act for the
Charitable Relief and Ordering of Persons Infected with Plague." On
which act of Parliament the lord mayor and aldermen of the city of
London founded the order they made at this time, and which took place
the 1st of July, 1665, when the numbers of infected within the city
were but few; the last bill for the ninety-two parishes being but four,
and some houses having been shut up in the city, and some people being
removed to the pesthouse beyond Bunhill Fields, in the way to Islington.
I say by these means, when there died near one thousand a week in the
whole, the number in the city was but twenty-eight; and the city was
preserved more healthy, in proportion, than any other place all the time
of the infection.
These orders of my lord mayor's were published, as I have said, the
latter end of June, and took place from the 1st of July, and were as
follow: viz.,--
     ORDERS CONCEIVED AND PUBLISHED BY THE LORD MAYOR AND ALDERMEN OF
     THE CITY OF LONDON, CONCERNING THE INFECTION OF THE PLAGUE; 1665.
     Whereas in the reign of our late sovereign King James, of happy
     memory, an act was made for the charitable relief and ordering of
     persons infected with the plague; whereby authority was given to
     justices of the peace, mayors, bailiffs, and other head officers,
     to appoint within their several limits examiners, searchers,
     watchmen, keepers, and buriers, for the persons and places
     infected, and to minister unto them oaths for the performance of
     their offices; and the same statute did also authorize the giving
     of their directions as unto them for other present necessity should
     seem good in their discretions: it is now, upon special
     consideration, thought very expedient, for preventing and avoiding
     of infection of sickness (if it shall please Almighty God), that
     these officers following be appointed, and these orders hereafter
     duly observed.
     _Examiners to be appointed to every Parish._
     First, it is thought requisite, and so ordered, that in every
     parish there be one, two, or more persons of good sort and credit
     chosen by the alderman, his deputy, and common council of every
     ward, by the name of examiners, to continue in that office for the
     space of two months at least: and if any fit person so appointed
     shall refuse to undertake the same, the said parties so refusing to
     be committed to prison until they shall conform themselves
     accordingly.
     _The Examiner's Office._
     That these examiners be sworn by the aldermen to inquire and learn
     from time to time what houses in every parish be visited, and what
     persons be sick, and of what diseases, as near as they can inform
     themselves, and, upon doubt in that case, to command restraint of
     access until it appear what the disease shall prove; and if they
     find any person sick of the infection, to give order to the
     constable that the house be shut up; and, if the constable shall be
     found remiss and negligent, to give notice thereof to the alderman
     of the ward.
