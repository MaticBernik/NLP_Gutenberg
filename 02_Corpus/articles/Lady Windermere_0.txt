DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Isnt he dreadful?  Agatha, this is Lord Darlington.
Mind you dont believe a word he says.  [LORD DARLINGTON _crosses R.C._]
No, no tea, thank you, dear.  [_Crosses and sits on sofa_.]  We have just
had tea at Lady Markbys.  Such bad tea, too.  It was quite undrinkable.
I wasnt at all surprised.  Her own son-in-law supplies it.  Agatha is
looking forward so much to your ball to-night, dear Margaret.
LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Seated L.C._]  Oh, you mustnt think it is going to
be a ball, Duchess.  It is only a dance in honour of my birthday.  A
small and early.
LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Standing L.C._]  Very small, very early, and very
select, Duchess.
DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  [_On sofa L._]  Of course its going to be select.
But we know _that_, dear Margaret, about _your_ house.  It is really one
of the few houses in London where I can take Agatha, and where I feel
perfectly secure about dear Berwick.  I dont know what society is coming
to.  The most dreadful people seem to go everywhere.  They certainly come
to my partiesthe men get quite furious if one doesnt ask them.  Really,
some one should make a stand against it.
LADY WINDERMERE.  _I_ will, Duchess.  I will have no one in my house
about whom there is any scandal.
LORD DARLINGTON.  [_R.C._]  Oh, dont say that, Lady Windermere.  I
should never be admitted!  [_Sitting_.]
DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Oh, men dont matter.  With women it is different.
Were good.  Some of us are, at least.  But we are positively getting
elbowed into the corner.  Our husbands would really forget our existence
if we didnt nag at them from time to time, just to remind them that we
have a perfect legal right to do so.
LORD DARLINGTON.  Its a curious thing, Duchess, about the game of
marriagea game, by the way, that is going out of fashionthe wives hold
all the honours, and invariably lose the odd trick.
DUCHESS OF BERWICK.   The odd trick?  Is that the husband, Lord
Darlington?
LORD DARLINGTON.  It would be rather a good name for the modern husband.
DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Dear Lord Darlington, how thoroughly depraved you
are!
LADY WINDERMERE.  Lord Darlington is trivial.
LORD DARLINGTON.  Ah, dont say that, Lady Windermere.
LADY WINDERMERE.  Why do you _talk_ so trivially about life, then?
LORD DARLINGTON.  Because I think that life is far too important a thing
ever to talk seriously about it.  [_Moves up C._]
DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  What does he mean?  Do, as a concession to my poor
wits, Lord Darlington, just explain to me what you really mean.
LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Coming down back of table_.]  I think I had better
not, Duchess.  Nowadays to be intelligible is to be found out.  Good-bye!
[_Shakes hands with_ DUCHESS.]  And now[_goes up stage_] Lady
Windermere, good-bye.  I may come to-night, maynt I?  Do let me come.
LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Standing up stage with_ LORD DARLINGTON.]  Yes,
certainly.  But you are not to say foolish, insincere things to people.
