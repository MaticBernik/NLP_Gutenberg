_Froth._ I thank your worship. For mine own part, I
never come into any room in a taphouse, but I am drawn in.
_Escal._ Well, no more of it, Master Froth: farewell.
[_Exit Froth._] Come you hither to me, Master tapster.
What's your name, Master tapster?                                  200
_Pom._ Pompey.
_Escal._ What else?
_Pom._ Bum, sir.
_Escal._ Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about
you; so that, in the beastliest sense, you are Pompey the          205
Great. Pompey, you are partly a bawd, Pompey, howsoever
you colour it in being a tapster, are you not? come,
tell me true: it shall be the better for you.
_Pom._ Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live.
_Escal._ How would you live, Pompey? by being a                    210
bawd? What do you think of the trade, Pompey? is it a
lawful trade?
_Pom._ If the law would allow it, sir.
_Escal._ But the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it
shall not be allowed in Vienna.                                    215
_Pom._ Does your worship mean to geld and splay all
the youth of the city?
_Escal._ No, Pompey.
_Pom._ Truly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to't,
then. If your worship will take order for the drabs and            220
the knaves, you need not to fear the bawds.
_Escal._ There are pretty orders beginning, I can tell
you: it is but heading and hanging.
_Pom._ If you head and hang all that offend that way
but for ten year together,
        you'll be glad to give out a commission                    225
for more heads: if this law hold in Vienna ten year,
I'll rent the fairest house in it after three-pence a bay: if
you live to see this come to pass, say Pompey told you so.
_Escal._ Thank you, good Pompey; and, in requital of
your prophecy, hark you: I advise you, let me not find             230
you before me again upon any complaint whatsoever; no,
not for dwelling where you do: if I do, Pompey, I shall
beat you to your tent, and prove a shrewd Caesar to you;
in plain dealing, Pompey, I shall have you whipt: so, for
this time, Pompey, fare you well.                                  235
_Pom._ I thank your worship for your good counsel:
[_Aside_] but I shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shall
better determine.
Whip me? No, no; let carman whip his jade:
The valiant heart is not whipt out of his trade.    [_Exit._       240
_Escal._ Come hither to me, Master Elbow; come hither,
Master constable. How long have you been in this place
of constable?
_Elb._ Seven year and a half, sir.
_Escal._ I thought, by your readiness in the office, you had       245
continued in it some time. You say, seven years together?
_Elb._ And a half, sir.
_Escal._ Alas, it hath been great pains to you. They
do you wrong to put you so oft upon't: are there not men
in your ward sufficient to serve it?                               250
_Elb._ Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters: as
they are chosen, they are glad to choose me for them; I
do it for some piece of money, and go through with all.
