HILDA.
[More seriously.] Yes, of course it was then we met.
SOLNESS.
Well, that is a long time ago.
HILDA.
[Looks hard at him.] It is exactly ten years.
SOLNESS.
You must have been a mere child then, I should think.
HILDA.
[Carelessly.] Well, I was twelve or thirteen.
DR. HERDAL.
Is this the first time you have ever been up to town, Miss Wangel?
HILDA.
Yes, it is indeed.
SOLNESS.
And don't you know any one here?
HILDA.
Nobody but you. And of course, your wife.
SOLNESS.
So you know her, too?
HILDA.
Only a little. We spent a few days together at the sanatorium.
SOLNESS.
Ah, up there?
HILDA.
She said I might come and pay her a visit if ever I came up to town.
[Smiles.] Not that that was necessary.
SOLNESS.
Odd that she should never have mentioned it.
     [HILDA puts her stick down by the stove, takes off the knapsack
       and lays it and the plaid on the sofa.  DR. HERDAL offers to
       help her.  SOLNESS stands and gazes at her.
HILDA.
[Going towards him.] Well, now I must ask you to let me stay the night
here.
SOLNESS.
I am sure there will be no difficulty about that.
HILDA.
For I have no other clothes than those I stand in, except a change of
linen in my knapsack. And that has to go to the wash, for it's very
dirty.
SOLNESS.
Oh yes, that can be managed. Now I'll just let my wife know--
DR. HERDAL.
Meanwhile I will go and see my patient.
SOLNESS.
Yes, do; and come again later on.
DR. HERDAL.
[Playfully, with a glance at HILDA.] Oh that I will, you may be very
certain! [Laughs.] So your prediction has come true, Mr. Solness!
SOLNESS.
How so?
DR. HERDAL.
The younger generation did come knocking at your door.
SOLNESS.
[Cheerfully.] Yes, but in a very different way from what I meant.
DR. HERDAL.
Very different, yes. That's undeniable.
     [He goes out by the hall-door.  SOLNESS opens the door on the
       right and speaks into the side room.
SOLNESS.
Aline! Will you come in here, please. Here is a friend of yours--Miss
Wangel.
MRS. SOLNESS.
[Appears in the doorway.] Who do you say it is? [Sees HILDA.]. Oh, is it
you, Miss Wangel?
SOLNESS.
Miss Wangel has this moment arrived; and she would like to stay the
night here.
MRS. SOLNESS.
Here with us? Oh yes, certainly.
SOLNESS.
Till she can get her things a little in order, you know.
MRS. SOLNESS.
I will do the best I can for you. It's no more than my duty. I suppose
your trunk is coming on later?
HILDA.
I have no trunk.
MRS. SOLNESS.
Well, it will be all right, I daresay. In the meantime, you must excuse
my leaving you here with my husband, until I can get a room made a
little more comfortable for you.
SOLNESS.
Can we not give her one of the nurseries? They are all ready as it is.
