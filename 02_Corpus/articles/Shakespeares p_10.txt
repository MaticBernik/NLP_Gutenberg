_Lau_. It should seem, then, that Dobbin's tail grows backward; I am
sure he had more hair of his tail than I have of my face, when I last
saw him.
_Gob_. Lord, how art thou changed! How dost thou and thy master agree? I
have brought him a present.
_Lau. (rises.)_ Give him a present! give him a halter: I am famished in
his service; you may tell every finger I have with my ribs. Father, I am
glad you are come: give me your present to one master Bassanio, who,
indeed, gives rare new liveries; if I serve not him, I will run as far
as Heaven has any ground.--O rare fortune! here comes the man;--to him,
father; for I am a Jew if I serve the Jew any longer.
_Enter_ BASSANIO, _with_ LEONARDO, _and_ STEPHANO.
_Bas_. See these letters deliver'd; put the liveries to making; and
desire Gratiano to come anon to my lodging.
[_Exit a_ SERVANT.
_Lau_. To him, father.
_Gob_. Heaven bless your worship!
_Bas_. Gramercy! Would'st thou aught with me?
_Gob_. Here's my son, sir, a poor boy--
_Lau_. Not a poor boy, sir; but the rich Jew's man; that would, sir, as
my father shall specify.
_Gob_. He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serve----
_Lau_. Indeed, the short and the long is, I serve the Jew, and have a
desire as my father shall specify.
_Gob_. His master and he (saving your worship's reverence) are scarce
cater-cousins.
_Lau_. To be brief, the very truth is, that the Jew having done me
wrong, doth cause me, as my father, being I hope an old man, shall
frutify unto you.
_Gob_. I have here a dish of doves, that I would bestow upon your
worship; and my suit is----
_Lau_. In very brief, the suit is impertinent[51] to myself, as your
worship shall know by this honest old man; and, though I say it, though
old man, yet poor man, my father.
_Bas_. One speak for both. What would you?
_Lau_. Serve you, sir.
_Gob_. That is the very defect of the matter, sir.
_Bas_. I know thee well; thou hast obtain'd thy suit:
Shylock, thy master, spoke with me this day,
And hath preferr'd thee, if it be preferment,
To leave a rich Jew's service, to become
The follower of so poor a gentleman.
_Lau_. The old proverb is very well parted between my master, Shylock,
and you, sir; you have the grace of Heaven, sir, and he hath---- enough.
_Bas_. Thou speak'st it well. Go, father, with thy son:--
Take leave of thy old master, and inquire
My lodging out:--give him a livery.  [_To his Followers_.
More guarded[52] than his fellows': See it done.
_Lau_. Father, in:--_(Exit_ OLD GOBBO.) I cannot get a service, no!--I
have ne'er a tongue in my head!--Well; (_looking on his palm_) if any
man in Italy have a fairer table;[53] which doth offer to swear upon a
book I shall have good fortune![54] Go to, here's a simple line of
life![55] here's a small trifle of wives: Alas, fifteen wives is
nothing; eleven widows and nine maids, is a simple coming in for one
man: and then, to 'scape drowning thrice; and to be in peril of my life
with the edge of a feather-bed,[56] here are simple 'scapes! Well, if
fortune be a woman she's a good wench for this gear.--I'll take my leave
of the Jew in the twinkling of an eye.
