O.M. The old father's comforts were now curtailed?
Y.M. Quite seriously. Yes.
O.M. The sister's music-lessens had to stop?
Y.M. Yes.
O.M. The young brother's education--well, an extinguishing blight fell
upon that happy dream, and he had to go to sawing wood to support the
old father, or something like that?
Y.M. It is about what happened. Yes.
O.M. What a handsome job of self-sacrificing he did do! It seems to me
that he sacrificed everybody _except_ himself. Haven't I told you that
no man _ever_ sacrifices himself; that there is no instance of it upon
record anywhere; and that when a man's Interior Monarch requires a thing
of its slave for either its _momentary_ or its _permanent_ contentment,
that thing must and will be furnished and that command obeyed, no matter
who may stand in the way and suffer disaster by it? That man _ruined his
family_ to please and content his Interior Monarch--
Y.M. And help Christ's cause.
O.M. Yes--_secondly_. Not firstly. _He_ thought it was firstly.
Y.M. Very well, have it so, if you will. But it could be that he argued
that if he saved a hundred souls in New York--
O.M. The sacrifice of the _family_ would be justified by that great
profit upon the--the--what shall we call it?
Y.M. Investment?
O.M. Hardly. How would _speculation_ do? How would _gamble_ do? Not
a solitary soul-capture was sure. He played for a possible
thirty-three-hundred-per-cent profit. It was _gambling_--with his
family for "chips." However let us see how the game came out. Maybe we
can get on the track of the secret original impulse, the _real_ impulse,
that moved him to so nobly self--sacrifice his family in the Savior's
cause under the superstition that he was sacrificing himself. I will
read a chapter or so.... Here we have it! It was bound to expose itself
sooner or later. He preached to the East-Side rabble a season, then went
back to his old dull, obscure life in the lumber-camps "_hurt to the
heart, his pride humbled_." Why? Were not his efforts acceptable to the
Savior, for Whom alone they were made? Dear me, that detail is _lost
sight of_, is not even referred to, the fact that it started out as a
motive is entirely forgotten! Then what is the trouble? The authoress
quite innocently and unconsciously gives the whole business away. The
trouble was this: this man merely _preached_ to the poor; that is not
the University Settlement's way; it deals in larger and better things
than that, and it did not enthuse over that crude Salvation-Army
eloquence. It was courteous to Holme--but cool. It did not pet him,
did not take him to its bosom. "_Perished were all his dreams of
distinction, the praise and grateful approval_--" Of whom? The
Savior? No; the Savior is not mentioned. Of whom, then? Of "his
_fellow-workers_." Why did he want that? Because the Master inside of
him wanted it, and would not be content without it. That emphasized
sentence quoted above, reveals the secret we have been seeking, the
original impulse, the _real_ impulse, which moved the obscure and
unappreciated Adirondack lumberman to sacrifice his family and go on
that crusade to the East Side--which said original impulse was this,
to wit: without knowing it _he went there to show a neglected world the
large talent that was in him, and rise to distinction_. As I have warned
you before, _no_ act springs from any but the one law, the one motive.
But I pray you, do not accept this law upon my say-so; but diligently
examine for yourself. Whenever you read of a self-sacrificing act or
hear of one, or of a duty done for _duty's sake_, take it to pieces and
look for the _real_ motive. It is always there.
