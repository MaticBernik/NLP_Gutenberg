    _Page._ Ay, and the time seems thirty unto me,
    Being all this time abandon'd from your bed.
    _Sly._ 'Tis much. Servants, leave me and her alone.
    Madam, undress you and come now to bed.                          115
    _Page._ Thrice-noble lord, let me entreat of you
    To pardon me yet for a night or two;
    Or, if not so, until the sun be set:
    For your physicians have expressly charged,
    In peril to incur your former malady,                            120
    That I should yet absent me from your bed:
    I hope this reason stands for my excuse.
    _Sly._ Ay, it stands so that I may hardly tarry so long.
    But I would be loath to fall into my dreams again: I will
    therefore tarry in despite of the flesh and the blood.           125
_Enter a_ Messenger.
    _Mess._ Your honour's players, hearing your amendment,
    Are come to play a pleasant comedy;
    For so your doctors hold it very meet,
    Seeing too much sadness hath congeal'd your blood,
    And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy:                           130
    Therefore they thought it good you hear a play
    And frame your mind to mirth and merriment.
    Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life.
    _Sly._ Marry, I will, let them play it. Is not a comonty
    a Christmas gambold or a tumbling-trick?                         135
    _Page._ No, my good lord; it is more pleasing stuff.
    _Sly._ What, household stuff?
    _Page._ It is a kind of history.
    _Sly._ Well, we'll see't. Come, madam wife, sit by my
    side and let the world slip: we shall ne'er be younger.          140
    _Flourish._
