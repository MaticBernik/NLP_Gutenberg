_Mrs Page._ Letter for letter, but that the name of
Page and Ford differs! To thy great comfort in this mystery
of ill opinions, here's the twin-brother of thy letter:
but let thine inherit first; for, I protest, mine never shall.      65
I warrant he hath a thousand of these letters, writ with
blank space for different names,--sure, more,--and these
are of the second edition: he will print them, out of doubt;
for he cares not what he puts into the press, when he would
put us two. I had rather be a giantess, and lie under               70
Mount Pelion. Well, I will find you twenty lascivious turtles
ere one chaste man.
_Mrs Ford._ Why, this is the very same; the very hand,
the very words. What doth he think of us?
_Mrs Page._ Nay, I know not: it makes me almost                     75
ready to wrangle with mine own honesty. I'll entertain
myself like one that I am not acquainted withal; for, sure,
unless he know some strain in me, that I know not myself,
he would never have boarded me in this fury.
_Mrs Ford._ 'Boarding,' call you it? I'll be sure to keep           80
him above deck.
_Mrs Page._ So will I: if he come under my hatches,
I'll never to sea again. Let's be revenged on him: let's
appoint him a meeting; give him a show of comfort in his
suit, and lead him on with a fine-baited delay, till he hath        85
pawned his horses to mine host of the Garter.
_Mrs Ford._ Nay, I will consent to act any villany
against him, that may not sully the chariness of our honesty.
O, that my husband saw this letter! it would give
eternal food to his jealousy.                                       90
_Mrs Page._ Why, look where he comes; and my
good man too: he's as far from jealousy as I am from
giving him cause; and that, I hope, is an unmeasurable
distance.
_Mrs Ford._ You are the happier woman.                              95
_Mrs Page._ Let's consult together against this greasy
knight. Come hither.    [_They retire._
  _Enter FORD, with PISTOL, and PAGE, with NYM._
_Ford._ Well, I hope it be not so.
_Pist._ Hope is a curtal dog in some affairs:
Sir John affects thy wife.                                         100
_Ford._ Why, sir, my wife is not young.
_Pist._ He wooes both high and low, both rich and poor,
Both young and old, one with another, Ford;
He loves the gallimaufry: Ford, perpend.
_Ford._ Love my wife!                                              105
_Pist._ With liver burning hot. Prevent, or go thou,
Like Sir Actaeon he, with Ringwood at thy heels:
O, odious is the name!
_Ford._ What name, sir?
_Pist._ The horn, I say. Farewell.                                 110
Take heed; have open eye; for thieves do foot by night:
Take heed, ere summer comes, or cuckoo-birds do sing.
Away, Sir Corporal Nym!--
Believe it, Page; he speaks sense.    [_Exit._
_Ford._ [_Aside_] I will be patient; I will find out this.         115
_Nym._ [_To Page_] And this is true; I like not the humour
of lying. He hath wronged me in some humours:
I should have borne the humoured letter to her; but I
have a sword, and it shall bite upon my necessity. He
loves your wife; there's the short and the long. My name           120
is Corporal Nym; I speak, and I avouch; 'tis true: my
name is Nym, and Falstaff loves your wife. Adieu. I
love not the humour of bread and cheese [and there's the
humour of it]. Adieu.    [_Exit._
