MENAS.
All men's faces are true, whatsome'er their hands are.
ENOBARBUS.
But there is never a fair woman has a true face.
MENAS.
No slander; they steal hearts.
ENOBARBUS.
We came hither to fight with you.
MENAS.
For my part, I am sorry it is turn'd to a drinking. Pompey doth
this day laugh away his fortune.
ENOBARBUS.
If he do, sure he cannot weep it back again.
MENAS.
You have said, sir. We look'd not for Mark Antony here: pray you,
is he married to Cleopatra?
ENOBARBUS.
Caesar's sister is called Octavia.
MENAS.
True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.
ENOBARBUS.
But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.
MENAS.
Pray you, sir?
ENOBARBUS.
'Tis true.
MENAS.
Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.
ENOBARBUS.
If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would not prophesy so.
MENAS.
I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than
the love of the parties.
ENOBARBUS.
I think so too. But you shall find the band that seems to tie
their friendship together will be the very strangler of their
amity:  Octavia is of a holy, cold, and still conversation.
MENAS.
Who would not have his wife so?
ENOBARBUS.
Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony. He will to
his Egyptian dish again: then shall the sighs of Octavia blow the
fire up in Caesar; and, as I said before, that which is the
strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their
variance. Antony will use his affection where it is: he married
but his occasion here.
MENAS.
And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard? I have a health
for you.
ENOBARBUS.
I shall take it, sir: we have used our throats in Egypt.
MENAS.
Come, let's away.
[Exeunt.]
SCENE VII. On board POMPEY'S Galley, lying near Misenum.
[Music. Enter two or three SERVANTS with a banquet.]
FIRST SERVANT.
Here they'll be, man. Some o' their plants are ill-rooted
already; the least wind i' the world will blow them down.
SECOND SERVANT.
Lepidus is high-coloured.
FIRST SERVANT.
They have made him drink alms-drink.
SECOND SERVANT.
As they pinch one another by the disposition, he cries out 'no
more'; reconciles them to his entreaty and himself to the drink.
FIRST SERVANT.
But it raises the greater war between him and his discretion.
SECOND SERVANT.
Why, this it is to have a name in great men's fellowship: I had
as lief have a reed that will do me no service as a partizan I
could not heave.
FIRST SERVANT.
To be called into a huge sphere, and not to be seen to move in't,
are the holes where eyes should be, which pitifully disaster the
cheeks.
[A sennet sounded. Enter CAESAR, ANTONY, LEPIDUS, POMPEY,
AGRIPPA, MAECENAS, ENOBARBUS, MENAS, with other Captains.]
ANTONY.
[To CAESAR.] Thus do they, sir: they take the flow o' the Nile
By certain scales i' the pyramid; they know
By the height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearth
Or foison follow: the higher Nilus swells
The more it promises; as it ebbs, the seedsman
Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,
And shortly comes to harvest.
