    _Gre._ You are too blunt: go to it orderly.                       45
    _Pet._ You wrong me, Signior Gremio: give me leave.
    I am a gentleman of Verona, sir,
    That, hearing of her beauty and her wit,
    Her affability and bashful modesty,
    Her wondrous qualities and mild behaviour,                        50
    Am bold to show myself a forward guest
    Within your house, to make mine eye the witness
    Of that report which I so oft have heard.
    And, for an entrance to my entertainment,
    I do present you with a man of mine,                              55
                                        [_Presenting Hortensio._
    Cunning in music and the mathematics,
    To instruct her fully in those sciences,
    Whereof I know she is not ignorant:
    Accept of him, or else you do me wrong:
    His name is Licio, born in Mantua.                                60
    _Bap._ You're welcome, sir; and he, for your good sake.
    But for my daughter Katharine, this I know,
    She is not for your turn, the more my grief.
    _Pet._ I see you do not mean to part with her,
    Or else you like not of my company.                               65
    _Bap._ Mistake me not; I speak but as I find.
    Whence are you, sir? what may I call your name?
    _Pet._ Petruchio is my name; Antonio's son,
    A man well known throughout all Italy.
    _Bap._ I know him well: you are welcome for his sake.             70
    _Gre._ Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray,
    Let us, that are poor petitioners, speak too:
    Baccare! you are marvellous forward.
    _Pet._ O, pardon me, Signior Gremio; I would fain be doing.
    _Gre._ I doubt it not, sir; but you will curse your wooing.       75
    Neighbour, this is a gift very grateful, I am sure of it. To
    express the like kindness, myself, that have been more
    kindly beholding to you than any, freely give unto you
    this young scholar [_presenting Lucentio_], that hath been
    long studying at Rheims; as cunning in Greek, Latin, and          80
    other languages, as the other in music and mathematics:
    his name is Cambio; pray, accept his service.
    _Bap._ A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio. Welcome,
    good Cambio. But, gentle sir [_to Tranio_], methinks you
    walk like a stranger: may I be so bold to know the cause          85
    of your coming?
    _Tra._ Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own;
    That, being a stranger in this city here,
    Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,
    Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.                                   90
    Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me,
    In the preferment of the eldest sister.
    This liberty is all that I request,
    That, upon knowledge of my parentage,
    I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo                      95
    And free access and favour as the rest:
    And, toward the education of your daughters,
    I here bestow a simple instrument,
    And this small packet of Greek and Latin books:
    If you accept them, then their worth is great.                   100
    _Bap._ Lucentio is your name; of whence, I pray?
    _Tra._ Of Pisa, sir; son to Vincentio.
    _Bap._ A mighty man of Pisa; by report
    I know him well: you are very welcome, sir.
    Take you the lute, and you the set of books;                     105
    You shall go see your pupils presently.
    Holla, within!
