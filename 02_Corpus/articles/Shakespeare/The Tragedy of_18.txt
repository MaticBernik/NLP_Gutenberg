[Exeunt.]
CORIOLANUS.
Worthy voices!
[Re-enter MENENIUS, with BRUTUS and SICINIUS.]
MENENIUS.
You have stood your limitation; and the tribunes
Endue you with the people's voice:--remains
That, in the official marks invested, you
Anon do meet the senate.
CORIOLANUS.
Is this done?
SICINIUS.
The custom of request you have discharg'd:
The people do admit you; and are summon'd
To meet anon, upon your approbation.
CORIOLANUS.
Where? at the senate-house?
SICINIUS.
There, Coriolanus.
CORIOLANUS.
May I change these garments?
SICINIUS.
You may, sir.
CORIOLANUS.
That I'll straight do; and, knowing myself again,
Repair to the senate-house.
MENENIUS.
I'll keep you company.--Will you along?
BRUTUS.
We stay here for the people.
SICINIUS.
Fare you well.
[Exeunt CORIOLANUS and MENENIUS.]
He has it now; and by his looks methinks
'Tis warm at his heart.
BRUTUS.
With a proud heart he wore his humble weeds.
Will you dismiss the people?
[Re-enter citizens.]
SICINIUS.
How now, my masters! have you chose this man?
FIRST CITIZEN.
He has our voices, sir.
BRUTUS.
We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.
SECOND CITIZEN.
Amen, sir:--to my poor unworthy notice,
He mocked us when he begg'd our voices.
THIRD CITIZEN.
Certainly;
He flouted us downright.
FIRST CITIZEN.
No, 'tis his kind of speech,--he did not mock us.
SECOND CITIZEN.
Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
He us'd us scornfully: he should have show'd us
His marks of merit, wounds received for's country.
SICINIUS.
Why, so he did, I am sure.
CITIZENS.
No, no; no man saw 'em.
THIRD CITIZEN.
He said he had wounds, which he could show in private;
And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,
'I would be consul,' says he; 'aged custom
But by your voices, will not so permit me;
Your voices therefore:' when we granted that,
Here was, 'I thank you for your voices,--thank you,--
Your most sweet voices:--now you have left your voices
I have no further with you:'--was not this mockery?
SICINIUS.
Why either were you ignorant to see't?
Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness
To yield your voices?
BRUTUS.
Could you not have told him,
As you were lesson'd,--when he had no power,
But was a petty servant to the state,
He was your enemy; ever spake against
Your liberties, and the charters that you bear
I' the body of the weal: and now, arriving
A place of potency and sway o' the state,
If he should still malignantly remain
Fast foe to the plebeii, your voices might
Be curses to yourselves? You should have said,
That as his worthy deeds did claim no less
Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature
Would think upon you for your voices, and
Translate his malice towards you into love,
Standing your friendly lord.
SICINIUS.
Thus to have said,
As you were fore-advis'd, had touch'd his spirit
And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd
Either his gracious promise, which you might,
As cause had call'd you up, have held him to;
Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature,
Which easily endures not article
Tying him to aught; so, putting him to rage,
You should have ta'en the advantage of his choler
And pass'd him unelected.
