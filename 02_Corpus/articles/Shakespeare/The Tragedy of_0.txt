MARCIUS.
They have a leader,
Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to't.
I sin in envying his nobility;
And were I anything but what I am,
I would wish me only he.
COMINIUS.
You have fought together.
MARCIUS.
Were half to half the world by the ears, and he
Upon my party, I'd revolt, to make
Only my wars with him: he is a lion
That I am proud to hunt.
FIRST SENATOR.
Then, worthy Marcius,
Attend upon Cominius to these wars.
COMINIUS.
It is your former promise.
MARCIUS.
Sir, it is;
And I am constant.--Titus Lartius, thou
Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.
What, art thou stiff? stand'st out?
TITUS LARTIUS.
No, Caius Marcius;
I'll lean upon one crutch and fight with the other
Ere stay behind this business.
MENENIUS.
O, true bred!
FIRST SENATOR.
Your company to the Capitol; where, I know,
Our greatest friends attend us.
TITUS LARTIUS.
Lead you on.
Follow, Cominius; we must follow you;
Right worthy your priority.
COMINIUS.
Noble Marcius!
FIRST SENATOR.
Hence to your homes; be gone!
[To the Citizens.]
MARCIUS.
Nay, let them follow:
The Volsces have much corn; take these rats thither
To gnaw their garners.--Worshipful mutineers,
Your valour puts well forth: pray follow.
[Exeunt Senators, COM., MAR, TIT., and MENEN. Citizens steal
away.]
SICINIUS.
Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?
BRUTUS.
He has no equal.
SICINIUS.
When we were chosen tribunes for the people,--
BRUTUS.
Mark'd you his lip and eyes?
SICINIUS.
Nay, but his taunts!
BRUTUS.
Being mov'd, he will not spare to gird the gods.
SICINIUS.
Bemock the modest moon.
BRUTUS.
The present wars devour him: he is grown
Too proud to be so valiant.
SICINIUS.
Such a nature,
Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow
Which he treads on at noon: but I do wonder
His insolence can brook to be commanded
Under Cominius.
BRUTUS.
Fame, at the which he aims,--
In whom already he is well grac'd,--cannot
Better be held, nor more attain'd, than by
A place below the first: for what miscarries
Shall be the general's fault, though he perform
To th' utmost of a man; and giddy censure
Will then cry out of Marcius 'O, if he
Had borne the business!'
SICINIUS.
Besides, if things go well,
Opinion, that so sticks on Marcius, shall
Of his demerits rob Cominius.
BRUTUS.
Come:
Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius,
Though Marcius earn'd them not; and all his faults
To Marcius shall be honours, though, indeed,
In aught he merit not.
SICINIUS.
Let's hence and hear
How the dispatch is made; and in what fashion,
More than in singularity, he goes
Upon this present action.
BRUTUS.
Let's along.
[Exeunt.]
SCENE II. Corioli. The Senate House.
[Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS and certain SENATORS.]
FIRST SENATOR.
So, your opinion is, Aufidius,
That they of Rome are enter'd in our counsels
And know how we proceed.
AUFIDIUS.
Is it not yours?
What ever have been thought on in this state,
That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome
Had circumvention! 'Tis not four days gone
Since I heard thence; these are the words: I think
I have the letter here;yes, here it is:
[Reads.]
'They have pressed a power, but it is not known
Whether for east or west: the dearth is great;
The people mutinous: and it is rumour'd,
Cominius, Marcius your old enemy,--
Who is of Rome worse hated than of you,--
And Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman,
These three lead on this preparation
Whither 'tis bent: most likely 'tis for you:
Consider of it.'
