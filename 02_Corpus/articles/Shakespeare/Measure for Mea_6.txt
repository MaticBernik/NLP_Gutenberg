_Ang._ 'Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,
Another thing to fall. I not deny,
The jury, passing on the prisoner's life,
May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two                         20
Guiltier than him they try. What's open made to justice,
That justice seizes: what know the laws
That theives do pass on thieves? 'Tis very pregnant,
The jewel that we find, we stoop and take't,
Because we see it; but what we do not see                           25
We tread upon, and never think of it.
You may not so extenuate his offence
For I have had such faults; but rather tell me,
When I, that censure him, do so offend,
Let mine own judgement pattern out my death,                        30
And nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die.
_Escal._ Be it as your wisdom will.
_Ang._                            Where is the provost?
_Prov._ Here, if it like your honour.
_Ang._                              See that Claudio
Be executed by nine to-morrow morning:
Bring him his confessor, let him be prepared;                       35
For that's the utmost of his pilgrimage.    [_Exit Provost._
_Escal._ [_Aside_] Well, heaven forgive him! and forgive us all!
Some rise by sin, and some by virtue fall:
Some run from brakes of ice, and answer none;
And some condemned for a fault alone.                               40
  _Enter ELBOW, and _Officers_ with FROTH and POMPEY._
_Elb._ Come, bring them away: if these be good people
in a commonweal that do nothing but use their abuses in
common houses, I know no law: bring them away.
_Ang._ How now, sir! What's your name? and what's
the matter?                                                         45
_Elb._ If it please your honour, I am the poor Duke's
constable, and my name is Elbow: I do lean upon justice,
sir, and do bring in here before your good honour two notorious
benefactors.
_Ang._ Benefactors? Well; what benefactors are they?                50
are they not malefactors?
_Elb._ If it please your honour, I know not well what
they are: but precise villains they are, that I am sure of;
and void of all profanation in the world that good Christians
ought to have.                                                      55
_Escal._ This comes off well; here's a wise officer.
_Ang._ Go to: what quality are they of? Elbow is
your name? why dost thou not speak, Elbow?
_Pom._ He cannot, sir; he's out at elbow.
_Ang._ What are you, sir?                                           60
_Elb._ He, sir! a tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; one that
serves a bad woman; whose house, sir, was, as they say,
plucked down in the suburbs; and now she professes a hot-house,
which, I think, is a very ill house too.
_Escal._ How know you that?                                         65
_Elb._ My wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and
your honour,--
_Escal._ How? thy wife?
_Elb._ Ay, sir;--whom, I thank heaven, is an honest
woman,--                                                            70
_Escal._ Dost thou detest her therefore?
_Elb._ I say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well as she,
that this house, if it be not a bawd's house, it is pity of her
life, for it is a naughty house.
