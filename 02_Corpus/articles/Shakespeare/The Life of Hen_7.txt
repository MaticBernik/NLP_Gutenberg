CHAMBERLAIN.
I will, my lord.
[Whispers the Masquers.]
WOLSEY.
What say they?
CHAMBERLAIN.
Such a one, they all confess,
There is indeed; which they would have your Grace
Find out, and he will take it.
WOLSEY.
Let me see, then.
By all your good leaves, gentlemen; here I'll make
My royal choice.
KING.
Ye have found him, Cardinal.  [Unmasking.]
You hold a fair assembly; you do well, lord.
You are a churchman, or, I'll tell you, Cardinal,
I should judge now unhappily.
WOLSEY.
I am glad
Your Grace is grown so pleasant.
KING.
My Lord Chamberlain,
Prithee come hither.  What fair lady's that?
CHAMBERLAIN.
An't please your Grace, Sir Thomas Bullen's daughter,--
The Viscount Rochford,--one of her Highness' women.
KING.
By heaven, she is a dainty one. Sweetheart,
I were unmannerly to take you out
And not to kiss you. A health, gentlemen
Let it go round.
WOLSEY.
Sir Thomas Lovell, is the banquet ready
I' the privy chamber?
LOVELL.
Yes, my lord.
WOLSEY.
Your Grace,
I fear, with dancing is a little heated.
KING.
I fear, too much.
WOLSEY.
There's fresher air, my lord,
In the next chamber.
KING.
Lead in your ladies, every one. Sweet partner,
I must not yet forsake you; let's be merry.
Good my Lord Cardinal, I have half a dozen healths
To drink to these fair ladies, and a measure
To lead 'em once again; and then let's dream
Who's best in favour. Let the music knock it.
[Exeunt with trumpets.]
ACT II.
SCENE 1. Westminster. A street.
[Enter two Gentlemen at several doors.]
FIRST GENTLEMAN.
Whither away so fast?
SECOND GENTLEMAN.
O, God save ye!
Even to the hall, to hear what shall become
Of the great Duke of Buckingham.
FIRST GENTLEMAN.
I'll save you
That labour, sir. All's now done, but the ceremony
Of bringing back the prisoner.
SECOND GENTLEMAN.
Were you there?
FIRST GENTLEMAN.
Yes, indeed, was I.
SECOND GENTLEMAN.
Pray, speak what has happen'd.
FIRST GENTLEMAN.
You may guess quickly what.
SECOND GENTLEMAN.
Is he found guilty?
FIRST GENTLEMAN.
Yes, truly is he, and condemn'd upon't.
SECOND GENTLEMAN.
I am sorry for't.
FIRST GENTLEMAN.
So are a number more.
SECOND GENTLEMAN.
But, pray, how pass'd it?
FIRST GENTLEMAN.
I'll tell you in a little. The great Duke
Came to the bar; where to his accusations
He pleaded still not guilty and alleged
Many sharp reasons to defeat the law.
The King's attorney on the contrary
Urg'd on the examinations, proofs, confessions
Of divers witnesses; which the Duke desir'd
To have brought viva voce to his face;
At which appear'd against him his surveyor;
Sir Gilbert Peck his chancellor; and John Car,
Confessor to him, with that devil-monk,
Hopkins, that made this mischief.
SECOND GENTLEMAN.
That was he
That fed him with his prophecies?
FIRST GENTLEMAN.
The same.
All these accus'd him strongly; which he fain
Would have flung from him, but, indeed, he could not.
And so his peers, upon this evidence,
Have found him guilty of high treason. Much
He spoke, and learnedly, for life; but all
Was either pitied in him or forgotten.
