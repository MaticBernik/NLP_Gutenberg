LOUIS.
May be he will not touch young Arthur's life,
But hold himself safe in his prisonment.
PANDULPH.
O, sir, when he shall hear of your approach,
If that young Arthur be not gone already,
Even at that news he dies; and then the hearts
Of all his people shall revolt from him,
And kiss the lips of unacquainted change;
And pick strong matter of revolt and wrath
Out of the bloody fingers' ends of john.
Methinks I see this hurly all on foot:
And, O, what better matter breeds for you
Than I have nam'd!--The bastard Falconbridge
Is now in England, ransacking the church,
Offending charity: if but a dozen French
Were there in arms, they would be as a call
To train ten thousand English to their side:
Or as a little snow, tumbled about
Anon becomes a mountain. O noble Dauphin,
Go with me to the king:--'tis wonderful
What may be wrought out of their discontent,
Now that their souls are topful of offence:
For England go:--I will whet on the king.
LOUIS.
Strong reasons makes strong actions: let us go:
If you say ay, the king will not say no.
[Exeunt.]
ACT IV.
SCENE 1.  Northampton. A Room in the Castle.
[Enter HUBERT and two Attendants.]
HUBERT.
Heat me these irons hot; and look thou stand
Within the arras: when I strike my foot
Upon the bosom of the ground, rush forth
And bind the boy which you shall find with me
Fast to the chair: be heedful: hence, and watch.
FIRST ATTENDANT.
I hope your warrant will bear out the deed.
HUBERT.
Uncleanly scruples! Fear not you; look to't.--
[Exeunt ATTENDANTS.]
Young lad, come forth; I have to say with you.
[Enter ARTHUR.]
ARTHUR.
Good morrow, Hubert.
HUBERT.
Good morrow, little prince.
ARTHUR.
As little prince, having so great a tide
To be more prince, as may be.--You are sad.
HUBERT.
Indeed I have been merrier.
ARTHUR.
Mercy on me!
Methinks no body should be sad but I:
Yet, I remember, when I was in France,
Young gentlemen would be as sad as night,
Only for wantonness. By my christendom,
So I were out of prison, and kept sheep,
I should be as merry as the day is long;
And so I would be here, but that I doubt
My uncle practises more harm to me:
He is afraid of me, and I of him:
Is it my fault that I was Geffrey's son?
No, indeed, is't not; and I would to heaven
I were your son, so you would love me, Hubert.
HUBERT.
[Aside.] If I talk to him, with his innocent prate
He will awake my mercy, which lies dead:
Therefore I will be sudden and despatch.
ARTHUR.
Are you sick, Hubert? you look pale to-day:
In sooth, I would you were a little sick,
That I might sit all night and watch with you:
I warrant I love you more than you do me.
HUBERT.
[Aside.] His words do take possession of my bosom.--
Read here, young Arthur.
