  _Gregory._ No, for then we should be colliers.
  _Sampson._ I mean, an we be in choler we'll draw.
  _Gregory._ Ay, while you live, draw your neck out
  o' the collar.
  _Sampson._ I strike quickly, being moved.
  _Gregory._ But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
  _Sampson._ A dog of the house of Montague moves
  me.                                                               10
  _Gregory._ To move is to stir, and to be valiant is
  to stand; therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st
  away.
  _Sampson._ A dog of that house shall move me to
  stand; I will take the wall of any man or maid of
  Montague's.
  _Gregory._ That shows thee a weak slave; for the
  weakest goes to the wall.
  _Sampson._ True; and therefore women, being the
  weaker vessels, are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore            20
  I will push Montague's men from the wall, and
  thrust his maids to the wall.
  _Gregory._ The quarrel is between our masters and
  us their men.
  _Sampson._ 'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant;
  when I have fought with the men, I will be cruel
  with the maids and cut off their heads.
  _Gregory._ Draw thy tool; here comes two of the
  house of the Montagues.
  _Sampson._ My naked weapon is out; quarrel, I                     30
  will back thee.
  _Gregory._ How? turn thy back and run?
  _Sampson._ Fear me not.
  _Gregory._ No, marry; I fear thee!
  _Sampson._ Let us take the law of our sides; let
  them begin.
  _Gregory._ I will frown as I pass by, and let them
  take it as they list.
  _Sampson._ Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb
  at them, which is a disgrace to them if they bear it.             40
_Enter_ ABRAM _and_ BALTHASAR
  _Abram._ Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
  _Sampson._ I do bite my thumb, sir.
  _Abram._ Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
  _Sampson._ [_Aside to Gregory_] Is the law of our
  side, if I say ay?
  _Gregory._ No.
  _Sampson._ No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you,
  sir, but I bite my thumb, sir.
  _Gregory._ Do you quarrel, sir?
  _Abram._ Quarrel, sir! no, sir.                                   50
  _Sampson._ If you do, sir, I am for you; I serve as
  good a man as you.
  _Abram._ No better.
  _Sampson._ Well, sir.
  _Gregory._ [_Aside to Sampson_] Say 'better'; here
  comes one of my master's kinsmen.
  _Sampson._ Yes, better, sir.
  _Abram._ You lie.
  _Sampson._ Draw, if you be men.--Gregory, remember
  thy swashing blow.                               [_They fight._   60
_Enter_ BENVOLIO
  _Benvolio._ Part, fools!
  Put up your swords; you know not what you do.
                                        [_Beats down their swords._
_Enter_ TYBALT
  _Tybalt._ What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
  Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.
  _Benvolio._ I do but keep the peace; put up thy sword,
  Or manage it to part these men with me.
  _Tybalt._ What, drawn and talk of peace! I hate the word,
  As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee;
  Have at thee, coward!
                                                     [_They fight._
_Enter several of both houses who join the fray; then enter_ Citizens,
_with clubs_
