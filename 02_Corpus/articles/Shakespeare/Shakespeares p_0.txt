Museum, by Josse Amman, who died in 1591.]
[Footnote 2: _--argosies_; A name given, in our author's time, to ships
of great burthen. The name is supposed by some to be derived from the
classical ship, Argo, as a vessel eminently famous.]
[Footnote 3: _Plucking the_; By holding up the grass, or any light body
that will bend by a gentle blast, the direction of the wind is found.]
[Footnote 4: _--my wealthy Andrew_; The name of the ship.]
[Footnote 5: Vailing _her high-top_; To _vail_ is "_to lower_," or "_let
fall_."]
[Footnote 6: _Let me play the fool_; Alluding to the common comparison
of human life to a stage-play. So that he desires his may be the fool's
or buffoon's part, which was a constant character in the old farces;
from whence came the phrase, _to play the fool_.--WARBURTON.]
[Footnote 7: _--whose visages do_ cream; The poet here alludes to the
manner in which the film extends itself over milk in scalding; and he
had the same appearance in his eye when writing a foregoing line: "_With
mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come_."--HENLEY.]
[Footnote 8: _--a wilful stillness entertain,; Id est_, an obstinate
silence.]
[Footnote 9: _let no dog bark_!; This seems to be a proverbial
expression.]
[Footnote 10: _--'twould almost damn those ears_; The author's meaning
is this:--That some people are thought wise whilst they keep silence;
who, when they open their mouths, are such stupid praters, that the
hearers cannot help calling them _fools_, and so incur the judgment
denounced in the Gospel.--THEOBALD.]
[Footnote 11: _I'll end my exhortation after dinner_.'; The humour of
this consists in its being an allusion to the practice of the Puritan
preachers of those times, who being generally very long and tedious,
were often forced to put off that part of their sermon called the
_exhortation_, till after dinner.--WARBURTON.]
[Footnote 12: _--for this gear_.; A colloquial expression, meaning _for
this matter_.]

SCENE II.--BELMONT. A ROOM IN PORTIA'S HOUSE.
_Enter_ PORTIA _and_ NERISSA.
_Por_. By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is a-weary of this great
world.
_Ner_. You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in the same
abundance as your good fortunes are. And yet, for aught I see, they are
as sick that surfeit with too much, as they that starve with nothing. It
is no small happiness, therefore, to be seated in the mean; superfluity
comes sooner by white hairs,[17] but competency lives longer.
_Por_. Good sentences, and well pronounced.
_Ner_. They would be better, if well followed.
_Por_. If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels
had been churches, and poor men's cottages princes' palaces. It is a
good divine that follows his own instructions: I can easier teach twenty
what were good to be done, than be one of the twenty to follow mine own
teaching. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a
husband:--O me, the word choose! I may neither choose whom I would, nor
refuse whom I dislike, so is the will of a living daughter curb'd by the
will of a dead father:--Is it not hard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose
one, nor refuse none?
