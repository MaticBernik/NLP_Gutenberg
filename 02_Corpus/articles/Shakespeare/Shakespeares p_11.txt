[_Exit_ LAUNCELOT.
_Bas_. I pray thee, good Leonardo, think on this; 
These things being bought and orderly bestow'd, 
Return in haste, for I do feast to-night 
My best-esteem'd acquaintance: hie thee, go.
_Leo_. My best endeavours shall be done herein.
_Enter_ GRATIANO.
_Gra_. Where is your master?
_Leo_. Yonder, sir, he walks.
[_Exit_ LEONARDO
_Gra_. Signior Bassanio,--
_Bas_. Gratiano!
_Gra_. I have a suit to you.
_Bas_. You have obtained it.
_Gra_. You must not deny me: I must go with you to Belmont.
_Bas_. Why, then you must.--But hear thee, Gratiano;
Thou art too wild, too rude, and bold of voice;
Parts, that become thee happily enough,
And in such eyes as ours appear not faults;
But, where they are not known, why, there they show
Something too liberal:[57]--pray thee take pain
To allay with some cold drops of modesty
Thy skipping spirit; lest, through thy wild behaviour,
I be misconstrued in the place I go to,
And lose my hopes.
_Gra_. Signior Bassanio, hear me:
If I do not put on a sober habit,
Talk with respect, and swear but now and then,
Wear prayer-books in my pocket, look demurely;
Nay more, while grace is saying, hood mine eyes[58]
Thus with my hat, and sigh, and say amen;
Use all the observance of civility,
Like one well studied in a sad ostent;[59]
To please his grandam,--never trust me more.
_Bas_, Well, we shall see your bearing.[60]
_Gra_. Nay, but I bar to-night; you shall not gage me
By what we do to-night.
_Bas_. No, that were pity;
I would entreat you rather to put on
Your boldest suit of mirth, for we have friends
That purpose merriment: But fare you well,
I have some business.
_Gra_. And I must to Lorenzo and the rest;
But we will visit you at supper time.
[_Exeunt_.
_Enter_ JESSICA _and_ LAUNCELOT _from_ SHYLOCK'S _house_.
_Jes_. I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so;
Our house is hell, and thou, a merry devil,
Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness:
But fare thee well: there is a ducat for thee;
And, Launcelot, soon at supper shall thou see
Lorenzo, who is thy new master's guest:
Give him this letter; do it secretly,
And so farewell; I would not have my father
See me in talk with thee.
_Lau_. Adieu!--Tears exhibit my tongue. Most beautiful
pagan,--most sweet Jew! Adieu! these foolish drops do
somewhat drown my manly spirit: adieu.
[_Exit_.
_Jes_. Farewell, good Launcelot.
Alack, what heinous sin is it in me,
To be asham'd to be my father's child!
But though I am a daughter to his blood,
I am not to his manners: O Lorenzo,
If thou keep promise, I shall end this strife;
Become a Christian, and thy loving wife.
[_Exit into house_.
_Enter_ GRATIANO, LORENZO, SALARINO, _and_ SALANIO.
_Lor_. Nay, we will slink away in supper time;
Disguise us at my lodging, and return
All in an hour.
_Gra_. We have not made good preparation.
_Salar_. We have not spoke us yet of torch-bearers.[61]
