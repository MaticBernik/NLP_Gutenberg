SECOND GENTLEMAN.
If the Duke be guiltless,
'Tis full of woe; yet I can give you inkling
Of an ensuing evil, if it fall,
Greater than this.
FIRST GENTLEMAN.
Good angels keep it from us!
What may it be? You do not doubt my faith, sir?
SECOND GENTLEMAN.
This secret is so weighty, 'twill require
A strong faith to conceal it.
FIRST GENTLEMAN.
Let me have it.
I do not talk much.
SECOND GENTLEMAN.
I am confident;
You shall, sir. Did you not of late days hear
A buzzing of a separation
Between the King and Katherine?
FIRST GENTLEMAN.
Yes, but it held not;
For when the King once heard it, out of anger
He sent command to the Lord Mayor straight
To stop the rumour, and allay those tongues
That durst disperse it.
SECOND GENTLEMAN.
But that slander, sir,
Is found a truth now; for it grows again
Fresher than e'er it was; and held for certain
The King will venture at it. Either the Cardinal,
Or some about him near, have, out of malice
To the good Queen, possess'd him with a scruple
That will undo her. To confirm this too,
Cardinal Campeius is arriv'd, and lately;
As all think, for this business.
FIRST GENTLEMAN.
'Tis the Cardinal;
And merely to revenge him on the Emperor
For not bestowing on him, at his asking,
The archbishopric of Toledo, this is purpos'd.
SECOND GENTLEMAN.
I think you have hit the mark; but is't not cruel
That she should feel the smart of this? The Cardinal
Will have his will, and she must fall.
FIRST GENTLEMAN.
'Tis woeful.
We are too open here to argue this;
Let's think in private more.
[Exeunt.]
SCENE II.  An ante-chamber in the palace.
[Enter the Lord Chamberlain, reading this letter:.]
CHAMBERLAIN.
"My lord, the horses your lordship sent for,
with all the care had, I saw well chosen, ridden, and furnish'd.
They were young and handsome, and of the best breed in the north.
When they were ready to set out for London, a man of
my Lord Cardinal's, by commission and main power, took
'em from me, with this reason: His master would be serv'd
before a subject, if not before the King; which stopp'd
our mouths, sir." I fear he will indeed. Well, let him have them:
He will have all, I think.
[Enter to the Lord Chamberlain the Dukes of Norfolk and
Suffolk.]
NORFOLK.
Well met, my Lord Chamberlain.
CHAMBERLAIN.
Good day to both your Graces.
SUFFOLK.
How is the King employ'd?
CHAMBERLAIN.
I left him private,
Full of sad thoughts and troubles.
NORFOLK.
What's the cause?
CHAMBERLAIN.
It seems the marriage with his brother's wife
Has crept too near his conscience.
SUFFOLK.
No, his conscience
Has crept too near another lady.
NORFOLK.
'Tis so.
This is the Cardinal's doing, the king-cardinal.
That blind priest, like the eldest son of Fortune,
Turns what he list. The King will know him one day.
SUFFOLK.
Pray God he do! he'll never know himself else.
