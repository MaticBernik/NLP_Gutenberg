KING.
Poor soul, God's goodness hath been great to thee;
Let never day nor night unhallow'd pass,
But still remember what the Lord hath done.
QUEEN.
Tell me, good fellow, cam'st thou here by chance,
Or of devotion, to this holy shrine?
SIMPCOX.
God knows, of pure devotion; being call'd
A hundred times and oftener, in my sleep,
By good Saint Alban, who said 'Simpcox, come,
Come, offer at my shrine, and I will help thee.'
WIFE.
Most true, forsooth; and many time and oft
Myself have heard a voice to call him so.
CARDINAL.
What, art thou lame?
SIMPCOX.
Ay, God Almighty help me!
SUFFOLK.
How cam'st thou so?
SIMPCOX.
A fall off of a tree.
WIFE.
A plum-tree, master.
GLOSTER.
How long hast thou been blind?
SIMPCOX.
O, born so, master!
GLOSTER.
What, and wouldst climb a tree?
SIMPCOX.
But that in all my life, when I was a youth.
WIFE.
Too true; and bought his climbing very dear.
GLOSTER.
Mass, thou lov'dst plums well that wouldst venture so.
SIMPCOX.
Alas, good master, my wife desir'd some damsons,
And made me climb, with danger of my life.
GLOSTER.
A subtle knave! but yet it shall not serve.--
Let me see thine eyes.--Wink now;--now open them.
In my opinion yet thou seest not well.
SIMPCOX.
Yes, master, clear as day, I thank God and Saint Alban.
GLOSTER.
Say'st thou me so? What colour is this cloak of?
SIMPCOX.
Red, master, red as blood.
GLOSTER.
Why, that's well said. What colour is my gown of?
SIMPCOX.
Black, forsooth, coal-black as jet.
KING.
Why, then, thou know'st what colour jet is of?
SUFFOLK.
And yet, I think, jet did he never see.
GLOSTER.
But cloaks and gowns before this day, a many.
WIFE.
Never before this day in all his life.
GLOSTER.
Tell me, sirrah, what's my name?
SIMPCOX.
Alas, master, I know not.
GLOSTER.
What's his name?
SIMPCOX.
I know not.
GLOSTER.
Nor his?
SIMPCOX.
No, indeed, master.
GLOSTER.
What's thine own name?
SIMPCOX.
Saunder Simpcox, an if it please you, master.
GLOSTER.
Then, Saunder, sit there, the lyingest knave in
Christendom. If thou hadst been born blind, thou mightst as well
have known all our names as thus to name the several colours we
do wear. Sight may distinguish of colours; but suddenly to
nominate them all, it is impossible.--My lords, Saint Alban here
hath done a miracle; and would ye not think his cunning to be
great that could restore this cripple to his legs again?
SIMPCOX.
O master, that you could!
GLOSTER.
My masters of Saint Alban's, have you not beadles in
your town, and things called whips?
MAYOR.
Yes, my lord, if it please your grace.
GLOSTER.
Then send for one presently.
MAYOR.
Sirrah, go fetch the beadle hither straight.
[Exit an Attendant.]
GLOSTER.
Now fetch me a stool hither by and by.--Now, sirrah,
if you mean to save yourself from whipping, leap me over this
stool and run away.
SIMPCOX.
Alas, master, I am not able to stand alone;
You go about to torture me in vain.
