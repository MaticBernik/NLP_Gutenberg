  _K. Hen._ We are no tyrant, but a Christian king;
  Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness
  Tell us the Dauphin's mind.
  _Amb._                    Thus, then, in few.[15]
  Your highness, lately sending into France,
  Did claim some certain dukedoms, in the right
  Of your great predecessor, King Edward the Third.
  In answer of which claim, the prince our master
  Says,--that you savour too much of your youth;
  And bids you be advis'd, there's nought in France
  That can be with a nimble galliard won;[16]
  You cannot revel into dukedoms there.
  He therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit,
  This tun of treasure; and, in lieu of this,
  Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim
  Hear no more of you. This the Dauphin speaks.
  _K. Hen._ What treasure, uncle?
  _Exe._ (_Opening the chest._)
                                Tennis-balls, my liege.(H)
  _K. Hen._ We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us;
  His present and your pains we thank you for:
  When we have match'd our rackets to these balls,
  We will, in France, by Heaven's grace, play a set
  Shall strike his father's crown into the hazard.
  And we understand him well,
  How he comes o'er us with our wilder days,
  Not measuring what use we made of them.
  But tell the Dauphin,--I will keep my state;
  Be like a king, and show my soul of greatness,
  When I do rouse me in my throne of France:
  For I will rise there with so full a glory,
  That I will dazzle all the eyes of France,
  Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us.
  But this lies all within the will of Heaven,
  To whom I do appeal; And in whose name,
  Tell you the Dauphin, I am coming on,
  To venge me as I may, and to put forth
  My rightful hand in a well-hallow'd cause.
  So, get you hence in peace; and tell the Dauphin,
  His jest will savour but of shallow wit,
  When thousands weep, more than did laugh at it.--
  Convey them with safe conduct.--Fare you well.
    [_Exeunt AMBASSADOR, and Attendants, L.H._
  _Exe._ This was a merry message.
  _K. Hen._ We hope to make the sender blush at it.
    [_The KING rises._
  Therefore, my lords, omit no happy hour
  That may give furtherance to our expedition;
  For we have now no thought in us but France,
  Save those to Heaven, that run before our business.
  Therefore let our proportions for these wars
  Be soon collected, and all things thought upon
  That may with reasonable swiftness add
  More feathers to our wings; for, Heaven before,
  We'll chide this Dauphin at his father's door.
