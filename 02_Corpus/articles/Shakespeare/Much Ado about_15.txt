URSULA.
She's lim'd, I warrant you: we have caught her, madam.
HERO.
If it prove so, then loving goes by haps:
Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.
[Exeunt HERO and URSULA.]
BEATRICE.
[Advancing.] What fire is in mine ears? Can this be true?
  Stand I condemn'd for pride and scorn so much?
Contempt, farewell! and maiden pride, adieu!
  No glory lives behind the back of such.
And, Benedick, love on; I will requite thee,
  Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand:
If thou dost love, my kindness shall incite thee
  To bind our loves up in a holy band;
For others say thou dost deserve, and I
Believe it better than reportingly.
[Exit.]
Scene 2. A Room in LEONATO'S House.
[Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, and LEONATO.]
DON PEDRO.
I do but stay till your marriage be consummate, and then go I
toward Arragon.
CLAUDIO.
I'll bring you thither, my lord, if you'll vouchsafe me.
DON PEDRO.
Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your marriage,
as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it. I will only
be bold with Benedick for his company; for, from the crown of his head
to the sole of his foot, he is all mirth; he hath twice or thrice cut
Cupid's bowstring, and the little hangman dare not shoot at him. He
hath a heart as sound as a bell, and his tongue is the clapper; for
what his heart thinks his tongue speaks.
BENEDICK.
Gallants, I am not as I have been.
LEONATO.
So say I: methinks you are sadder.
CLAUDIO.
I hope he be in love.
DON PEDRO.
Hang him, truant! there's no true drop of blood in him, to be truly
touched with love. If he be sad, he wants money.
BENEDICK.
I have the tooth-ache.
DON PEDRO.
Draw it.
BENEDICK.
Hang it.
CLAUDIO.
You must hang it first, and draw it afterwards.
DON PEDRO.
What! sigh for the tooth-ache?
LEONATO.
Where is but a humour or a worm?
BENEDICK.
Well, every one can master a grief but he that has it.
CLAUDIO.
Yet say I, he is in love.
DON PEDRO.
There is no appearance of fancy in him, unless it be a fancy that he
hath to strange disguises; as to be a Dutchman to-day, a Frenchman
to-morrow; or in the shape of two countries at once, as a German from
the waist downward, all slops, and a Spaniard from the hip upward, no
doublet. Unless he have a fancy to this foolery, as it appears he hath,
he is no fool for fancy, as you would have it appear he is.
CLAUDIO.
If he be not in love with some woman, there is no believing old signs:
a' brushes his hat a mornings; what should that bode?
DON PEDRO.
Hath any man seen him at the barber's?
CLAUDIO.
No, but the barber's man hath been seen with him; and the old
ornament of his cheek hath already stuffed tennis-balls.
