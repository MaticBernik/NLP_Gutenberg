[Footnote 6: Qualify.]
[Footnote 7: _1st Q_. 'an attentiue eare,'.]
[Footnote 8: Possibly, _dead vast_, as in _1st Q_.; but _waste_ as good,
leaving also room to suppose a play in the word.]
[Footnote 9: Note the careful uncertainty.]
[Footnote 10: _1st Q. 'Capapea_.']
[Footnote 11: Either word would do: the _distilling_ off of the animal
spirits would leave the man a jelly; the cold of fear would _bestil_
them and him to a jelly. _1st Q. distilled_. But I judge _bestil'd_ the
better, as the truer to the operation of fear. Compare _The Winter's
Tale_, act v. sc. 3:--
    There's magic in thy majesty, which has
    From thy admiring daughter took the spirits,
    Standing like stone with thee.]
[Footnote 12: Act: present influence.]
[Footnote 13: a secrecy more than solemn.]

[Page 30]
Forme of the thing; each word made true and good,
The Apparition comes. I knew your Father:
These hands are not more like.
_Ham_. But where was this?
_Mar_. My Lord, vpon the platforme where we watcht.    [Sidenote: watch]
_Ham_. Did you not speake to it?
_Her_. My Lord, I did;
But answere made it none: yet once me thought
It lifted vp it head, and did addresse
It selfe to motion, like as it would speake:
But euen then, the Morning Cocke crew lowd;
And at the sound it shrunke in hast away,
And vanisht from our sight.
_Ham_. Tis very strange.
_Hor_. As I doe liue my honourd Lord 'tis true;
[Sidenote: 14] And we did thinke it writ downe in our duty
To let you know of it.
[Sidenote: 32,52] _Ham_. Indeed, indeed Sirs; but this troubles me.
                                            [Sidenote: Indeede Sirs but]
Hold you the watch to Night?
_Both_. We doe my Lord.                               [Sidenote: _All_.]
_Ham_. Arm'd, say you?
_Both_. Arm'd, my Lord.                               [Sidenote: _All_.]
_Ham_. From top to toe?
_Both_. My Lord, from head to foote.                  [Sidenote: _All_.]
_Ham_. Then saw you not his face?
_Hor_. O yes, my Lord, he wore his Beauer vp.
_Ham_. What, lookt he frowningly?
[Sidenote: 54,174] _Hor_. A countenance more in sorrow then in anger.[1]
[Sidenote: 120] _Ham_. Pale, or red?
_Hor_. Nay very pale.
[Footnote 1: The mood of the Ghost thus represented, remains the same
towards his wife throughout the play.]
[Page 32]
_Ham._ And fixt his eyes vpon you?
_Hor._ Most constantly.
_Ham._ I would I had beene there.
_Hor._ It would haue much amaz'd you.
_Ham._ Very like, very like: staid it long? [Sidenote: Very like, stayd]
_Hor._ While one with moderate hast might tell a hundred.
                                                    [Sidenote: hundreth]
_All._ Longer, longer.                               [Sidenote: _Both._]
_Hor._ Not when I saw't.
_Ham._ His Beard was grisly?[1] no.                 [Sidenote: grissl'd]
_Hor._ It was, as I haue seene it in his life,
[Sidenote: 138] A Sable[2] Siluer'd.
_Ham._ Ile watch to Night; perchance 'twill wake againe.
                                               [Sidenote: walke againe.]
_Hor._ I warrant you it will.                     [Sidenote:  warn't it]
[Sidenote: 44] _Ham._ If it assume my noble Fathers person,[3]
Ile speake to it, though Hell it selfe should gape
And bid me hold my peace.  I pray you all,
If you haue hitherto conceald this sight;
Let it bee treble[5] in your silence still: [Sidenote: be tenable in[4]]
And whatsoeuer els shall hap to night,      [Sidenote: what someuer els]
Giue it an vnderstanding but no tongue;
I will requite your loues; so, fare ye well:       [Sidenote: farre you]
Vpon the Platforme twixt eleuen and twelue,
                                         [Sidenote: a leauen and twelfe]
Ile visit you.
