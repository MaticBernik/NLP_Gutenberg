SEB. Ha, ha, ha!
ANT. So, you're paid.
ADR. Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible,--
SEB. Yet,--
ADR. Yet,--
ANT. He could not miss't.
ADR. It must needs be of subtle, tender and delicate temperance.
ANT. Temperance was a delicate wench.
SEB. Ay, and a subtle: as he most learnedly delivered.
ADR. The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.
SEB. As if it had lungs and rotten ones.
ANT. Or as 'twere perfumed by a fen.
GON. Here is every thing advantageous to life.
ANT. True: save means to live.
SEB. Of that there's none, or little.
GON. How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!
ANT. The ground indeed is tawny.
SEB. With an eye of green in't.
ANT. He misses not much.
SEB. No; he doth but mistake the truth totally.
GON. But the rarity of it is,--which is indeed almost beyond credit,--
SEB. As many vouched rarities are.
GON. That our garments, being, as they were, drenched in the sea, hold
notwithstanding their freshness and glosses, being rather new-dyed than
stained with salt water.
ANT. If but one of his pockets could speak, would it not say he lies?
SEB. Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report.
GON. Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we put them on
first in Afric, at the marriage of the king's fair daughter Claribel to
the King of Tunis.
SEB. 'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return.
ADR. Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to their queen.
GON. Not since widow Dido's time.
ANT. Widow! a plague o' that! How came that widow in? widow Dido!
SEB. What if he had said 'widower Aeneas' too? Good Lord, how you take
it!
ADR. 'Widow Dido' said you? you make me study of that: she was of
Carthage, not of Tunis.
GON. This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.
ADR. Carthage?
GON. I assure you, Carthage.
ANT. His word is more than the miraculous harp.
SEB. He hath raised the wall and houses too.
ANT. What impossible matter will he make easy next?
SEB. I think he will carry this island home in his pocket and give it
his son for an apple.
ANT. And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring forth more islands.
GON. Ay.
ANT. Why, in good time.
GON. Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now as fresh as when
we were at Tunis at the marriage of your daughter, who is now queen.
ANT. And the rarest that e'er came there.
SEB. Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.
ANT. O, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido.
GON. Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I wore it? I
mean, in a sort.
ANT. That sort was well fished for.
GON. When I wore it at your daughter's marriage?
    ALON. You cram these words into mine ears against
    The stomach of my sense. Would I had never
    Married my daughter there! for, coming thence,
    My son is lost and, in my rate, she too,
    Who is so far from Italy removed
    I ne'er again shall see her. O thou mine heir
    Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish
    Hath made his meal on thee?
