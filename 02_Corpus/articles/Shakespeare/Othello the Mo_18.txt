IAGO.
I'll send her to you presently;
And I'll devise a mean to draw the Moor
Out of the way, that your converse and business
May be more free.
CASSIO.
I humbly thank you for't. [Exit Iago.] I never knew
A Florentine more kind and honest.
[Enter Emilia.]
EMILIA.
Good-morrow, good lieutenant; I am sorry
For your displeasure; but all will sure be well.
The general and his wife are talking of it;
And she speaks for you stoutly: the Moor replies
That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus
And great affinity, and that, in wholesome wisdom,
He might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you
And needs no other suitor but his likings
To take the safest occasion by the front
To bring you in again.
CASSIO.
Yet, I beseech you,--
If you think fit, or that it may be done,--
Give me advantage of some brief discourse
With Desdemona alone.
EMILIA.
Pray you, come in:
I will bestow you where you shall have time
To speak your bosom freely.
CASSIO.
I am much bound to you.
[Exeunt.]
SCENE II. Cyprus. A Room in the Castle.
[Enter Othello, Iago, and Gentlemen.]
OTHELLO.
These letters give, Iago, to the pilot;
And by him do my duties to the senate:
That done, I will be walking on the works;
Repair there to me.
IAGO.
Well, my good lord, I'll do't.
OTHELLO.
This fortification, gentlemen,--shall we see't?
GENTLEMEN.
We'll wait upon your lordship.
[Exeunt.]
SCENE III. Cyprus. The Garden of the Castle.
[Enter Desdemona, Cassio, and Emilia.]
DESDEMONA.
Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will do
All my abilities in thy behalf.
EMILIA.
Good madam, do: I warrant it grieves my husband
As if the cause were his.
DESDEMONA.
O, that's an honest fellow.--Do not doubt, Cassio,
But I will have my lord and you again
As friendly as you were.
CASSIO.
Bounteous madam,
Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio,
He's never anything but your true servant.
DESDEMONA.
I know't,--I thank you. You do love my lord:
You have known him long; and be you well assur'd
He shall in strangeness stand no farther off
Than in a politic distance.
CASSIO.
Ay, but, lady,
That policy may either last so long,
Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet,
Or breed itself so out of circumstance,
That, I being absent, and my place supplied,
My general will forget my love and service.
DESDEMONA.
Do not doubt that; before Emilia here
I give thee warrant of thy place: assure thee,
If I do vow a friendship, I'll perform it
To the last article: my lord shall never rest;
I'll watch him tame, and talk him out of patience;
His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;
I'll intermingle everything he does
With Cassio's suit: therefore be merry, Cassio;
For thy solicitor shall rather die
Than give thy cause away.
EMILIA.
Madam, here comes my lord.
CASSIO.
Madam, I'll take my leave.
DESDEMONA.
Why, stay, and hear me speak.
