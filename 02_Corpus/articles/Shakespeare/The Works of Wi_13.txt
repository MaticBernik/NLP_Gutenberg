    _Pet._ Peace, sirrah!
    _Hor._ Grumio, mum! God save you, Signior Gremio.
    _Gre._ And you are well met, Signior Hortensio.
    Trow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola.
    I promised to inquire carefully                                  160
    About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca:
    And by good fortune I have lighted well
    On this young man, for learning and behaviour
    Fit for her turn, well read in poetry
    And other books, good ones, I warrant ye.                        165
    _Hor._ 'Tis well; and I have met a gentleman
    Hath promised me to help me to another,
    A fine musician to instruct our mistress;
    So shall I no whit be behind in duty
    To fair Bianca, so beloved of me.                                170
    _Gre._ Beloved of me; and that my deeds shall prove.
    _Gru._ And that his bags shall prove.
    _Hor._ Gremio, 'tis now no time to vent our love:
    Listen to me, and if you speak me fair,
    I'll tell you news indifferent good for either.                  175
    Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met,
    Upon agreement from us to his liking,
    Will undertake to woo curst Katharine,
    Yea, and to marry her, if her dowry please.
    _Gre._ So said, so done, is well.                                180
    Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?
    _Pet._ I know she is an irksome brawling scold:
    If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.
    _Gre._ No, say'st me so, friend? What countryman?
    _Pet._ Born in Verona, old Antonio's son:                        185
    My father dead, my fortune lives for me;
    And I do hope good days and long to see.
    _Gre._ O sir, such a life, with such a wife, were strange!
    But if you have a stomach, to't i' God's name:
    You shall have me assisting you in all.                          190
    But will you woo this wild-cat?
    _Pet._                          Will I live?
    _Gru._ Will he woo her? ay, or I'll hang her.
    _Pet._ Why came I hither but to that intent?
    Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?
    Have I not in my time heard lions roar?                          195
    Have I not heard the sea puff'd up with winds
    Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?
    Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,
    And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies?
    Have I not in a pitched battle heard                             200
    Loud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets' clang?
    And do you tell me of a woman's tongue,
    That gives not half so great a blow to hear
    As will a chestnut in a farmer's fire?
    Tush, tush! fear boys with bugs.
    _Gru._                           For he fears none.              205
    _Gre._ Hortensio, hark:
    This gentleman is happily arrived,
    My mind presumes, for his own good and ours.
    _Hor._ I promised we would be contributors
    And bear his charge of wooing, whatsoe'er.                       210
    _Gre._ And so we will, provided that he win her.
    _Gru._ I would I were as sure of a good dinner.
_Enter_ TRANIO _brave_, _and_ BIONDELLO.
    _Tra._ Gentlemen, God save you. If I may be bold,
    Tell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest way
    To the house of Signior Baptista Minola?                         215
