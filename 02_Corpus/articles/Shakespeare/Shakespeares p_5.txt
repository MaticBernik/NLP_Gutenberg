_Shy_. O father Abraham, what these Christians are.
Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect
The thoughts of others! Pray you, tell me this
If he should break his day, what should I gain
By the exaction of the forfeiture?
A pound of man's flesh, taken from a man,
Is not so estimable, profitable neither,
As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats. I say,
To buy his favour I extend this friendship;
If he will take it, so; if not, adieu;
And, for my love, I pray you wrong me not.
_Ant_. Yes, Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.
_Shy_. Then meet me forthwith at the notary's;
Give him direction for this merry bond,
And I will go and purse the ducats straight;
See to my house, left in the fearful guard[38]
Of an unthrifty knave; and presently
I will be with you.
[_Exit_.
_Ant_. Hie thee, gentle Jew.
This Hebrew will turn Christian; he grows kind.
_Bas_. I like not fair terms[39] and a villain's mind.
_Ant_. Come, on; in this there can be no dismay,
My ships come home a month before the day.
[_Exeunt_.

SCENE IV.--SALOON OF THE CASKETS IN PORTIA'S HOUSE, AT BELMONT.
_Flourish of Cornets. Enter the_ PRINCE OF MOROCCO, _and his Train_;
PORTIA, NERISSA, _and other of her Attendants_.
_Mor_. Mislike me not for my complexion,
The shadow'd livery of the burning sun,
To whom I am a neighbour, and near bred.
Bring me the fairest creature northward born,
Where Phoebus' fire scarce thaws the icicles,
And let us make incision for your love,
To prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine.[40]
By love, I swear, I would not change this hue,
Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
I'll try my fortune;
E'en though I may (blind fortune leading me)
Miss that which one unworthier may attain,
And die with grieving.
