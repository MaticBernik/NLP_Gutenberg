BURGUNDY.
My vows are equal partners with thy vows.
TALBOT.
But, ere we go, regard this dying prince,
The valiant Duke of Bedford. Come, my lord,
We will bestow you in some better place,
Fitter for sickness and for crazy age.
BEDFORD.
Lord Talbot, do not so dishonor me:
Here will I sit before the walls of Rouen,
And will be partner of your weal or woe.
BURGUNDY.
Courageous Bedford, let us now persuade you.
BEDFORD.
Not to be gone from hence; for once I read
That stout Pendragon in his litter sick
Came to the field and vanquished his foes.
Methinks I should revive the soldiers' hearts,
Because I ever found them as myself.
TALBOT.
Undaunted spirit in a dying breast!
Then be it so:  heavens keep old Bedford safe!
And now no more ado, brave Burgundy,
But gather we our forces out of hand
And set upon our boasting enemy.
[Exeunt all but Bedford and Attendants.]
[An alarum:  excursions. Enter Sir John Fastolfe
and a Captain.]
CAPTAIN.
Whither away, Sir John Fastolfe, in such haste?
FASTOLFE.
Whither away! to save myself by flight:
We are like to have the overthrow again.
CAPTAIN.
What! Will you fly, and leave Lord Talbot?
FASTOLFE.
Aye,
All the Talbots in the world, to save my life.
[Exit.]
CAPTAIN.
Cowardly knight! ill fortune follow thee!
[Exit.]
[Retreat:  excursions. La Pucelle, Alencon, and Charles fly.]
BEDFORD.
Now, quiet soul, depart when heaven please,
For I have seen our enemies' overthrow.
What is the trust or strength of foolish man?
They that of late were daring with their scoffs
Are glad and fain by flight to save themselves.
[Bedford dies, and is carried in by two in his chair.]
[An alarum. Re-enter Talbot, Burgundy, and the rest.]
TALBOT.
Lost, and recover'd in a day again!
This is a double honor, Burgundy:
Yet heavens have glory for this victory!
BURGUNDY.
Warlike and martial Talbot, Burgundy
Enshrines thee in his heart, and there erects
Thy noble deeds as valor's monuments.
TALBOT.
Thanks, gentle duke. But where is Pucelle now?
I think her old familiar is asleep:
Now where 's the Bastard's braves, and Charles his gleeks?
What, all amort? Rouen hangs her head for grief
That such a valiant company are fled.
Now will we take some order in the town,
Placing therein some expert officers;
And then depart to Paris to the king,
For there young Henry with his nobles lie.
BURGUNDY.
What Lord Talbot pleaseth Burgundy.
TALBOT.
But yet, before we go, let 's not forget
The noble Duke of Bedford late deceased,
But see his exequies fulfill'd in Rouen:
A braver soldier never couched lance,
A gentler heart did never sway in court;
But kings and mightiest potentates must die,
For that's the end of human misery.
[Exeunt.]
SCENE III. The plains near Rouen.
[Enter Charles, the Bastard of Orleans, Alencon, La Pucelle,
and forces.]
PUCELLE.
Dismay not, princes, at this accident,
Nor grieve that Rouen is so recovered:
Care is no cure, but rather corrosive,
For things that are not to be remedied.
Let frantic Talbot triumph for a while
And like a peacock sweep along his tail;
We 'll pull his plumes and take away his train,
If Dauphin and the rest will be but ruled.
