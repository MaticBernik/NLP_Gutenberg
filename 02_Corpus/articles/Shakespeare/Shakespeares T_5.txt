  _Benvolio._ My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
  _Montague._ I neither know it nor can learn of him.
  _Benvolio._ Have you importun'd him by any means?
  _Montague._ Both by myself and many other friends;
  But he, his own affections' counsellor,
  Is to himself--I will not say how true--
  But to himself so secret and so close,
  So far from sounding and discovery,
  As is the bud bit with an envious worm
  Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air
  Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.                               150
  Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
  We would as willingly give cure as know.
_Enter_ ROMEO
  _Benvolio._ See, where he comes! So please you, step aside;
  I'll know his grievance or be much denied.
  _Montague._ I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
  To hear true shrift.--Come, madam, let's away.
                                       [_Exeunt Montague and Lady._
  _Benvolio._ Good morrow, cousin.
  _Romeo._                         Is the day so young?
  _Benvolio._ But new struck nine.
  _Romeo._                         Ay me! sad hours seem long.
  Was that my father that went hence so fast?
  _Benvolio._ It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?        160
  _Romeo._ Not having that which, having, makes them short.
  _Benvolio._ In love?
  _Romeo._ Out--
  _Benvolio._ Of love?
  _Romeo._ Out of her favour where I am in love.
  _Benvolio._ Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
  Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
  _Romeo._ Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
  Should without eyes see pathways to his will!
  Where shall we dine?--O me! What fray was here?
  Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.                        171
  Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
  Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
  O any thing, of nothing first created!
  O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
  Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
  Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!
  Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
  This love feel I that feel no love in this.
  Dost thou not laugh?
  _Benvolio._                   No, coz, I rather weep.            180
  _Romeo._ Good heart, at what?
  _Benvolio._                   At thy good heart's oppression.
  _Romeo._ Why, such is love's transgression.
  Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
  Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
  With more of thine; this love that thou hast shown
  Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
  Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs;
  Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
  Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears.
  What is it else? a madness most discreet,                        190
  A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.
  Farewell, my coz.
  _Benvolio._       Soft! I will go along;
  An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
  _Romeo._ Tut, I have lost myself, I am not here;
  This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
  _Benvolio._ Tell me in sadness who is that you love.
  _Romeo._ What, shall I groan and tell thee?
  _Benvolio._                       Groan! why, no,
  But sadly tell me who.
