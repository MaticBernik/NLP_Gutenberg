_Dro. S._ Lest it make you choleric, and purchase me
another dry basting.
_Ant. S._ Well, sir, learn to jest in good time: there's a
time for all things.
_Dro. S._ I durst have denied that, before you were so              65
choleric.
_Ant. S._ By what rule, sir?
_Dro. S._ Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain bald
pate of father Time himself.
_Ant. S._ Let's hear it.                                            70
_Dro. S._ There's no time for a man to recover his hair
that grows bald by nature.
_Ant. S._ May he not do it by fine and recovery?
_Dro. S._ Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig, and recover
the lost hair of another man.                                       75
_Ant. S._ Why is Time such a niggard of hair, being, as
it is, so plentiful an excrement?
_Dro. S._ Because it is a blessing that he bestows on
beasts: and what he hath scanted men in hair, he hath
given them in wit.                                                  80
_Ant. S._ Why, but there's many a man hath more hair
than wit.
_Dro. S._ Not a man of those but he hath the wit to
lose his hair.
_Ant. S._ Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain                  85
dealers without wit.
_Dro. S._ The plainer dealer, the sooner lost: yet he
loseth it in a kind of jollity.
_Ant. S._ For what reason?
_Dro. S._ For two; and sound ones too.                              90
_Ant. S._ Nay, not sound, I pray you.
_Dro. S._ Sure ones, then.
_Ant. S._ Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.
_Dro. S._ Certain ones, then.
_Ant. S._ Name them.                                                95
_Dro. S._ The one, to save the money that he spends in
trimming; the other, that at dinner they should not drop
in his porridge.
_Ant. S._ You would all this time have proved there is
no time for all things.                                            100
_Dro. S._ Marry, and did, sir; namely, no time to recover
hair lost by nature.
_Ant. S._ But your reason was not substantial, why
there is no time to recover.
_Dro. S._ Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald, and                105
therefore to the world's end will have bald followers.
_Ant. S._ I knew 'twould be a bald conclusion:
But, soft! who wafts us yonder?
  _Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA._
_Adr._ Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown:
Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects;                        110
I am not Adriana nor thy wife.
The time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow
That never words were music to thine ear,
That never object pleasing in thine eye,
That never touch well welcome to thy hand,                         115
That never meat sweet-savour'd in thy taste,
Unless I spake, or look'd, or touch'd, or carved to thee.
How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it,
That thou art then estranged from thyself?
Thyself I call it, being strange to me,                            120
That, undividable, incorporate,
Am better than thy dear self's better part.
Ah, do not tear away thyself from me!
For know, my love, as easy mayst thou fall
A drop of water in the breaking gulf,                              125
And take unmingled thence that drop again,
Without addition or diminishing,
As take from me thyself, and not me too.
How dearly would it touch thee to the quick,
Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious,                          130
And that this body, consecrate to thee,
By ruffian lust should be contaminate!
Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me,
And hurl the name of husband in my face,
And tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow,                      135
And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring,
And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?
I know thou canst; and therefore see thou do it.
I am possess'd with an adulterate blot;
My blood is mingled with the crime of lust:                        140
For if we two be one, and thou play false,
I do digest the poison of thy flesh,
Being strumpeted by thy contagion.
Keep, then, fair league and truce with thy true bed;
I live distain'd, thou undishonoured.                              145
