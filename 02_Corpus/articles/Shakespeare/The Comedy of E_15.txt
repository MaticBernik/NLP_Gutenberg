_Ang._ You hear how he importunes me;--the chain!
_Ant. E._ Why, give it to my wife, and fetch your money.
_Ang._ Come, come, you know I gave it you even now.                 55
Either send the chain, or send me by some token.
_Ant. E._ Fie, now you run this humour out of breath.
Come, where's the chain? I pray you, let me see it.
_Sec. Mer._ My business cannot brook this dalliance.
Good sir, say whether you'll answer me or no:                       60
If not, I'll leave him to the officer.
_Ant. E._ I answer you! what should I answer you?
_Ang._ The money that you owe me for the chain.
_Ant. E._ I owe you none till I receive the chain.
_Ang._ You know I gave it you half an hour since.                   65
_Ant. E._ You gave me none: you wrong me much to say so.
_Ang._ You wrong me more, sir, in denying it:
Consider how it stands upon my credit.
_Sec. Mer._ Well, officer, arrest him at my suit.
_Off._ I do; and charge you in the duke's name to obey me.          70
_Ang._ This touches me in reputation.
Either consent to pay this sum for me,
Or I attach you by this officer.
_Ant. E._ Consent to pay thee that I never had!
Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou darest.                          75
_Ang._ Here is thy fee; arrest him, officer.
I would not spare my brother in this case,
If he should scorn me so apparently.
_Off._ I do arrest you, sir: you hear the suit.
_Ant. E._ I do obey thee till I give thee bail.                     80
But, sirrah, you shall buy this sport as dear
As all the metal in your shop will answer.
_Ang._ Sir, sir, I shall have law in Ephesus,
To your notorious shame; I doubt it not.
  _Enter _DROMIO of Syracuse_, from the bay._
_Dro. S._ Master, there is a bark of Epidamnum                      85
That stays but till her owner comes aboard,
And then, sir, she bears away. Our fraughtage, sir,
I have convey'd aboard; and I have bought
The oil, the balsamum, and aqua-vitae.
The ship is in her trim; the merry wind                             90
Blows fair from land: they stay for nought at all
But for their owner, master, and yourself.
_Ant. E._ How now! a madman! Why, thou peevish sheep,
What ship of Epidamnum stays for me?
_Dro. S._ A ship you sent me to, to hire waftage.                   95
_Ant. E._ Thou drunken slave, I sent thee for a rope,
And told thee to what purpose and what end.
_Dro. S._ You sent me for a rope's end as soon:
You sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark.
_Ant. E._ I will debate this matter at more leisure,               100
And teach your ears to list me with more heed.
To Adriana, villain, hie thee straight:
Give her this key, and tell her, in the desk
That's cover'd o'er with Turkish tapestry
There is a purse of ducats; let her send it:                       105
Tell her I am arrested in the street,
And that shall bail me: hie thee, slave, be gone!
On, officer, to prison till it come.
