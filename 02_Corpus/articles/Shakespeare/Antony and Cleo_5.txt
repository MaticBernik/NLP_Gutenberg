[Enter ALEXAS.]
ALEXAS.
Sovereign of Egypt, hail!
CLEOPATRA.
How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!
Yet, coming from him, that great medicine hath
With his tinct gilded thee.--
How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?
ALEXAS.
Last thing he did, dear queen,
He kiss'd,--the last of many doubled kisses,--
This orient pearl: his speech sticks in my heart.
CLEOPATRA.
Mine ear must pluck it thence.
ALEXAS.
'Good friend,' quoth he
'Say, the firm Roman to great Egypt sends
This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,
To mend the petty present, I will piece
Her opulent throne with kingdoms; all the east,
Say thou, shall call her mistress.' So he nodded,
And soberly did mount an arm-girt steed,
Who neigh'd so high that what I would have spoke
Was beastly dumb'd by him.
CLEOPATRA.
What, was he sad or merry?
ALEXAS.
Like to the time o' the year between the extremes
Of hot and cold, he was nor sad nor merry.
CLEOPATRA.
O well-divided disposition!--Note him,
Note him, good Charmian; 'tis the man; but note him:
He was not sad,--for he would shine on those
That make their looks by his; he was not merry,--
Which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay
In Egypt with his joy; but between both:
O heavenly mingle!--Be'st thou sad or merry,
The violence of either thee becomes,
So does it no man else.--Mett'st thou my posts?
ALEXAS.
Ay, madam, twenty several messengers.
Why do you send so thick?
CLEOPATRA.
Who's born that day
When I forget to send to Antony
Shall die a beggar.--Ink and paper, Charmian.--
Welcome, my good Alexas.--Did I, Charmian,
Ever love Caesar so?
CHARMIAN.
O that brave Caesar!
CLEOPATRA.
Be chok'd with such another emphasis!
Say 'the brave Antony.'
CHARMIAN.
The valiant Caesar!
CLEOPATRA.
By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth
If thou with Caesar paragon again
My man of men.
CHARMIAN.
By your most gracious pardon,
I sing but after you.
CLEOPATRA.
My salad days,
When I was green in judgment:--cold in blood,
To say as I said then!--But come, away;
Get me ink and paper: he shall have every day
A several greeting,
Or I'll unpeople Egypt.
[Exeunt.]
ACT II.
SCENE I. Messina. A Room in POMPEY'S house.
[Enter POMPEY, MENECRATES, and MENAS.]
POMPEY.
If the great gods be just, they shall assist
The deeds of justest men.
MENECRATES.
Know, worthy Pompey,
That what they do delay they not deny.
POMPEY.
Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decays
The thing we sue for.
MENECRATES.
We, ignorant of ourselves,
Beg often our own harms, which the wise powers
Deny us for our good; so find we profit
By losing of our prayers.
POMPEY.
I shall do well;
The people love me, and the sea is mine;
My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope
Says it will come to the full. Mark Antony
In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make
No wars without doors: Caesar gets money where
He loses hearts: Lepidus flatters both,
Of both is flatter'd; but he neither loves
Nor either cares for him.
