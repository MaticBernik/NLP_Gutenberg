This heauy headed reueale east and west[3]
Makes vs tradust, and taxed of other nations,
They clip[4] vs drunkards, and with Swinish phrase
Soyle our addition,[5] and indeede it takes
From our atchieuements, though perform'd at height[6]
The pith and marrow of our attribute,
So oft it chaunces in particuler men,[7]
That for some vicious mole[8] of nature in them
As in their birth wherein they are not guilty,[8]
(Since nature cannot choose his origin)
By their ore-grow'th of some complextion[10]
Oft breaking downe the pales and forts of reason
Or by[11] some habit, that too much ore-leauens
The forme of plausiue[12] manners, that[13] these men
Carrying I say the stamp of one defect
Being Natures liuery, or Fortunes starre,[14]
His[15] vertues els[16] be they as pure as grace,
As infinite as man may vndergoe,[17]
Shall in the generall censure[18] take corruption
From that particuler fault:[19] the dram of eale[20]
Doth all the noble substance of a doubt[21]
To his[22] owne scandle.]
[Footnote 1: Does Hamlet here call his uncle an _upspring_, an
_upstart_? or is the _upspring_ a dance, the English equivalent of 'the
high _lavolt_' of _Troil. and Cress_. iv. 4, and governed by
_reels_--'keeps wassels, and reels the swaggering upspring'--a dance
that needed all the steadiness as well as agility available, if, as I
suspect, it was that in which each gentleman lifted the lady high, and
kissed her before setting her down? I cannot answer, I can only put the
question. The word _swaggering_ makes me lean to the former
interpretation.]
[Footnote 2: Observe again Hamlet's uncertainty. He does not take it for
granted that it is _his father's_ spirit, though it is plainly his
form.]
[Footnote 3: The Quarto surely came too early for this passage to have
been suggested by the shameful habits which invaded the court through
the example of Anne of Denmark! Perhaps Shakspere cancelled it both
because he would not have it supposed he had meant to reflect on the
queen, and because he came to think it too diffuse.]
[Footnote 4: clepe, _call_.]
[Footnote 5: Same as _attribute_, two lines lower--the thing imputed to,
or added to us--our reputation, our title or epithet.]
[Footnote 6: performed to perfection.]
[Footnote 7: individuals.]
[Footnote 8: A mole on the body, according to the place where it
appeared, was regarded as significant of character: in that relation, a
_vicious mole_ would be one that indicated some special vice; but here
the allusion is to a live mole of constitutional fault, burrowing
within, whose presence the mole-_heap_ on the skin indicates.]
[Footnote 9: The order here would be: 'for some vicious mole of nature
in them, as by their o'er-growth, in their birth--wherein they are not
guilty, since nature cannot choose his origin (or parentage)--their
o'ergrowth of (their being overgrown or possessed by) some complexion,
&c.']
[Footnote 10: _Complexion_, as the exponent of the _temperament_, or
masterful tendency of the nature, stands here for _temperament_--'oft
breaking down &c.' Both words have in them the element of _mingling_--a
mingling to certain results.]
