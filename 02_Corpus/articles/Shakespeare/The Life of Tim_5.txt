TIMON.
I'll hunt with him; and let them be receiv'd,
Not without fair reward.
FLAVIUS.
[Aside.] What will this come to?
He commands us to provide, and give great gifts,
And all out of an empty coffer;
Nor will he know his purse, or yield me this,
To show him what a beggar his heart is,
Being of no power to make his wishes good.
His promises fly so beyond his state
That what he speaks is all in debt; he owes
For every word: he is so kind that he now
Pays interest for 't; his land's put to their books.
Well, would I were gently put out of office
Before I were forc'd out!
Happier he that has no friend to feed
Than such that do e'en enemies exceed.
I bleed inwardly for my lord.
[Exit.]
TIMON.
You do yourselves much wrong;
You bate too much of your own merits;
Here, my lord, a trifle of our love.
SECOND LORD.
With more than common thanks I will receive it.
THIRD LORD.
O! he's the very soul of bounty!
TIMON.
And now I remember, my lord, you gave
Good words the other day of a bay courser
I rode on: it is yours because you lik'd it.
THIRD LORD.
O! I beseech you, pardon me, my lord, in that.
TIMON.
You may take my word, my lord: I know no man
Can justly praise but what he does affect:
I weigh my friend's affection with mine own.
I'll tell you true; I'll call to you.
ALL LORDS.
O! none so welcome!
TIMON.
I take all and your several visitations
So kind to heart, 'tis not enough to give;
Methinks, I could deal kingdoms to my friends,
And ne'er be weary. Alcibiades,
Thou art a soldier, therefore seldom rich;
It comes in charity to thee; for all thy living
Is 'mongst the dead, and all the lands thou hast
Lie in a pitch'd field.
ALCIBIADES.
Ay, defil'd land, my lord.
FIRST LORD.
We are so virtuously bound,--
TIMON.
And so am I to you.
SECOND LORD.
So infinitely endear'd,--
TIMON.
All to you. Lights, more lights!
FIRST LORD.
The best of happiness,
Honour, and fortunes, keep with you, Lord Timon!
TIMON.
Ready for his friends.
[Exeunt ALCIBIADES, Lords, and etc.].]
APEMANTUS.
What a coil's here!
Serving of becks and jutting out of bums!
I doubt whether their legs be worth the sums
That are given for 'em. Friendship's full of dregs:
Methinks, false hearts should never have sound legs.
Thus honest fools lay out their wealth on curtsies.
TIMON.
Now, Apemantus, if thou wert not sullen,
I would be good to thee.
APEMANTUS.
No, I'll nothing; for if I should be bribed too, there
would be none left to rail upon thee, and then thou wouldst sin
the faster. Thou givest so long, Timon, I fear me thou wilt give
away thyself in paper shortly: What needs these feasts, pomps,
and vain-glories?
TIMON.
Nay, an you begin to rail on society once, I am sworn not to
give regard to you. Farewell; and come with better music.
