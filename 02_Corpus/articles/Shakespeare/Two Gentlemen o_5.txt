_Speed._ You never saw her since she was deformed.
_Val._ How long hath she been deformed?
_Speed._ Ever since you loved her.
_Val._ I have loved her ever since I saw her; and still I
see her beautiful.                                                  60
_Speed._ If you love her, you cannot see her.
_Val._ Why?
_Speed._ Because Love is blind. O, that you had mine
eyes; or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to
have when you chid at Sir Proteus for going ungartered!             65
_Val._ What should I see then?
_Speed._ Your own present folly, and her passing deformity:
for he, being in love, could not see to garter his
hose; and you, being in love, cannot see to put on your hose.
_Val._ Belike, boy, then, you are in love; for last morning         70
you could not see to wipe my shoes.
_Speed._ True, sir; I was in love with my bed: I thank
you, you swinged me for my love, which makes me the
bolder to chide you for yours.
_Val._ In conclusion, I stand affected to her.                      75
_Speed._ I would you were set, so your affection would
cease.
_Val._ Last night she enjoined me to write some lines
to one she loves.
_Speed._ And have you?                                              80
_Val._ I have.
_Speed._ Are they not lamely writ?
_Val._ No, boy, but as well as I can do them. Peace!
here she comes.
_Speed._ [_Aside_] O excellent motion! O exceeding puppet!          85
Now will he interpret to her.
  _Enter SILVIA._
_Val._ Madam and mistress, a thousand good-morrows.
_Speed._ [_Aside_] O, give ye good even! here's a million
of manners.
_Sil._ Sir Valentine and servant, to you two thousand.              90
_Speed._ [_Aside_] He should give her interest, and she
gives it him.
_Val._ As you enjoin'd me, I have writ your letter
Unto the secret nameless friend of yours;
Which I was much unwilling to proceed in,                           95
But for my duty to your ladyship.
_Sil._ I thank you, gentle servant: 'tis very clerkly done.
_Val._ Now trust me, madam, it came hardly off;
For, being ignorant to whom it goes,
I writ at random, very doubtfully.                                 100
_Sil._ Perchance you think too much of so much pains?
_Val._ No, madam; so it stead you, I will write,
Please you command, a thousand times as much;
And yet--
_Sil._ A pretty period! Well, I guess the sequel;                  105
And yet I will not name it;--and yet I care not;--
And yet take this again:--and yet I thank you;
Meaning henceforth to trouble you no more.
_Speed._ [_Aside_] And yet you will; and yet another 'yet.'
_Val._ What means your ladyship? do you not like it?               110
_Sil._ Yes, yes: the lines are very quaintly writ;
But since unwillingly, take them again.
Nay, take them.
_Val._ Madam, they are for you.
_Sil._ Ay, ay: you writ them, sir, at my request;                  115
But I will none of them; they are for you;
I would have had them writ more movingly.
_Val._ Please you, I'll write your ladyship another.
