On _Friday_ Morning it continued to blow exceeding hard, but not so as
that it gave any Apprehensions of Danger within Doors; towards Night it
encreased: and about 10 a Clock, our Barometers inform'd us that the
Night would be very tempestuous; the _Mercury_ sunk lower than ever I
had observ'd it on any Occasion whatsoever, which made me suppose the
Tube had been handled and disturb'd by the Children.
But as my Observations of this Nature are not regular enough to supply
the Reader with a full Information, the Disorders of that dreadful Night
having found me other Imployment, expecting every Moment when the House
I was in would bury us all in its own Ruins; I have therefore subjoin'd
a Letter from an Ingenious Gentleman on this very Head, directed to the
_Royal Society_, and printed in the _Philosophical Transactions_, No.
289. P. 1530. as follows.
    _A Letter from the Reverend Mr._ William Derham, _F.R.S. Containing
    his Observations concerning the late Storm_.
    _SIR_,
    According to my Promise at the general Meeting of the _R.S._ on St.
    _Andrews_ Day, I here send you inclos'd the Account of my Ingenious
    and Inquisitive Friend _Richard Townely_, Esq; concerning the State
    of the Atmosphere in that Part of _Lancashire_ where he liveth, in
    the late dismal Storm. And I hope it will not be unaccepable, to
    accompany his with my own Observations at _Upminster_; especially
    since I shall not weary you with a long History of the Devastations,
    _&c._ but rather some Particulars of a more Philosophical
    Consideration.
    And first, I do not think it improper to look back to the preceding
    Seasons of the Year. I scarce believe I shall go out of the way, to
    reflect as far back as _April_, _May_, _June_ and _July_; because
    all these were wet Months in our Southern Parts. In _April_ there
    fell 12,49 _l._ of Rain through my Tunnel: And about 6, 7, 8, or 9,
    _l._ I esteem a moderate quantity for _Upminster. In_ May _there
    fell more than in any Month of any Year since the Year 1696_, viz.
    20,77 _l. June_ likewise was a dripping Month, in which fell 14,55
    _l._ And _July_, although it had considerable Intermissions, yet had
    14,19 _l._ above 11 _l._ of which fell on _July_ 28_th_ and 29_th_
    in violent Showers. And I remember the News Papers gave Accounts of
    great Rains that Month from divers Places of _Europe_; but the
    _North of England_ (which also escaped the Violence of the late
    Storm) was not so remarkably wet in any of those Months; at least
    not in that great proportion more than we, as usually they are; as I
    guess from the Tables of Rain, with which Mr. _Towneley_ hath
    favoured me. Particularly _July_ was a dry Month with them, there
    being no more than 3,65 _l._ of Rain fell through Mr. _Towneley's_
    Tunnel of the same Diameter with mine.
    From these Months let us pass to _September_, and that we shall
    find to have been a wet Month, especially the latter part of it;
    there fell of Rain in that Month, 14,86 _l._
