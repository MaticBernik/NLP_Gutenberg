[_Enter_ LORD WINDERMERE _L.U.E._]
LORD WINDERMERE.  Have you said good-night to my wife?  [_Comes C._]
MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_Crushing letter in her hand_.]  Yes.
LORD WINDERMERE.  Where is she?
MRS. ERLYNNE.  She is very tired.  She has gone to bed.  She said she had
a headache.
LORD WINDERMERE.  I must go to her.  Youll excuse me?
MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_Rising hurriedly_.]  Oh, no!  Its nothing serious.
Shes only very tired, that is all.  Besides, there are people still in
the supper-room.  She wants you to make her apologies to them.  She said
she didnt wish to be disturbed.  [_Drops letter_.]  She asked me to tell
you!
LORD WINDERMERE.  [_Picks up letter_.]  You have dropped something.
MRS. ERLYNNE.  Oh yes, thank you, that is mine.  [_Puts out her hand to
take it_.]
LORD WINDERMERE.  [_Still looking at letter_.]  But its my wifes
handwriting, isnt it?
MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_Takes the letter quickly_.]  Yes, itsan address.  Will
you ask them to call my carriage, please?
LORD WINDERMERE.  Certainly.
                                                     [_Goes L. and Exit_.]
MRS. ERLYNNE.  Thanks!  What can I do?  What can I do?  I feel a passion
awakening within me that I never felt before.  What can it mean?  The
daughter must not be like the motherthat would be terrible.  How can I
save her?  How can I save my child?  A moment may ruin a life.  Who knows
that better than I?  Windermere must be got out of the house; that is
absolutely necessary.  [_Goes L._]  But how shall I do it?  It must be
done somehow.  Ah!
[_Enter_ LORD AUGUSTUS _R.U.E. carrying bouquet_.]
LORD AUGUSTUS.  Dear lady, I am in such suspense!  May I not have an
answer to my request?
MRS. ERLYNNE.  Lord Augustus, listen to me.  You are to take Lord
Windermere down to your club at once, and keep him there as long as
possible.  You understand?
LORD AUGUSTUS.  But you said you wished me to keep early hours!
MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_Nervously_.]  Do what I tell you.  Do what I tell you.
LORD AUGUSTUS.  And my reward?
MRS. ERLYNNE.  Your reward?  Your reward?  Oh! ask me that to-morrow.
But dont let Windermere out of your sight to-night.  If you do I will
never forgive you.  I will never speak to you again.  Ill have nothing
to do with you.  Remember you are to keep Windermere at your club, and
dont let him come back to-night.
                                                               [_Exit L._]
LORD AUGUSTUS.  Well, really, I might be her husband already.  Positively
I might.  [_Follows her in a bewildered manner_.]

THIRD ACT
                                  SCENE
_Lord Darlingtons Rooms_.  _A large sofa is in front of fireplace R._
_At the back of the stage a curtain is drawn across the window_.  _Doors
L. and R._  _Table R. with writing materials.  Table C. with syphons,
glasses, and Tantalus frame_.  _Table L. with cigar and cigarette box.
Lamps lit_.
LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Standing by the fireplace_.]  Why doesnt he come?
This waiting is horrible.  He should be here.  Why is he not here, to
wake by passionate words some fire within me?  I am coldcold as a
loveless thing.  Arthur must have read my letter by this time.  If he
cared for me, he would have come after me, would have taken me back by
force.  But he doesnt care.  Hes entrammelled by this womanfascinated
by herdominated by her.  If a woman wants to hold a man, she has merely
to appeal to what is worst in him.  We make gods of men and they leave
us.  Others make brutes of them and they fawn and are faithful.  How
hideous life is! . . . Oh! it was mad of me to come here, horribly mad.
And yet, which is the worst, I wonder, to be at the mercy of a man who
loves one, or the wife of a man who in ones own house dishonours one?
What woman knows?  What woman in the whole world?  But will he love me
always, this man to whom I am giving my life?  What do I bring him?  Lips
that have lost the note of joy, eyes that are blinded by tears, chill
hands and icy heart.  I bring him nothing.  I must go backno; I cant go
back, my letter has put me in their powerArthur would not take me back!
That fatal letter!  No!  Lord Darlington leaves England to-morrow.  I
will go with himI have no choice.  [_Sits down for a few moments_.
_Then starts up and puts on her cloak_.]  No, no!  I will go back, let
Arthur do with me what he pleases.  I cant wait here.  It has been
madness my coming.  I must go at once.  As for Lord DarlingtonOh! here
he is!  What shall I do?  What can I say to him?  Will he let me go away
at all?  I have heard that men are brutal, horrible . . . Oh!  [_Hides
her face in her hands_.]
