KAIA.
Here are all the drawings.
SOLNESS.
Good. Put them down there on the table.
KAIA.
[Putting down the portfolio.] Good night, then. [Beseechingly.] And
please, please think kindly of me.
SOLNESS.
Oh, that I always do. Good-night, my dear little Kaia. [Glances to the
right.] Go, go now!
  MRS. SOLNESS and DR. HERDAL enter by the door on the right.
  He is a stoutish, elderly man, with a round, good-humoured
  face, clean shaven, with thin, light hair, and gold spectacles.
MRS. SOLNESS.
[Still in the doorway.] Halvard, I cannot keep the doctor any longer.
SOLNESS.
Well then, come in here.
MRS. SOLNESS.
[To KAIA, who is turning down the desk-lamp.] Have you finished the
letter already, Miss Fosli?
KAIA.
[In confusion.] The letter--?
SOLNESS.
Yes, it was quite a short one.
MRS. SOLNESS.
It must have been very short.
SOLNESS.
You may go now, Miss Fosli. And please come in good time to-morrow
morning.
KAIA.
I will be sure to. Good-night, Mrs. Solness.
     [She goes out by the hall door.
SOLNESS.
Are you in a hurry, doctor?
DR. HERDAL.
No, not at all.
SOLNESS.
May I have a little chat with you?
DR. HERDAL.
With the greatest of pleasure.
SOLNESS.
Then let us sit down. [He motions the doctor to take the rocking-chair,
and sits down himself in the arm-chair. Looks searchingly at him.] Tell
me--did you notice anything odd about Aline?
DR. HERDAL.
Do you mean just now, when she was here?
SOLNESS.
Yes, in her manner to me. Did you notice anything?
DR. HERDAL.
[Smiling.] Well, I admit--one couldn't well avoid noticing that your
wife--h'm--
DR. HERDAL. --that your wife is not particularly fond of this Miss
Fosli.
SOLNESS.
Is that all? I have noticed that myself.
DR. HERDAL.
And I must say I am scarcely surprised at it.
SOLNESS.
At what?
DR. HERDAL.
That she should not exactly approve of your seeing so much of another
woman, all day and every day.
SOLNESS.
No, no, I suppose you are right there--and Aline too. But it's
impossible to make any change.
DR. HERDAL.
Could you not engage a clerk?
SOLNESS.
The first man that came to hand? No, thank you--that would never do for
me.
DR. HERDAL.
But now, if your wife--? Suppose, with her delicate health, all this
tries her too much?
SOLNESS.
Even then--I might almost say--it can make no difference. I must keep
Kaia Fosli. No one else could fill her place.
DR. HERDAL.
No one else?
SOLNESS.
[Curtly.] No, no one.
DR. HERDAL.
[Drawing his chair closer.] Now listen to me, my dear Mr. Solness. May I
ask you a question, quite between ourselves?
SOLNESS.
By all means.
DR. HERDAL.
Women, you see--in certain matters, they have a deucedly keen
intuition--
SOLNESS.
They have, indeed. There is not the least doubt of that. But--?
DR. HERDAL.
Well, tell me now--if your wife can't endure this Kaia Fosli--?
SOLNESS.
Well, what then?
DR. HERDAL. --may she not have just--just the least little bit of reason
for this instinctive dislike?
