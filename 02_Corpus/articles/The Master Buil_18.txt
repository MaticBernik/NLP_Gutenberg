SOLNESS.
No, no, no! The younger generation--it means retribution, you see. It
comes, as if under a new banner, heralding the turn of fortune.
HILDA.
[Rises, looks at him, and says with a quivering twitch of her lips.] Can
_I_ be of any use to you, Mr. Solness?
SOLNESS.
Yes, you can indeed! For you, too, come--under a new banner it seems to
me. You marshalled against youth--!
  DR. HERDAL comes in by the hall-door.
DR. HERDAL.
What--you and Miss Wangel here still?
SOLNESS.
Yes. We have had no end of things to talk about.
HILDA.
Both old and new.
DR. HERDAL.
Have you really?
HILDA.
Oh, it has been the greatest fun. For Mr. Solness--he has such a
miraculous memory. All the least little details he remembers instantly.
  MRS. SOLNESS enters by the door on the right.
MRS. SOLNESS.
Well, Miss Wangel, your room is quite ready for you now.
HILDA.
Oh, how kind you are to me!
SOLNESS.
[To MRS. SOLNESS.] The nursery?
MRS. SOLNESS.
Yes, the middle one. But first let us go in to supper.
SOLNESS.
[Nods to HILDA.] Hilda shall sleep in the nursery, she shall.
MRS. SOLNESS.
[Looks at him.] Hilda?
SOLNESS.
Yes, Miss Wangel's name is Hilda. I knew her when she was a child.
MRS. SOLNESS.
Did you really, Halvard? Well, shall we go?
     [She takes DR. HERDAL's arm and goes out with him to the
       right.  HILDA has meanwhile been collecting her travelling
       things.
HILDA.
[Softly and rapidly to SOLNESS.] Is it true, what you said? Can I be of
use to you?
SOLNESS.
[Takes the things from her.] You are the very being I have needed most.
HILDA.
[Looks at him with happy, wondering eyes and clasps her hands.] But
then, great heavens--!
SOLNESS.
[Eagerly.] What--?
HILDA.
Then I have my kingdom!
SOLNESS.
[Involuntarily.] Hilda--!
HILDA.
[Again with the quivering twitch of her lips.] Almost--I was going to
say.
     [She goes out to the right, SOLNESS follows her.
ACT SECOND.
  A prettily furnished small drawing-room in SOLNESS'S house.
  In the back, a glass-door leading out to the verandah and
  garden.  The right-hand corner is cut off transversely by
  a large bay-window, in which are flower-stands.  The left-
  hand corner is similarly cut off by a transverse wall, in
  which is a small door papered like the wall.  On each side,
  an ordinary door.  In front, on the right, a console table
  with a large mirror over it.  Well-filled stands of plants
  and flowers.  In front, on the left, a sofa with a table
  and chairs.  Further back, a bookcase.  Well forward in the
  room, before the bay window, a small table and some chairs.
  It is early in the day.
  SOLNESS sits by the little table with RAGNAR BROVIK'S
  portfolio open in front of him.  He is turning the drawings
  over and closely examining some of them.  MRS. SOLNESS moves
  about noiselessly with a small watering-pot, attending to her
  flowers.  She is dressed in black as before.  Her hat, cloak
  and parasol lie on a chair near the mirror.  Unobserved by her,
  SOLNESS now and again follows her with his eyes.  Neither of
  them speaks.
