_Escal._ How dost thou know that, constable?                        75
_Elb._ Marry, sir, by my wife; who, if she had been a
woman cardinally given, might have been accused in fornication,
adultery, and all uncleanliness there.
_Escal._ By the woman's means?
_Elb._ Ay, sir, by Mistress Overdone's means: but as she            80
spit in his face, so she defied him.
_Pom._ Sir, if it please your honour, this is not so.
_Elb._ Prove it before these varlets here, thou honourable
man; prove it.
_Escal._ Do you hear how he misplaces?                              85
_Pom._ Sir, she came in great with child; and longing,
saving your honour's reverence, for stewed prunes; sir, we
had but two in the house, which at that very distant time
stood, as it were, in a fruit-dish, a dish of some three-pence;
your honours have seen such dishes; they are not China              90
dishes, but very good dishes,--
_Escal._ Go to, go to: no matter for the dish, sir.
_Pom._ No, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein in
the right: but to the point. As I say, this Mistress Elbow,
being, as I say, with child, and being great-bellied, and           95
longing, as I said, for prunes; and having but two in the
dish, as I said, Master Froth here, this very man, having
eaten the rest, as I said, and, as I say, paying for them
very honestly; for, as you know, Master Froth, I could not
give you three-pence again.                                        100
_Froth._ No, indeed.
_Pom._ Very well;--you being then, if you be remembered,
cracking the stones of the foresaid prunes,--
_Froth._ Ay, so I did indeed.
_Pom._ Why, very well; I telling you then, if you be remembered,   105
that such a one and such a one were past cure
of the thing you wot of, unless they kept very good diet, as
I told you,--
_Froth._ All this is true.
_Pom._ Why, very well, then,--                                     110
_Escal._ Come, you are a tedious fool: to the purpose.
What was done to Elbow's wife, that he hath cause to complain
of? Come me to what was done to her.
_Pom._ Sir, your honour cannot come to that yet.
_Escal._ No, sir, nor I mean it not.                               115
_Pom._ Sir, but you shall come to it, by your honour's
leave. And, I beseech you, look into Master Froth here,
sir; a man of fourscore pound a year; whose father died at
Hallowmas:--was't not at Hallowmas, Master Froth?--
_Froth._ All-hallond eve.                                          120
_Pom._ Why, very well; I hope here be truths. He, sir,
sitting, as I say, in a lower chair, sir; 'twas in the Bunch of
Grapes, where, indeed, you have a delight to sit, have you
not?
_Froth._ I have so; because it is an open room, and                125
good for winter.
_Pom._ Why, very well, then; I hope here be truths.
_Ang._ This will last out a night in Russia,
When nights are longest there: I'll take my leave,
And leave you to the hearing of the cause;                         130
Hoping you'll find good cause to whip them all.
