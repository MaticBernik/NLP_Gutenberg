ACT SECOND
The great gallery on the first floor of the Rentheim House.
    The walls are covered with old tapestries, representing
    hunting-scenes, shepherds and shepherdesses, all in faded
    colours.  A folding-door to the left, and further forward a
    piano.  In the left-hand corner, at the back, a door, cut in
    the tapestry, and covered with tapestry, without any frame.
    Against the middle of the right wall, a large writing-table of
    carved oak, with many books and papers.  Further forward on
    the same side, a sofa with a table and chairs in front of it.
    The furniture is all of a stiff Empire style.  Lighted lamps
    on both tables.
JOHN GABRIEL BORKMAN stands with his hands behind his back, beside
    the piano, listening to FRIDA FOLDAL, who is playing the last
    bars of the "Danse Macabre."
BORKMAN is of middle height, a well-knit, powerfully-built man,
    well on in the sixties.  His appearance is distinguished,
    his profile finely cut, his eyes piercing, his hair and
    beard curly and greyish-white.  He is dressed in a slightly
    old-fashioned black coat, and wears a white necktie.  FRIDA
    FOLDAL is a pretty, pale girl of fifteen, with a somewhat
    weary and overstrained expression.  She is cheaply dressed in
    light colours.
BORKMAN.
  Can you guess where I first heard tones like these?
FRIDA.
  [Looking up at him.]  No, Mr. Borkman.
BORKMAN.
  It was down in the mines.
FRIDA.
  [Not understanding.]  Indeed?  Down in the mines?
BORKMAN.
  I am a miner's son, you know.  Or perhaps you did not know?
FRIDA.
  No, Mr. Borkman.
BORKMAN.
  A miner's son.  And my father used sometimes to take me with
him into the mines.  The metal sings down there.
FRIDA.
  Really?  Sings?
BORKMAN.
  [Nodding.]  When it is loosened.  The hammer-strokes that loosen
it are the midnight bell clanging to set it free; and that is why
the metal sings--in its own way--for gladness.
FRIDA.
  Why does it do that, Mr. Borkman?
BORKMAN.
  It wants to come up into the light of day and serve mankind.
     [He paces up and down the gallery, always with his hands
        behind his back.
FRIDA.
  [Sits waiting a little, then looks at her watch and rises.]
I beg your pardon, Mr. Borkman; but I am afraid I must go.
BORKMAN.
  [Stopping before her.]  Are you going already?
FRIDA.
  [Putting her music in its case.]  I really must.  [Visibly
embarrassed.]  I have an engagement this evening.
BORKMAN.
  For a party?
FRIDA.
  Yes.
BORKMAN.
  And you are to play before the company?
FRIDA.
  [Biting her lip.]  No; at least I am only to play for dancing.
BORKMAN.
  Only for dancing?
FRIDA.
  Yes; there is to be a dance after supper.
BORKMAN.
  [Stands and looks at her.]  Do you like playing dance music?
At parties, I mean?
FRIDA.
  [Putting on her outdoor things.]  Yes, when I can get an
engagement.  I can always earn a little in that way.
BORKMAN.
  [With interest.]  Is that the principal thing in your mind as
you sit playing for the dancers?
FRIDA.
  No; I'm generally thinking how hard it is that I mayn't join
in the dance myself.
