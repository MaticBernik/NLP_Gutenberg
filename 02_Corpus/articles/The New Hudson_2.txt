translation shows in more than one place the influence of Shakespeare's
play. For example, Hamlet's exclamation before he kills Polonius, "A
rat! a rat!" is in the English version, but there is no suggestion of it
in the French original.]
II. DATE OF COMPOSITION
Modern editors fix the date of composition of _Julius Caesar_ within
1601, the later time limit (_terminus ante quem_), and 1598, the earlier
time limit (_terminus post quem_). The weight of evidence is in favor of
1600-1601.
EXTERNAL EVIDENCE
1. _Negative._ _Julius Caesar_ is not mentioned by Meres in the
_Palladis Tamia_, published in 1598, which gives a list of twelve
noteworthy Shakespeare plays in existence at that time. This establishes
1598 as a probable _terminus post quem_.
2. _Positive._ In John Weever's _Mirror of Martyrs or the Life and Death
of Sir John Oldcastle Knight, Lord Cobham_, printed in 1601, are the
following lines:
  The many-headed multitude were drawne
  By _Brutus_ speech that _Caesar_ was ambitious,
  When eloquent _Mark Antonie_ had showne
  His vertues, who but _Brutus_ then was vicious?
      Man's memorie, with new, forgets the old,
      One tale is good, until another's told.
Halliwell-Phillipps was the first to note that here is a very pointed
reference to the second scene of the third act of _Julius Caesar_, as
the antithesis brought out is not indicated in any of Shakespeare's
historical sources. The fact that Weever states in his Dedication that
the _Mirror_ "some two years agoe was made fit for the print" has been
held by Mr. Percy Simpson[1] to indicate that the play was not brought
out later than 1599, a conclusion supported, he thinks, by a passage in
Ben Jonson's _Every Man out of His Humour_, produced in that year, where
Clove (III, i) says, "Then coming to the pretty animal, as _Reason long
since is fled to animals_, you know," which may be a sneering allusion
to Antony's "O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts" (III, ii,
104). The "_Et tu, Brute_" quotation in the same play has been used to
strengthen the argument. But the lines from the _Mirror of Martyrs_
quoted above may easily have been inserted by Weever into his poem in
consequence of the popularity of Shakespeare's play. This contemporary
popularity is well attested. Leonard Digges,[2] in his verses _Upon
Master William Shakespeare_ prefixed to the 1640 edition of
Shakespeare's Poems, thus compares it with that of Ben Jonson's Roman
plays:
  So have I seene, when Cesar would appeare,
  And on the Stage at halfe-sword parley were
  _Brutus_ and _Cassius_: oh how the Audience
  Were ravish'd, with what new wonder they went thence,
  When some new day they would not brooke a line
  Of tedious (though well laboured) _Catiline_;
  _Sejanus_ too was irkesome, they priz'de more
  Honest _Iago_, or the jealous _Moore_.

deceased Authour Maister W. Shakespeare," prefixed to the First Folio.]
