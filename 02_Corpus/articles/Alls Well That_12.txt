BERTRAM.
Pardon, my gracious lord; for I submit
My fancy to your eyes: when I consider
What great creation, and what dole of honour
Flies where you bid it, I find that she, which late
Was in my nobler thoughts most base, is now
The praised of the king; who, so ennobled,
Is as 'twere born so.
KING.
Take her by the hand,
And tell her she is thine: to whom I promise
A counterpoise; if not to thy estate,
A balance more replete.
BERTRAM.
I take her hand.
KING.
Good fortune and the favour of the king
Smile upon this contract; whose ceremony
Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief,
And be perform'd to-night: the solemn feast
Shall more attend upon the coming space,
Expecting absent friends. As thou lov'st her,
Thy love's to me religious; else, does err.
[Exeunt KING, BERTAM, HELENA, Lords, and Attendants.]
LAFEU.
Do you hear, monsieur? a word with you.
PAROLLES.
Your pleasure, sir?
LAFEU.
Your lord and master did well to make his recantation.
PAROLLES.
Recantation!--my lord! my master!
LAFEU.
Ay; is it not a language I speak?
PAROLLES.
A most harsh one, and not to be understood without bloody
succeeding. My master!
LAFEU.
Are you companion to the Count Rousillon?
PAROLLES.
To any count; to all counts; to what is man.
LAFEU.
To what is count's man: count's master is of another style.
PAROLLES.
You are too old, sir; let it satisfy you, you are too old.
LAFEU.
I must tell thee, sirrah, I write man; to which title age cannot
bring thee.
PAROLLES.
What I dare too well do, I dare not do.
LAFEU.
I did think thee, for two ordinaries, to be a pretty wise
fellow; thou didst make tolerable vent of thy travel; it might
pass: yet the scarfs and the bannerets about thee did manifoldly
dissuade me from believing thee a vessel of too great a burden. I
have now found thee; when I lose thee again I care not: yet art
thou good for nothing but taking up; and that thou art scarce
worth.
PAROLLES.
Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee,--
LAFEU.
Do not plunge thyself too far in anger, lest thou hasten thy
trial; which if--Lord have mercy on thee for a hen! So, my good
window of lattice, fare thee well: thy casement I need not open,
for I look through thee. Give me thy hand.
PAROLLES.
My lord, you give me most egregious indignity.
LAFEU.
Ay, with all my heart; and thou art worthy of it.
PAROLLES.
I have not, my lord, deserved it.
LAFEU.
Yes, good faith, every dram of it: and I will not bate thee
a scruple.
PAROLLES.
Well, I shall be wiser.
LAFEU.
E'en as soon as thou canst, for thou hast to pull at a smack
o' th' contrary. If ever thou beest bound in thy scarf and
beaten, thou shalt find what it is to be proud of thy bondage. I
have a desire to hold my acquaintance with thee, or rather my
knowledge, that I may say in the default, he is a man I know.
