[Footnote 3: 'No more' makes a new line in the _Quarto_.]
[Footnote 4: I think this speech should end with a point of
interrogation.]
[Footnote 5: muscles.]
[Footnote 6: The body is the temple, in which the mind and soul are the
worshippers: their service grows with the temple--wide, changing and
increasing its objects. The degraded use of the grand image is after the
character of him who makes it.]
[Footnote 7: The studied contrast between Laertes and Hamlet begins
already to appear: the dishonest man, honestly judging after his own
dishonesty, warns his sister against the honest man.]
[Footnote 8: deceit.]
[Footnote 9: 'You have cause to fear when you consider his greatness:
his will &c.' 'You must fear, his greatness being weighed; for because
of that greatness, his will is not his own.']
[Footnote 10: _This line not in Quarto._]
[Footnote 11: limited.]
[Footnote 12: allowance.]
[Footnote 13: This change from the _Quarto_ seems to me to bear the mark
of Shakspere's hand. The meaning is the same, but the words are more
individual and choice: the _sect_, the _head_ in relation to the body,
is more pregnant than _place_; and _force_, that is _power_, is a fuller
word than _act_, or even _action_, for which it plainly appears to
stand.]

Then the maine voyce of _Denmarke_ goes withall.
Then weigh what losse your Honour may sustaine,
If with too credent eare you list his Songs;
Or lose your Heart; or your chast Treasure open     [Sidenote: Or loose]
To his vnmastred[1] importunity.
Feare it _Ophelia_, feare it my deare Sister,
And keepe within the reare of your Affection;[2]
                                            [Sidenote: keepe you in the]
Out of the shot and danger of Desire.
The chariest Maid is Prodigall enough,                   [Sidenote: The]
If she vnmaske her beauty to the Moone:[3]
Vertue it selfe scapes not calumnious stroakes,       [Sidenote: Vertue]
The Canker Galls, the Infants of the Spring

Too oft before the buttons[6] be disclos'd,    [Sidenote: their buttons]
And in the Morne and liquid dew of Youth,
Contagious blastments are most imminent.
Be wary then, best safety lies in feare;
Youth to it selfe rebels, though none else neere.[6]
_Ophe_. I shall th'effect of this good Lesson keepe,
As watchmen to my heart: but good my Brother        [Sidenote: watchman]
Doe not as some vngracious Pastors doe,
Shew me the steepe and thorny way to Heauen;
Whilst like a puft and recklesse Libertine
Himselfe, the Primrose path of dalliance treads,
And reaks not his owne reade.[7][8][9]
_Laer_. Oh, feare me not.[10]
_Enter Polonius_.
I stay too long; but here my Father comes:
A double blessing is a double grace;
Occasion smiles vpon a second leaue.[11]
_Polon_. Yet heere _Laertes_? Aboord, aboord for shame,
The winde sits in the shoulder of your saile,
And you are staid for there: my blessing with you;
                                   [Sidenote: for, there my | with thee]

your liking. Do not go to the front with your impulse.]
