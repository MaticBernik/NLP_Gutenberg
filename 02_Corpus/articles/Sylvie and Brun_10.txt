Its a new way of looking at itto me, she said; but it seems a
_true_ way, also. However, I wont deal in generalities, with an old
friend like you! For we _are_ old friends, somehow. Do you know, I think
we _began_ as old friends? she said with a playfulness of tone that ill
accorded with the tears that glistened in her eyes.
Thank you very much for saying so, I replied. I like to think of you
as an _old_ friend, (though you dont look it! would have been the
almost necessary sequence, with any other lady; but she and I seemed to
have long passed out of the time when compliments, or any such
trivialities, were possible.)
Here the train paused at a station, where two or three passengers
entered the carriage; so no more was said till we had reached our
journeys end.
On our arrival at Elveston, she readily adopted my suggestion that we
should walk up together; so, as soon as our luggage had been duly taken
charge ofhers by the servant who met her at the station, and mine by
one of the porterswe set out together along the familiar lanes, now
linked in my memory with so many delightful associations. Lady Muriel at
once recommenced the conversation at the point where it had been
interrupted.
You knew of my engagement to my cousin Eric. Did you also hear
Yes, I interrupted, anxious to spare her the pain of giving any
details. I heard it had all come to an end.
I would like to tell you how it happened, she said; as that is the
very point I want your advice about. I had long realised that we were
not in sympathy in religious belief. His ideas of Christianity are very
shadowy; and even as to the existence of a God he lives in a sort of
dreamland. But it has not affected his life! I feel sure, now, that the
most absolute Atheist _may_ be leading, though walking blindfold, a pure
and noble life. And if you knew half the good deeds she broke off
suddenly, and turned away her head.
I entirely agree with you, I said. And have we not our Saviours own
promise that such a life shall surely lead to the light?
Yes, I know it, she said in a broken voice, still keeping her head
turned away. And so I told him. He said he would believe, for _my_
sake, if he could. And he wished, for _my_ sake, he could see things as
I did. But that is all wrong! she went on passionately. God _cannot_
approve such low motives as that! Still it was not _I_ that broke it
off. I knew he loved me; and I had _promised_; and
Then it was _he_ that broke it off?
He released me unconditionally. She faced me again now, having quite
recovered her usual calmness of manner.
Then what difficulty remains?
It is _this_, that I dont believe he did it of his own free will. Now,
supposing he did it _against_ his will, merely to satisfy my scruples,
would not his claim on me remain just as strong as ever? And would not
my promise be as binding as ever? My father says no; but I cant help
fearing he is biased by his love for me. And Ive asked no one else. I
have many friendsfriends for the bright sunny weather; not friends for
the clouds and storms of life; not _old_ friends like you!
