RITA. [Half playfully, half angrily, slaps his hand.] Oh, I do wish you
would stop talking like that.
ALLMERS. I speak of it only as a sort of introduction.
RITA. Then do skip the introduction!
ALLMERS. Rita,--you must not think it was the doctor's advice that drove
me up to the mountains.
ASTA. Was it not, Alfred?
RITA. What was it, then?
ALLMERS. It was this: I found there was no more peace for me, there in
my study.
RITA. No peace! Why, who disturbed you?
ALLMERS. [Shaking his head.] No one from without. But I felt as though
I were positively abusing--or, say rather, wasting--my best
powers--frittering away the time.
ASTA. [With wide eyes.] When you were writing at your book?
ALLMERS. [Nodding.] For I cannot think that my powers are confined to
that alone. I must surely have it in me to do one or two other things as
well.
RITA. Was that what you sat there brooding over?
ALLMERS. Yes, mainly that.
RITA. And so that is what has made you so discontented with yourself
of late; and with the rest of us as well. For you know you were
discontented, Alfred.
ALLMERS. [Gazing straight before him.] There I sat bent over my table,
day after day, and often half the night too--writing and writing at the
great thick book on "Human Responsibility." H'm!
ASTA. [Laying her hand upon his arm.] But, Alfred--that book is to be
your life-work.
RITA. Yes, you have said so often enough.
ALLMERS. I thought so. Ever since I grew up, I have thought so. [With an
affectionate expression in his eyes.] And it was you that enabled me to
devote myself to it, my dear Rita--
RITA. Oh, nonsense!
ALLMERS. [Smiling to her.]--you, with your gold, and your green
forests--
RITA. [Half laughing, half vexed.] If you begin all that rubbish again,
I shall beat you.
ASTA. [Looking sorrowfully at him.] But the book, Alfred?
ALLMERS. It began, as it were, to drift away from me. But I was more and
more beset by the thought of the higher duties that laid their claims
upon me.
RITA. [Beaming, seizes his hand.] Alfred!
ALLMERS. The thought of Eyolf, my dear Rita.
RITA. [Disappointed, drops his hand.] Ah--of Eyolf!
ALLMERS. Poor little Eyolf has taken deeper and deeper hold of me. After
that unlucky fall from the table--and especially since we have been
assured that the injury is incurable--
RITA. [Insistently.] But you take all the care you possibly can of him,
Alfred!
ALLMERS. As a schoolmaster, yes; but not as a father. And it is a father
that I want henceforth to be to Eyolf.
RITA. [Looking at him and shaking her head.] I don't think I quite
understand you.
ALLMERS. I mean that I will try with all my might to make his misfortune
as painless and easy to him as it can possibly be.
RITA. Oh, but, dear--thank Heaven, I don't think he feels it so deeply.
ASTA. [With emotion.] Yes, Rita, he does.
