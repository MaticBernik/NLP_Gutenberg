(_Chalmers and Hubbard make exit to right._) (_Margaret puts her
arm impulsively around Connie--a sheerly spontaneous act of
affection--kisses her, and at same time evinces preparation to
leave._)
{Margaret}
I've got to get my things off. Won't you wait here, dear, in case
anybody comes? It's nearly time.
(_Starts toward exit to rear, but is stopped by Connie._) Madge.
(_Margaret immediately pauses and waits expectantly, smiling,
while Connie is hesitant._)
I want to speak to you about something, Madge. You don't mind?
(_Margaret, still smiling, shakes her head._) Just a warning. Not
that anybody could believe for a moment, there is anything wrong,
but----
{Margaret}
(_Dispelling a shadow of irritation that has crossed her face._)
If it concerns Tom, don't tell me, please. You know he does do
ridiculous things at times. But I don't let him worry me any
more; so don't worry me about him.
(_Connie remains silent, and Margaret grows curious._) Well?
{Connie}
It's not about Tom--
(_Pauses._) It's about you.
{Margaret}
Oh.
{Connie}
I don't know how to begin.
{Margaret}
By coming right out with it, the worst of it, all at once, first.
{Connie}
It isn't serious at all, but--well, mother is worrying about
it. You know how old-fashioned she is. And when you consider our
position--father's and Tom's, I mean--it doesn't seem just right
for you to be seeing so much of such an enemy of theirs. He
has abused them dreadfully, you know. And there's that dreadful
speech he is going to give to-morrow. You haven't seen the
afternoon papers. He has made the most terrible charges against
everybody--all of us, our friends, everybody.
{Margaret}
You mean Mr. Knox, of course. But he wouldn't harm anybody,
Connie, dear.
{Connie}
(_Bridling,_) Oh, he wouldn't? He as good as publicly called father
a thief.
{Margaret}
When did that happen? I never heard of it.
{Connie}
Well, he said that the money magnates had grown so unprincipled,
sunk so low, that they would steal a mouse from a blind kitten.
{Margaret}
I don't see what father has to do with that.
{Connie}
He meant him just the same.
{Margaret}
You silly goose. He couldn't have meant father. Father? Why,
father wouldn't look at anything less than fifty or a hundred
millions.
{Connie}
And you speak to him and make much of him when you meet him
places. You talked with him for half an hour at that Dugdale
reception. You have him here in your own house--Tom's house--when
he's such a bitter enemy of Tom's. (_During the foregoing speech,
Anthony Starkweather makes entrance from rear. His face is grave,
and he is in a brown study, as if pondering weighty problems.
At sight of the two women he pauses and surveys them. They are
unaware of his presence._)
{Margaret}
You are wrong, Connie. He is nobody's enemy. He is the truest,
cleanest, most right-seeking man I have ever seen.
{Connie}
(_Interrupting._) He is a trouble-maker, a disturber of the public
peace, a shallow-pated demagogue--
{Margaret}
(_Reprovingly._)
