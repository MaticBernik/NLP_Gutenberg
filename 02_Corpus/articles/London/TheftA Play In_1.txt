{Mrs. Starkweather}
(_Starting forward in her chair and listening intently._) There's
Tommy, now.
(_Voices of Margaret Chalmers and of Tommy heard from without.
Hers is laughingly protesting, while Tommy's is gleefully
insistent._) (_Margaret and Tommy appear and pause just outside
door, holding each other's hands, facing each other, too immersed
in each other to be aware of the presence of those inside the
room. Margaret and Tommy are in street costume._)
{Tommy} (_Laughing._)
But mama.
{Margaret}
(_Herself laughing, but shaking her head._) No. Tommy First--
{Margaret}
No; you must run along to Linda, now, mother's boy. And we'll
talk about that some other time.
(_Tommy notices for the first time that there are persons in the
room. He peeps in around the door and espies Mrs. Starkweather.
At the same moment, impulsively, he withdraws his hands and runs
in to Mrs. Starkweather._)
{Tommy}
(_Who is evidently fond of his grandmother._) Grandma!
(_They embrace and make much of each other._)
(_Margaret enters, appropriately greeting the others--a kiss
(_maybe_) to Connie, and a slightly cold handshake to Hubbard._)
{Margaret}
(_To Chalmers._) Now that you're here, Tom, you mustn't run away.
(_Greets Mrs. Starkweather._)
{Mrs. Starkweather}
(_Turning Tommy's face to the light and looking at it anxiously._)
A trifle thin, Margaret.
{Margaret}
On the contrary, mother----
{Mrs. Starkweather}
(_To Chalmers._) Don't you think so, Tom?
{Connie}
(_Aside to Hubbard._) Mother continually worries about his health.
{Hubbard}
A sturdy youngster, I should say.
{Tommy}
(_To Chalmers._) I'm an Indian, aren't I, daddy?
{Chalmers}
(_Nodding his head emphatically._) And the stoutest-hearted in the
tribe.
(_Linda appears in doorway, evidently looking for Tommy, and
Chalmers notices her._) There's Linda looking for you, young stout
heart.
{Margaret}
Take Tommy, Linda. Run along, mother's boy.
{Tommy}
Come along, grandma. I want to show you something.
(_He catches Mrs. Starkweather by the hand. Protesting, but highly
pleased, she allows him to lead her to the door, where he extends
his other hand to Linda. Thus, pausing in doorway, leading a
woman by either hand, he looks back at Margaret._) (_Roguishly._)
Remember, mama, we're going to scout in a little while.
{Margaret}
(_Going to Tommy, and bending down with her arms around him._)
No, Tommy. Mama has to go to that horrid dinner to-night. But
to-morrow we'll play.
(_Tommy is cast down and looks as if he might pout._) Where is my
little Indian now?
{Hubbard}
Be an Indian, Tommy.
{Tommy}
(_Brightening up._)
All right, mama. To-morrow.----if you can't find time to-day.
(_Margaret kisses him._) (_Exit Tommy, Mrs. Starkweather, and Linda,
Tommy leading them by a hand in each of theirs._)
{Chalmers}
(_Nodding to Hubbard, in low voice to Hubbard and starting to make
exit to right._) That high-ball.
(_Hubbard disengages himself from proximity of Connie, and starts
to follow._)
{Connie}
(_Reproachfully._) If you run away, I won't stop for tea.
{Margaret}
Do stop, Tom. Father will be here in a few minutes.
{Connie}
A regular family party.
{Chalmers}
All right. We'll be back. We're just going to have a little talk.
