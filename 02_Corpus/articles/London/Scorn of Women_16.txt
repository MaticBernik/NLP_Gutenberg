PRINCE
It's not my fault. It's the women, I tell you. They're running the
show.
MAN
_(Wheedlingly.)_
You might let a fellow in just for a peep. Nobody'll know. I'll clear
out before they unmask.
PRINCE
_(Pleadingly.)_
I can't really, old man, I--
_(Catches sight oj Mrs. McFee, who appears in doorway to left.)_
Look at her! Get out quick!
_(Places hand on his shoulder in friendly way and starts to shove him
out.)_
MAN
_(Catching sight of Mrs. McFee.)_
Wow!
_(With bodily expression of fear, shrinks behind Prince and allows
himself to be shoved out.)_
MRS. McFEE
_(Crossing over to Prince, and suspiciously.)_ Who might that body be?
PRINCE
_(Wiping his brow.)_
One of the unelect, I am sorry to say, Mrs. McFee.
MRS. McFEE
A gambler man, I take it?
_(Prince nods.)_
But I can no see, Mr. Prince, why you should conduct negotiations
inside the door, contameenating the air with the bodily presence of
the children of sin.
PRINCE
_(Slight note of anger in his voice.)_
Do you know how cold it is, Mrs. McFee?
MRS. MCFEE
I have no given it a thought.
PRINCE
Well, it's seventy degrees below zero, and still going down. If that
door is open one minute, a refrigerator would be comfortable alongside
that ballroom. And if you don't like the way I'm doing things--
_(A knock is heard, and he opens door. Sitka Charley squeezes in.)_
PRINCE
_(Very politely.)_
Can Sitka Charley come in, Mrs. McFee?
MRS. McFEE
_(Turning to go.)_
He is a good body. There is no reason why he should not bide a wee.
_(To Sitka Charley.)_
But you must go right away again, Charley.
SITKA CHARLEY
_(Nods his head, and then to Prince.)_ Where um Vanderlip?
PRINCE
He's here somewhere. Go and find him.
_(Laughter and voices, and many couples enter from lejt, some in
costume, several in hooded dominos.)_
SITKA CHARLEY
_(Recoiling, startled and excited.)_
What that?
_(Prince laughs.)_
What for? Everybody crazy?
PRINCE
_(Laughing.)_
Button, button, who's got the button. Go and find him.
_(Sitka Charley, walking stealthily, like a wild animal in dangerous
territory, goes adventuring amongst the maskers.)_ _(After some time,
a domino takes Sitka Charley by the arm and leads him apart.)_
SITKA CHARLEY
_(Dragging back and struggling to escape.)_ What for, crazymans?
VANDERLIP
Shut up! It's me, Vanderlip. Looking for me?
SITKA CHARLEY
_(With relief.)_
Um.
VANDERLIP
Anything wrong?
SITKA CHARLEY
_(Shaking head.)_
No wrong. All right. Um Freda want you come right away.
VANDERLIP
_(Surprised.)_
Freda! What's she want with me?
SITKA CHARLEY
Um no tell. Um say: "Charley, you go Pioneer Hall quick. All the same
one big dance. You catch um Vanderlip. You make um come right away."
VANDERLIP
_(Puzzled.)_
Where?
SITKA CHARLEY
Um Freda's cabin. You come now?
VANDERLIP
_(Thinks for a minute, with a bothered air.)_ I'll come in a little
while. You tell her.
_(Turns to rejoin dancers, and speaks over shoulder.)_
Dogs all right?
SITKA CHARLEY
Um.
VANDERLIP
Be at the water-hole at twelve o'clock?
