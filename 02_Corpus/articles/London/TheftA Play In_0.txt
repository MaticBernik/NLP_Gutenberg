(_Chalmers, who throughout this speech is showing a growing
resentment, is about to speak, when voices are heard without and
he checks himself._)
(_Enter. Mrs. Starkweather, rather flustered and imminently in
danger of a collapse, followed by Connie Starkweather, fresh,
radiant, and joyous._)
{Mrs. Starkweather}
(_With appeal and relief._)
Oh----Tom!
(_Chalmers takes her hand sympathetically and protectingly._)
{Connie}
(_Who is an exuberant young woman, bursts forth._) Oh,
brother-in-law! Such excitement! That's what's the matter with
mother. We ran into a go-cart. Our chauffeur was not to blame. It
was the woman's fault. She tried to cross just as we were turning
the corner. But we hardly grazed it. Fortunately the baby was
not hurt--only spilled. It was ridiculous. (_Catching sight of
Hubbard._) Oh, there you are, Mr. Hubbard. How de do.
(_Steps half way to meet him and shakes hands with him._) (_Mrs.
Starkweather looks around helplessly for a chair, and Chalmers
conducts her to one soothingly._)
{Mrs. Starkweather}
Oh, it was terrible! The little child might have been killed. And
such persons love their babies, I know.
{Connie}
(_To Chalmers._) Has father come? We were to pick him up here.
Where's Madge?
{Mrs. Starkweather}
(_Espying Hubbard, faintly._) Oh, there is Mr. Hubbard.
(_Hubbard comes to her and shakes hands._) I simply can't get
used to these rapid ways of modern life. The motor-car is the
invention of the devil. Everything is _too_ quick. When I was
a girl, we lived sedately, decorously. There was time for
meditation and repose. But in this age there is time for nothing.
How Anthony keeps his head is more than I can understand. But,
then, Anthony is a wonderful man.
{Hubbard}
I am sure Mr. Starkweather never lost his head in his life.
{Chalmers}
Unless when he was courting you, mother.
{Mrs. Starkweather}
(_A trifle grimly._) I'm not so sure about that.
{Connie}
(_Imitating a grave, business-like enunciation._) Father probably
conferred first with his associates, then turned the affair over
for consideration by his corporation lawyers, and, when they
reported no flaws, checked the first spare half hour in his
notebook to ask mother if she would have him.
(_They laugh._) And looked at his watch at least twice while he was
proposing.
{Mrs. Starkweather}
Anthony was not so busy then as all that.
{Hubbard}
He hadn't yet taken up the job of running the United States.
{Mrs. Starkweather}
I'm sure I don't know what he is running, but he is a very busy
man--business, politics, and madness; madness, politics, and
business.
(_She stops breathlessly and glances at tea-table._) Tea. I should
like a cup of tea. Connie, I shall stay for a cup of tea, and
then, if your father hasn't come, we'll go home. (_To Chalmers._)
Where is Tommy?
{Chalmers}
Out in the car with Madge.
(_Glances at tea-table and consults watch._) She should be back
now.
{Connie}
Mother, you mustn't stay long. I have to dress.
{Chalmers}
Oh, yes, that dinner.
(_Yawns._) I wish I could loaf to-night.
{Connie}
(_Explaining to Hubbard._) The Turkish Charge d'Affaires--I never
can remember his name. But he's great fun--a positive joy. He's
giving the dinner to the British Ambassador.
