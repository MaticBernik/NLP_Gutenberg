If we was glad to meet them, you may be sure they were glad to meet with
us, and so we began to sort together as one Company, only they were loth to
give over and return, as we were and which we had now resolv'd on.
We were so rich ourselves, and so fully satisfy'd with what we had taken,
that we began to be bountiful to our Countrymen; and indeed they dealt so
generously with us, that we could not but be inclin'd to do them some Good,
for when we talk'd of buying their Gunpowder, they very frankly gave us 50
Jarrs of it _gratis_.
I took this so kindly, that I call'd a little Council among ourselves, and
propos'd to send the poor Rogues 50 Barrels of our Beef, which we could
very well spare; and our Company agreeing to it, we did so, which made
their Hearts glad; for it was very good, and they had not tasted good
Salt-beef for a long Time; and with it we sent them two Hogsheads of Rum:
This made them so hearty to us, that they sent two of their Company to
compliment us, to offer to enter themselves on Board us, and to go with us
all the World over.
We did not so readily agree to this at first, because we had no new
Enterprize in View; but however, as they sent us Word they had chosen me so
unanimously for their Captain, I propos'd to our Men to remove ourselves,
and all our Goods, into the great Ship and the Sloop, and so take the
honest Fellows into the Fregat, which now had no less than 22 Guns, and
would hold them all, and then they might sail with us, or go upon any
Adventures of their own, as we should agree.
Accordingly we did so, and gave them that Ship, with all her Guns and
Ammunition, but made one of our own Men Captain, which they consented to,
and so we became all one Body.
Here also we shar'd our Booty, which was great indeed to a Profusion; and
as keeping such a Treasure in every Man's particular private Possession,
would have occasion'd Gaming, Quarrelling, and perhaps Thieving and
Pilfering, I order'd that so many small Chests should be made as there were
Men in the Ship, and every Man's Treasure was nail'd up in these Chests,
and the Chests all stow'd in the Hold, with every Man's Name upon his
Chest, not to be touch'd but by general Order, and to prevent Gaming, I
prevail'd with them to make a Law or Agreement, and everyone to set their
Hands to it; by which they agreed, That if any Man play'd for any more
Money than he had in his Keeping, the Winner should not be paid whatever
the Loser run in Debt, but the Chest containing every Man's Dividend,
should be all his own, to be deliver'd whole to him; and the Offender,
whenever he left the Ship, if he would pay any Gaming Debts afterward, that
was another Case; but such Debts should never be paid while he continu'd in
that Company.
