(_Mrs. Starkweather crosses to table, greets others
characteristically and is served with tea by Connie._)
(_Chalmers waits respectfully on Starkweather._)
{Starkweather}
(_Looking up from note-book._) That will do, Tom.
(_Chalmers is just starting across to join others, when voices are
heard outside rear entrance, and Margaret enters with Dolores
Ortega, wife of the Peruvian Minister, and Matsu Sakari,
Secretary of Japanese Legation--both of whom she has met as they
were entering the house._)
(_Chalmers changes his course, and meets the above advancing
group. He knows Dolores Ortega, whom he greets, and is introduced
to Sakari._)
(_Margaret passes on among guests, greeting them, etc. Then she
displaces Connie at tea-table and proceeds to dispense tea to the
newcomers._)
(_Groups slowly form and seat themselves about stage as follows:
Chalmers and Dolores Ortega; Rutland, Dowsett, Mrs. Starkweather;
Connie, Mr. Dowsett, and Hubbard._)
(_Chalmers carries tea to Dolores Ortega._)
(_Sakari has been lingering by table, waiting for tea and
pattering with Margaret, Chalmers, etc._)
{Margaret}
(_Handing cup to Sakari._) I am very timid in offering you this,
for I am sure you must be appalled by our barbarous methods of
making tea.
{Sakari}
(_Bowing._) It is true, your American tea, and the tea of the
English, are quite radically different from the tea in my
country. But one learns, you know. I served my apprenticeship
to American tea long years ago, when I was at Yale. It was
perplexing, I assure you--at first, only at first I really
believe that I am beginning to have a--how shall I call it?--a
tolerance for tea in your fashion.
{Margaret}
You are very kind in overlooking our shortcomings.
{Sakari}
(_Bowing._) On the contrary, I am unaware, always unaware, of any
shortcomings of this marvelous country of yours.
{Margaret}
(_Laughing._) You are incorrigibly gracious, Mr. Sakari. (_Knox
appears at threshold of rear entrance and pauses irresolutely for
a moment_)
{Sakari}
(_Noticing Knox, and looking about him to select which group he
will join._) If I may be allowed, I shall now retire and consume
this--tea.
(_Joins group composed of Connie, Mrs. Dowsett, and Hubbard._)
(_Knox comes forward to Margaret, betraying a certain awkwardness
due to lack of experience in such social functions. He greets
Margaret and those in the group nearest her._)
{Knox}
(_To Margaret._) I don't know why I come here. I do not belong. All
the ways are strange.
{Margaret}
(_Lightly, at the same time preparing his tea._) The same Ali
Baba--once again in the den of the forty thieves. But your watch
and pocket-book are safe here, really they are.
(_Knox makes a gesture of dissent at her facetiousness._) Now don't
be serious. You should relax sometimes. You live too tensely.
(_Looking at Starkweather._) There's the arch-anarch over there,
the dragon you are trying to slay.
(_Knox looks at Starkweather and is plainly perplexed._) The man
who handles all the life insurance funds, who controls more
strings of banks and trust companies than all the Rothschilds
a hundred times over--the merger of iron and steel and coal and
shipping and all the other things--the man who blocks your child
labor bill and all the rest of the remedial legislation you
advocate. In short, my father.
