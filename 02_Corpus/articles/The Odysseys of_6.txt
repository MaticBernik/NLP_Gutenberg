<U+202D>  THE SIXTH BOOK OF HOMERS ODYSSEYS
<U+202D>  THE ARGUMENT
<U+202D>  Minerva in a vision stands
<U+202D>  Before Nausicaa:  and commands
<U+202D>  She to the flood her weeds should bear;
<U+202D>  For now her nuptial day was near.
<U+202D>  Nausicaa her charge obeys,
<U+202D>  And then with other virgins plays.
<U+202D>  Their sports make wakd Ulysses rise;
<U+202D>  Walk to them, and beseech supplies
<U+202D>  Of food and clothes.  His naked sight
<U+202D>  Puts th other maids, afraid, to flight;
<U+202D>  Nausicaa only boldly stays,
<U+202D>  And gladly his desire obeys.
<U+202D>  He, furnishd with her favours shown,
<U+202D>  Attends her and the rest to town.
<U+202D>  _<U+0396><U+03B7><U+0311><U+03C4><U+03B1>._
<U+202D>     Here olive leaves
<U+202D>        T hide shame began,
<U+202D>     The maid receives
<U+202D>        The naked man.
<U+202D>  The much-sustaining, patient, heavnly man,
<U+202D>  Whom Toil and Sleep had worn so weak and wan,  [1]
<U+202D>  Thus won his rest.  In mean space Pallas went
<U+202D>  To the Phaacian city, and descent
<U+202D>  That first did broad Hyperias lands divide,
<U+202D>  Near the vast Cyclops, men of monstrous pride,
<U+202D>  That preyd on those Hyperians, since they were
<U+202D>  Of greater powr; and therefore longer there
<U+202D>  Divine Nausithous dwelt not, but arose,
<U+202D>  And did for Scheria all his powrs dispose;
<U+202D>  Far from ingenious art-inventing men
<U+202D>  But there did he erect a city then,
<U+202D>  First drew a wall round, then he houses builds,
<U+202D>  And then a temple to the Gods, the fields
<U+202D>  Lastly dividing.  But he, stoopd by Fate,
<U+202D>  Divd to th infernals; and Alcinous sate
<U+202D>  In his command, a man the Gods did teach
<U+202D>  Commanding counsels.  His house held the reach
<U+202D>  Of grey Minervas project, to provide
<U+202D>  That great-sould Ithacus might be supplied
<U+202D>  With all things fitting his return.  She went
<U+202D>  Up to the chamber, where the fair descent
<U+202D>  Of great Alcinous slept; a maid, whose parts
<U+202D>  In wit and beauty wore divine deserts.
<U+202D>  Well-deckd her chamber was; of which the door
<U+202D>  Did seem to lighten, such a gloss it bore
<U+202D>  Betwixt the posts, and now flew ope to find
<U+202D>  The Goddess entry.  Like a puft of wind
<U+202D>  She reachd the virgin bed; neat which there lay
<U+202D>  Two maids, to whom the Graces did convey
<U+202D>  Figure and manners.  But above the head
<U+202D>  Of bright Nausicaa did Pallas tread
<U+202D>  The subtle air, and put the person on
<U+202D>  Of Dymas daughter, from comparison
<U+202D>  Exempt in business naval.  Like his seed
<U+202D>  Minerva lookd now; whom one year did breed  [2]
<U+202D>  With bright Nausicaa, and who had gaind
<U+202D>  Grace in her love, yet on her thus complaind:
<U+202D>     Nausicaa!  Why bred thy mother one
<U+202D>  So negligent in rites so stood upon
<U+202D>  By other virgins?  Thy fair garments lie
<U+202D>  Neglected by thee, yet thy nuptials nigh;
<U+202D>  When rich in all attire both thou shouldst be,
<U+202D>  And garments give to others honouring thee,
<U+202D>  That lead thee to the temple.  Thy good name
<U+202D>  Grows amongst men for these things; they inflame
<U+202D>  Father and revrend mother with delight.
<U+202D>  Come, when the Day takes any wink from Night,
<U+202D>  Lets to the river, and repurify
<U+202D>  Thy wedding garments.  My society
<U+202D>  Shall freely serve thee for thy speedier aid,
<U+202D>  Because thou shalt no mote stand on the maid.
<U+202D>  The best of all Phaacia woo thy grace,
<U+202D>  Where thou wert bred, and owst thyself a race.
<U+202D>  Up, and stir up to thee thy honourd sire,
<U+202D>  To give thee mules and coach, thee and thy tire,
<U+202D>  Veils, girdles, mantles, early to the flood
<U+202D>  To bear in state.  It suits thy high-born blood,
<U+202D>  And far more fits thee, than to foot so far,
<U+202D>  For far from town thou knowst the bath-founts are.
<U+202D>     This said, away blue-eyed Minerva went
<U+202D>  Up to Olympus, the firm continent
<U+202D>  That bears in endless being the Deified kind,
<U+202D>  Thats neither sousd with showrs, nor shook with wind,
<U+202D>  Nor chilld with snow, but where Serenity flies
<U+202D>  Exempt from clouds, and ever-beamy skies
<U+202D>  Circle the glittring hill, and all their days
<U+202D>  Give the delights of blesséd Deity praise.
<U+202D>  And hither Pallas flew, and left the maid,
<U+202D>  When she had all that might excite her said.
<U+202D>  Straight rose the lovely Morn, that up did raise
<U+202D>  Fair-veild Nausicaa, whose dream her praise
<U+202D>  To admiration took; who no time spent
<U+202D>  To give the rapture of her vision vent
<U+202D>  To her lovd parents, whom she found within.
<U+202D>  Her mother set at fire, who had to spin
<U+202D>  A rock, whose tincture with sea-purple shind;
<U+202D>  Her maids about her.  But she chancd to find
<U+202D>  Her father going abroad, to council calld
<U+202D>  By his grave Senate.  And to him exhald
<U+202D>  Her smotherd bosom was:  Lovd sire,  said she,  [3]
<U+202D>  Will you not now command a coach for me,
<U+202D>  Stately and cómplete, fit for me to bear
<U+202D>  To wash at flood the weeds I cannot wear
<U+202D>  Before repurified?  Yourself it fits
<U+202D>  To wear fair weeds, as evry man that sits
<U+202D>  In place of council.  And five sons you have,
<U+202D>  Two wed, three bachelors, that must be brave
<U+202D>  In evry days shift, that they may go dance;
<U+202D>  For these three last with these things must advance
<U+202D>  Their states in marriage, and who else but I,
<U+202D>  Their sister, should their dancing rites supply?
<U+202D>     This genral cause she showd, and would not name
<U+202D>  Her mind of nuptials to her sire, for shame.
<U+202D>  He understood her yet, and thus replied:
<U+202D>  Daughter!  nor these, nor any grace beside,
<U+202D>  I either will deny thee, or defer,
<U+202D>  Mules, nor a coach, of state and circular,
<U+202D>  Fitting at all parts.  Go, my servants shall
<U+202D>  Serves thy desires, and thy command in all.
<U+202D>     The servants then commanded soon obeyd,
<U+202D>  Fetchd coach, and mules joind in it.  Then the Maid
<U+202D>  Brought from the chamber her rich weeds, and laid
<U+202D>  All up in coach; in which her mother placd
<U+202D>  A maund of victuals, varied well in taste,
<U+202D>  And other junkets.  Wine she likewise filld
<U+202D>  Within a goat-skin bottle, and distilld
<U+202D>  Sweet and moist oil into a golden cruse,
<U+202D>  Both for her daughters, and her handmaids, use,
<U+202D>  To soften their bright bodies, when they rose
<U+202D>  Cleansd from their cold baths.  Up to coach then goes
<U+202D>  Th observéd Maid, takes both the scourge and reins,
<U+202D>  And to her side her handmaid straight attains.
<U+202D>  Nor these alone, but other virgins, gracd
<U+202D>  The nuptial chariot.  The whole bevy placd,
<U+202D>  Nausicaa scourgd to make the coach-mules run,
<U+202D>  That neighd, and pacd their usual speed, and soon
<U+202D>  Both maids and weeds brought to the river-side,
<U+202D>  Where baths for all the year their use supplied,
<U+202D>  Whose waters were so pure they would not stain,
<U+202D>  But still ran fair forth, and did more remain
<U+202D>  Apt to purge stains, for that purgd stain within,
<U+202D>  Which by the waters pure store was not seen.
<U+202D>     These, here arrivd, the mules uncoachd, and drave
<U+202D>  Up to the gulfy rivers shore, that gave
<U+202D>  Sweet grass to them.  The maids from coach then took
<U+202D>  Their clothes, and steepd them in the sable brook:
<U+202D>  Then put them into springs, and trod them clean
<U+202D>  With cleanly feet; adventuring wagers then
<U+202D>  Who should have soonest and most cleanly done.
<U+202D>  When having thoroughly cleansd, they spread them on
<U+202D>  The floods shore, all in order.  And then, where
<U+202D>  The waves the pebbles washd, and ground was clear,
<U+202D>  They bathd themselves, and all with glittring oil
<U+202D>  Smoothd their white skins; refreshing then their toil
<U+202D>  With pleasant dinner, by the river-side;
<U+202D>  Yet still watchd when the sun their clothes had dried.
<U+202D>  Till which time, having dind, Nausicaa
<U+202D>  With other virgins did at stool-ball play,
<U+202D>  Their shoulder-reaching head-tires laying by.
<U+202D>  Nausicaa, with the wrists of ivory,
<U+202D>  The liking stroke struck, singing first a song,
<U+202D>  As custom orderd, and amidst the throng
<U+202D>  Made such a show, and so past all was seen,
<U+202D>  As when the chaste-born, arrow-loving, Queen,
<U+202D>  Along the mountains gliding, either over
<U+202D>  Spartan Taygetus, whose tops far discover,
<U+202D>  Or Eurymanthus, in the wild boars chace,
<U+202D>  Or swift-hovd hart, and with her Joves fair race,
<U+202D>  The field Nymphs, sporting; amongst whom, to see
<U+202D>  How far Diana had priority,
<U+202D>  Though all were fair, for fairness yet of all,
<U+202D>  As both by head and forehead being more tall,
<U+202D>  Latona triumphd, since the dullest sight
<U+202D>  Might easly judge whom her pains brought to light;
<U+202D>  Nausicaa so, whom never husband tamd,
<U+202D>  Above them all in all the beauties flamd.
<U+202D>  But when they now made homewards, and arrayd,
<U+202D>  Ordring their weeds disorderd as they playd,
<U+202D>  Mules and coach ready, then Minerva thought
<U+202D>  What means to wake Ulysses might be wrought,
<U+202D>  That he might see this lovely-sighted maid,
<U+202D>  Whom she intended should become his aid,
<U+202D>  Bring him to town, and his return advance.
<U+202D>  Her mean was this, though thought a stool-ball chance:  [4]
<U+202D>  The queen now, for the upstroke, struck the ball
<U+202D>  Quite wide off th other maids, and made it fall
<U+202D>  Amidst the whirlpools.  At which out shriekd all,
<U+202D>  And with the shriek did wise Ulysses wake;
<U+202D>  Who, sitting up, was doubtful who should make
<U+202D>  That sudden outcry, and in mind thus strivd:
<U+202D>  On what a people am I now arrivd?
<U+202D>  At civil hospitable men, that fear
<U+202D>  The Gods?  Or dwell injurious mortals here?
<U+202D>  Unjust, and churlish?  Like the female cry
<U+202D>  Of youth it sounds.  What are they?  Nymphs bred high
<U+202D>  On tops of hills, or in the founts of floods,
<U+202D>  In herby marshes, or in leafy woods?
<U+202D>  Or are they high-spoke men I now am near?
<U+202D>  Ill prove, and see.  With this, the wary peer
<U+202D>  Crept forth the thicket, and an olive bough
<U+202D>  Broke with his broad hand, which he did bestow
<U+202D>  In covert of his nakedness, and then
<U+202D>  Put hasty head out.  Look how from his den
<U+202D>  A mountain lion looks, that, all embrued
<U+202D>  With drops of trees, and weather-beaten-hued,
<U+202D>  Bold of his strength, goes on, and in his eye
<U+202D>  A burning furnace glows, all bent to prey
<U+202D>  On sheep, or oxen, or the upland hart,
<U+202D>  His belly charging him, and he must part
<U+202D>  Stakes with the herdsman in his beasts attempt,
<U+202D>  Evn where from rape their strengths are most exempt;
<U+202D>  So wet, so weather-beat, so stung with need,
<U+202D>  Evn to the home-fields of the countrys breed
<U+202D>  Ulysses was to force forth his access,
<U+202D>  Though merely naked; and his sight did press
<U+202D>  The eyes of soft-haird virgins.  Horrid was
<U+202D>  His rough appearance to them; the hard pass
<U+202D>  He had at sea stuck by him.  All in flight
<U+202D>  The virgins scatterd, frighted with this sight,
<U+202D>  About the prominent windings of the flood.
<U+202D>  All but Nausicaa fled; but she fast stood,
<U+202D>  Pallas had put a boldness in her breast,
<U+202D>  And in her fair limbs tender fear comprest.
<U+202D>  And still she stood him, as resolvd to know
<U+202D>  What man he was, or out of what should grow
<U+202D>  His strange repair to them.  And here was he
<U+202D>  Put to his wisdom; if her virgin knee
<U+202D>  He should be bold, but kneeling, to embrace,
<U+202D>  Or keep aloof, and try with words of grace,
<U+202D>  In humblest suppliance, if he might obtain
<U+202D>  Some cover for his nakedness, and gain
<U+202D>  Her grace to show and guide him to the town.
<U+202D>  The last he best thought, to be worth his own,
<U+202D>  In weighing both well; to keep still aloof,
<U+202D>  And give with soft words his desires their proof,
<U+202D>  Lest, pressing so near as to touch her knee,
<U+202D>  He might incense her maiden modesty.
<U+202D>  This fair and fild speech then shewd this was he:
<U+202D>     Let me beseech, O queen, this truth of thee,
<U+202D>  Are you of mortal, or the defied, race?
<U+202D>  If of the Gods, that th ample heavns embrace,
<U+202D>  I can resemble you to none above
<U+202D>  So near as to the chaste-born birth of Jove,
<U+202D>  The beamy Cynthia.  Her you full present,
<U+202D>  In grace of evry God-like lineament,
<U+202D>  Her goodly magnitude, and all th address
<U+202D>  You promise of her very perfectness.
<U+202D>  If sprung of humans, that inhabit earth,
<U+202D>  Thrice blest are both the authors of your birth,
<U+202D>  Thrice blest your brothers, that in your deserts
<U+202D>  Must, evn to rapture, bear delighted hearts,
<U+202D>  To see, so like the first trim of a tree,
<U+202D>  Your form adorn a dance.  But most blest he,
<U+202D>  Of all that breathe, that hath the gift t engage
<U+202D>  Your bright neck in the yoke of marriage,
<U+202D>  And deck his house with your commanding merit
<U+202D>  I have not seen a man of so much spirit,
<U+202D>  Nor man, nor woman, I did ever see,
<U+202D>  At all parts equal to the parts in thee.
<U+202D>  T enjoy your sight, doth admiration seize
<U+202D>  My eyes, and apprehensive faculties.
<U+202D>  Lately in Delos (with a charge of men
<U+202D>  Arrivd, that renderd me most wretched then,
<U+202D>  Now making me thus naked) I beheld
<U+202D>  The burthen of a palm, whose issue swelld
<U+202D>  About Apollos fane, and that put on
<U+202D>  A grace like thee; for Earth had never none
<U+202D>  Of all her sylvan issue so adornd.
<U+202D>  Into amaze my very soul was turnd,
<U+202D>  To give it observation; as now thee
<U+202D>  To view, O virgin, a stupidity
<U+202D>  Past admiration strikes me, joind with fear
<U+202D>  To do a suppliants due, and press so near,
<U+202D>  As to embrace thy knees.  Nor is it strange,
<U+202D>  For one of fresh and firmest spirit would change
<U+202D>  T embrace so bright an object.  But, for me,
<U+202D>  A cruel habit of calamity
<U+202D>  Prepard the strong impression thou hast made;
<U+202D>  For this last day did fly nights twentieth shade
<U+202D>  Since I, at length, escapd the sable seas;
<U+202D>  When in the mean time th unrelenting prease
<U+202D>  Of waves and stern storms tossd me up and down,
<U+202D>  From th isle Ogygia.  And now God hath thrown
<U+202D>  My wrack on this shore, that perhaps I may
<U+202D>  My misries vary here; for yet their stay,
<U+202D>  I fear, Heavn hath not orderd, though, before
<U+202D>  These late afflictions, it hath lent me store.
<U+202D>  O queen, deign pity then, since first to you
<U+202D>  My fate importunes my distress to vow.
<U+202D>  No other dame, nor man, that this Earth own,
<U+202D>  And neighbour city, I have seen or known.
<U+202D>  The town then show me; give my nakedness
<U+202D>  Some shroud to shelter it, if to these seas
<U+202D>  Linen or woollen you have brought to cleanse.
<U+202D>  God give you, in requital, all th amends
<U+202D>  Your heart can wish, a husband, family,
<U+202D>  And good agreement.  Nought beneath the sky
<U+202D>  More sweet, more worthy is, than firm consent
<U+202D>  Of man and wife in household government.
<U+202D>  It joys their wishers-well, their enemies wounds,
<U+202D>  But to themselves the special good redounds.
<U+202D>     She answerd:  Stranger!  I discern in thee
<U+202D>  Nor sloth, nor folly, reigns; and yet I see
<U+202D>  Th art poor and wretched.  In which I conclude,
<U+202D>  That industry nor wisdom make endued
<U+202D>  Men with those gifts that make them best to th eye;
<U+202D>  Jove only orders mans felicity.
<U+202D>  To good and bad his pleasure fashions still
<U+202D>  The whole proportion of their good and ill.
<U+202D>  And he, perhaps, hath formd this plight in thee,
<U+202D>  Of which thou must be patient, as he free.
<U+202D>  But after all thy wandrings, since thy way,
<U+202D>  Both to our earth, and near our city, lay,
<U+202D>  As being exposd to our cares to relieve,
<U+202D>  Weeds, and what else a human hand should give
<U+202D>  To one so suppliant and tamd with woe,
<U+202D>  Thou shalt not want.  Our city I will show,
<U+202D>  And tell our peoples name:  This neighbour town,
<U+202D>  And all this kingdom, the Phaacians own.
<U+202D>  And (since thou seemdst so fain to know my birth,
<U+202D>  And madst a question, if of heavn or earth.)
<U+202D>  This earth hath bred me; and my fathers name
<U+202D>  Alcinous is, that in the powr and frame
<U+202D>  Of this isles rule is supereminent.
<U+202D>     Thus, passing him, she to the virgins went,
<U+202D>  And said:  Give stay both to your feet and fright.
<U+202D>  Why thus disperse ye for a mans mere sight?
<U+202D>  Esteem you him a Cyclop, that long since
<U+202D>  Made use to prey upon our citizens?
<U+202D>  This man no moist man is, (nor watrish thing,  [5]
<U+202D>  Thats ever flitting, ever ravishing
<U+202D>  All it can compass; and, like it, doth range
<U+202D>  In rape of women, never stayd in change).
<U+202D>  This man is truly manly, wise, and stayd,  [6]
<U+202D>  In soul more rich the more to sense decayd,
<U+202D>  Who nor will do, nor suffer to be done,
<U+202D>  Acts lewd and abject; nor can such a one
<U+202D>  Greet the Phaacians with a mind envíous,
<U+202D>  Dear to the Gods they are, and he is pious,
<U+202D>  Besides, divided from the world we are,
<U+202D>  The out-part of it, billows circular
<U+202D>  The sea revolving round about our shore;
<U+202D>  Nor is there any man that enters more
<U+202D>  Than our own countrymen, with what is brought
<U+202D>  From other countries.  This man, minding nought
<U+202D>  But his relief, a poor unhappy wretch,
<U+202D>  Wrackd here, and hath no other land to fetch,
<U+202D>  Him now we must provide for.  From Jove come  [7]
<U+202D>  All strangers, and the needy of a home,
<U+202D>  Who any gift, though neer so small it be,
<U+202D>  Esteem as great, and take it gratefully.
<U+202D>  And therefore, virgins, give the stranger food,
<U+202D>  And wine; and see ye bathe him in the flood,
<U+202D>  Near to some shore to shelter most inclind.
<U+202D>  _To cold-bath-bathers hurtful is the wind,_
<U+202D>  Not only rugged making th outward skin,
<U+202D>  But by his thin powrs pierceth parts within.
<U+202D>     This said, their flight in a return they set,
<U+202D>  And did Ulysses with all grace entreat,
<U+202D>  Showd him a shore, wind-proof, and full of shade,
<U+202D>  By him a shirt and utter mantle laid,
<U+202D>  A golden jug of liquid oil did add,
<U+202D>  Bad wash, and all things as Nausicaa bad.
<U+202D>     Divine Ulysses would not use their aid;
<U+202D>  But thus bespake them:  Evry lovely maid,
<U+202D>  Let me entreat to stand a little by,  [8]
<U+202D>  That I, alone, the fresh flood may apply
<U+202D>  To cleanse my bosom of the sea-wrought brine,
<U+202D>  And then use oil, which long time did not shine
<U+202D>  On my poor shoulders.  Ill not wash in sight
<U+202D>  Of fair-haird maidens.  I should blush outright,
<U+202D>  To bathe all-bare by such a virgin light.
<U+202D>     They movd, and musd a man had so much grace,
<U+202D>  And told their mistress what a man he was.
<U+202D>     He cleansd his broad soild shoulders, back, and head
<U+202D>  Yet never tamd, but now had foam and weed
<U+202D>  Knit in the fair curls.  Which dissolvd, and he
<U+202D>  Slickd all with sweet oil, the sweet charity
<U+202D>  The untouchd virgin showd in his attire
<U+202D>  He clothd him with.  Then Pallas put a fire,
<U+202D>  More than before, into his sparkling eyes,
<U+202D>  His late soil set off with his soon fresh guise.
<U+202D>  His locks, cleansd, curld the more, and matchd, in powr
<U+202D>  To please an eye, the hyacinthian flowr.
<U+202D>  And as a workman, that can well combine
<U+202D>  Silver and gold, and make both strive to shine,
<U+202D>  As being by Vulcan, and Minerva too,
<U+202D>  Taught how far either may be urgd to go
<U+202D>  In strife of eminence, when work sets forth
<U+202D>  A worthy soul to bodies of such worth,
<U+202D>  No thought reproving th act, in any place,
<U+202D>  Nor Art no debt to Natures liveliest grace;
<U+202D>  So Pallas wrought in him a grace as great
<U+202D>  From head to shoulders, and ashore did seat
<U+202D>  His goodly presence.  To which such a guise
<U+202D>  He showd in going, that it ravishd eyes.
<U+202D>  All which continued, as he sat apart,
<U+202D>  Nausicaas eye struck wonder through her heart,
<U+202D>  Who thus bespake her consorts:  Hear me, you
<U+202D>  Fair-wristed virgins!  This rare man, I know,
<U+202D>  Treads not our country-earth, against the will
<U+202D>  Of some God thronéd on th Olympian hill.
<U+202D>  He showd to me, till now, not worth the note,
<U+202D>  But now he looks as he had godhead got.
<U+202D>  I would to heavn my husband were no worse,
<U+202D>  And would be calld no better, but the course
<U+202D>  Of other husbands pleasd to dwell out here.
<U+202D>  Observe and serve him with our utmost cheer.
<U+202D>     She said, they heard and did.  He drunk and eat
<U+202D>  Like to a harpy, having touchd no meat
<U+202D>  A long before time.  But Nausicaa now
<U+202D>  Thought of the more grace she did lately vow,
<U+202D>  Had horse to chariot joind, and up she rose,
<U+202D>  Up cheerd her guest, and said:  Guest, now dispose
<U+202D>  Yourself for town, that I may let you see
<U+202D>  My fathers court, where all the peers will be
<U+202D>  Of our Phaacian state.  At all parts, then,
<U+202D>  Observe to whom and what place y are t attain;
<U+202D>  Though I need usher you with no advice,
<U+202D>  Since I suppose you absolutely wise.
<U+202D>  While we the fields pass, and mens labours there,
<U+202D>  So long, in these maids guides, directly bear
<U+202D>  Upon my chariot (I must go before
<U+202D>  For cause that after comes, to which this more
<U+202D>  Be my induction) you shall then soon end
<U+202D>  Your way to town, whose towrs you see ascend  [9]
<U+202D>  To such a steepness.  On whose either side
<U+202D>  A fair port stands, to which is nothing wide
<U+202D>  An entrers passage; on whose both hands ride
<U+202D>  Ships in fair harbours; which once past, you win
<U+202D>  The goodly market-place (that circles in
<U+202D>  A fane to Neptune, built of curious stone,
<U+202D>  And passing ample) where munitión,
<U+202D>  Gables, and masts, men make, and polishd oars;
<U+202D>  For the Phaacians are not conquerors
<U+202D>  By bows nor quivers; oars, masts, ships they are
<U+202D>  With which they plough the sea, and wage their war.
<U+202D>  And now the cause comes why I lead the way,
<U+202D>  Not taking you to coach:  The men, that sway
<U+202D>  In work of those tools that so fit our state,
<U+202D>  Are rude mechanicals, that rare and late
<U+202D>  Work in the market-place; and those are they
<U+202D>  Whose bitter tongues I shun, who straight would say
<U+202D>  (For these vile vulgars are extremely proud,
<U+202D>  And foully-languagd)  What is he, allowd
<U+202D>  To coach it with Nausicaa, so large set,
<U+202D>  And fairly fashiond?  Where were these two met?
<U+202D>  He shall be sure her husband.  She hath been
<U+202D>  Gadding in some place, and, of foreign men
<U+202D>  Fitting her fancy, kindly brought him home
<U+202D>  In her own ship.  He must, of force, be come
<U+202D>  From some far region; we have no such man.
<U+202D>  It may be, praying hard, when her heart ran
<U+202D>  On some wishd husband, out of heavn some God
<U+202D>  Droppd in her lap; and there lies she at road
<U+202D>  Her cómplete life time.  But, in sooth, if she,
<U+202D>  Ranging abroad, a husband, such as he
<U+202D>  Whom now we saw, laid hand on, she was wise,
<U+202D>  For none of all our nobles are of prize
<U+202D>  Enough for her; he must beyond sea come,
<U+202D>  That wins her high mind, and will have her home.
<U+202D>  Of our peers many have importund her,
<U+202D>  Yet she will none.  Thus these folks will confer
<U+202D>  Behind my back; or, meeting, to my face
<U+202D>  The foul-mouth rout dare put home this disgrace;
<U+202D>  And this would be reproaches to my fame,
<U+202D>  For, evn myself just anger would inflame,
<U+202D>  If any other virgin I should see,
<U+202D>  Her parents living, keep the company
<U+202D>  Of any man to any end of love,
<U+202D>  Till open nuptials should her act approve.
<U+202D>  And therefore hear me, guest, and take such way,
<U+202D>  That you yourself may compass, in your stay,
<U+202D>  Your quick deduction by my fathers grace,
<U+202D>  And means to reach the root of all your race.
<U+202D>     We shall, not far out of our way to town,
<U+202D>  A never-felld grove find, that poplars crown,
<U+202D>  To Pallas sacred, where a fountain flows,
<U+202D>  And round about the grove a meadow grows,
<U+202D>  In which my father holds a manor-house,
<U+202D>  Deckd all with orchards, green, and odorous,
<U+202D>  As far from town as one may hear a shout.
<U+202D>  There stay, and rest your foot-pains, till full out
<U+202D>  We reach the city; where, when you may guess
<U+202D>  We are arrivd, and enter our access
<U+202D>  Within my fathers court, then put you on
<U+202D>  For our Phaacian state, where, to be shown
<U+202D>  My fathers house, desire.  Each infant there
<U+202D>  Can bring you to it; and yourself will clear
<U+202D>  Distinguish it from others, for no shows
<U+202D>  The city-buildings make compard with those
<U+202D>  That king Alcinous seat doth celebrate.
<U+202D>  In whose roofs, and the court (where men of state,
<U+202D>  And suitors sit and stay) when you shall hide,
<U+202D>  Straight pass it, entring further, where abide
<U+202D>  My mother, with her withdrawn housewifries,
<U+202D>  Who still sits in the fire-shine, and applies
<U+202D>  Her rock, all-purple, and of pompous show,
<U+202D>  Her chair placd gainst a pillar, all-a-row
<U+202D>  Her maids behind her set; and to her here
<U+202D>  My fathers dining-throne looks, seated where
<U+202D>  He pours his choice of wine in, like a God.
<U+202D>  This view once past, for th end of your abode,
<U+202D>  Address suit to my mother, that her mean
<U+202D>  May make the day of your redition seen,
<U+202D>  And you may frolic straight, though far away
<U+202D>  You are in distance from your wishéd stay.
<U+202D>  For, if she once be won to wish you well,
<U+202D>  Your hope may instantly your passport seal,
<U+202D>  And thenceforth sure abide to see your friends,
<U+202D>  Fair house, and all to which your heart contends.
<U+202D>     This said, she usd her shining scourge, and lashd
<U+202D>  Her mules, that soon the shore left where she washd,
<U+202D>  And, knowing well the way, their pace was fleet,
<U+202D>  And thick they gatherd up their nimble feet.
<U+202D>  Which yet she temperd so, and usd her scourge  [10]
<U+202D>  With so much skill, as not to over-urge
<U+202D>  The foot behind, and make them straggle so
<U+202D>  From close society.  Firm together go
<U+202D>  Ulysses and her maids.  And now the sun
<U+202D>  Sunk to the waters, when they all had won
<U+202D>  The never-felld, and sound-exciting, wood,
<U+202D>  Sacred to Pallas; where the god-like good
<U+202D>  Ulysses rested, and to Pallas prayd:
<U+202D>     Hear me, of goat-kept Jove th unconquerd Maid!  [11]
<U+202D>  Now throughly hear me, since, in all the time
<U+202D>  Of all my wrack, my prayrs could never climb
<U+202D>  Thy far-off ears; when noiseful Neptune tossd
<U+202D>  Upon his watry bristles my embossd
<U+202D>  And rock-torn body.  Hear yet now, and deign
<U+202D>  I may of the Phaacian state obtain
<U+202D>  Pity, and grace.  Thus prayd he, and she heard,
<U+202D>  By no means yet, exposd to sight, appeard,
<U+202D>  For fear t offend her uncle, the supreme
<U+202D>  Of all the Sea-Gods, whose wrath still extreme
<U+202D>  Stood to Ulysses; and would never cease,
<U+202D>  Till with his country shore he crownd his peace.
