ARMADO.
How hast thou purchased this experience?
MOTH.
By my penny of observation.
ARMADO.
But O--but O,--
MOTH.
'The hobby-horse is forgot.'
ARMADO.
Call'st thou my love 'hobby-horse'?
MOTH.
No, master; the hobby-horse is but a colt, and your love
perhaps, a hackney. But have you forgot your love?
ARMADO.
Almost I had.
MOTH.
Negligent student! learn her by heart.
ARMADO.
By heart and in heart, boy.
MOTH.
And out of heart, master: all those three I will prove.
ARMADO.
What wilt thou prove?
MOTH.
A man, if I live; and this, by, in, and without, upon the
instant: by heart you love her, because your heart cannot come by
her; in heart you love her, because your heart is in love with
her; and out of heart you love her, being out of heart that you
cannot enjoy her.
ARMADO.
I am all these three.
MOTH.
And three times as much more, and yet nothing at all.
ARMADO.
Fetch hither the swain: he must carry me a letter.
MOTH.
A message well sympathized; a horse to be ambassador for an
ass.
ARMADO.
Ha, ha! what sayest thou?
MOTH.
Marry, sir, you must send the ass upon the horse, for he is
very slow-gaited. But I go.
ARMADO.
The way is but short: away!
MOTH.
As swift as lead, sir.
ARMADO.
The meaning, pretty ingenious?
Is not lead a metal heavy, dull, and slow?
MOTH.
Minime, honest master; or rather, master, no.
ARMADO.
I say lead is slow.
MOTH.
You are too swift, sir, to say so:
Is that lead slow which is fir'd from a gun?
ARMADO.
Sweet smoke of rhetoric!
He reputes me a cannon; and the bullet, that's he;
I shoot thee at the swain.
MOTH.
Thump then, and I flee.
[Exit.]
ARMADO.
A most acute juvenal; volable and free of grace!
By thy favour, sweet welkin, I must sigh in thy face:
Most rude melancholy, valour gives thee place.
My herald is return'd.
[Re-enter MOTH with COSTARD.]
MOTH.
A wonder, master! here's a costard broken in a shin.
ARMADO.
Some enigma, some riddle: come, thy l'envoy; begin.
COSTARD.
No egma, no riddle, no l'envoy; no salve in the mail, sir.
O! sir, plantain, a plain plantain; no l'envoy, no l'envoy; no
salve, sir, but a plantain.
ARMADO.
By virtue thou enforcest laughter; thy silly thought, my
spleen; the heaving of my lungs provokes me to ridiculous
smiling: O! pardon me, my stars. Doth the inconsiderate take
salve for l'envoy, and the word l'envoy for a salve?
MOTH.
Do the wise think them other? Is not l'envoy a salve?
ARMADO.
No, page: it is an epilogue or discourse to make plain
Some obscure precedence that hath tofore been sain.
I will example it:
  The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
  Were still at odds, being but three.
There's the moral. Now the l'envoy.
MOTH.
I will add the l'envoy. Say the moral again.
ARMADO.
  The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
  Were still at odds, being but three.
