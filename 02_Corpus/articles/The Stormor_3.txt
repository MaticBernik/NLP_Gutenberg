CHAPTER II
_Of the Opinion of the Ancients, That this Island was more Subject to
Storms than other Parts of the World_
I am not of Opinion with the early Ages of the World, when these Islands
were first known, that they were the most Terrible of any Part of the
World for Storms and Tempests.
_Cambden_ tells us, The _Britains_ were distinguish'd from all the World
by unpassable Seas and terrible Northern Winds, which made the _Albion_
Shores dreadful to Sailors; and this part of the World was therefore
reckoned the utmost Bounds of the Northern known Land, beyond which none
had ever sailed: and quotes a great variety of ancient Authors to this
purpose; some of which I present as a Specimen.
      _Et Penitus Toto Divisos Orbe Britannos.
    Britain's_ disjoyn'd from all the well known World.
        _Quem Littus adusta,
    Horrescit Lybiae, ratibusq; Impervia_ [A]Thule
      _Ignotumq; Fretum_.
      Claud.
[A: Taken frequently for _Britain_.]
And if the Notions the World then had were true, it would be very absurd
for us who live here to pretend Miracles in any Extremes of Tempests;
since by what the Poets of those Ages flourish'd about stormy Weather,
was the native and most proper Epithet of the Place:
    _Belluosus qui remotis
    Obstrepit Oceanus_ Britannis.
      _Hor._
Nay, some are for placing the Nativity of the Winds hereabouts, as if
they had been all generated here, and the Confluence of Matter had made
this Island its General Rendezvouz.
But I shall easily show, that there are several Places in the World far
better adapted to be the General Receptacle or Centre of Vapours, to
supply a Fund of Tempestuous Matter, than _England_; as particularly the
vast Lakes of _North America_: Of which afterwards.
And yet I have two Notions, one real, one imaginary, of the Reasons
which gave the Ancients such terrible Apprehensions of this Part of the
World; which of late we find as Habitable and Navigable as any of the
rest.
The real Occasion I suppose thus: That before the Multitude and Industry
of Inhabitants prevail'd to the managing, enclosing, and improving the
Country, the vast Tract of Land in this Island which continually lay
open to the Flux of the Sea, and to the Inundations of Land-Waters, were
as so many standing Lakes; from whence the Sun continually exhaling vast
quantities of moist Vapours, the Air could not but be continually
crowded with all those Parts of necessary Matter to which we ascribe the
Original of Winds, Rains, Storms, and the like.
He that is acquainted with the situation of _England_, and can reflect
on the vast Quantities of flat Grounds, on the Banks of all our
navigable Rivers, and the Shores of the Sea, which Lands at Least lying
under Water every Spring-Tide, and being thereby continually full of
moisture, were like a stagnated standing body of Water brooding Vapours
in the Interval of the Tide, must own that at least a fifteenth part of
the whole Island may come into this Denomination.
