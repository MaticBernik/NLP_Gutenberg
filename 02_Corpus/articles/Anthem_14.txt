We have built strange things with this discovery of ours. We used
for it the copper wires which we found here under the ground. We
have walked the length of our tunnel, with a candle lighting the
way. We could go no farther [-that-] {+than+} half a mile, for earth and rock
had fallen at both ends. But we gathered all the things we found
and we brought them to our work place. We found strange boxes
with bars of metal inside, with many cords and strands and coils
of metal. We found wires that led to strange little globes of
glass on the walls; they contained threads of metal thinner than
a spider's web.
These things help us in our work. We do not understand them, but
we think that the men of the Unmentionable Times had known our
power of the sky, and these things had some relation to it. We do
not know, but we shall learn. We cannot stop now, even though it
frightens us that we are alone in our knowledge.
No single one can possess greater wisdom  [-that-] {+than+} the many Scholars
who are elected by all men for their wisdom. Yet we can. We do.
We have fought against saying it, but now it is said. We do not
care. We forget all men, all laws and all things save our metals
and our wires. So much is still to be learned! So long a road
lies before us, and what care we if we must travel it alone!
[-PART FOUR-]
{+Chapter Four+}
Many days passed before we could speak to the Golden One again.
But then came the day when the sky turned white, as if the sun
had burst and spread its flame in the air, and the fields lay
still without breath, and the dust of the road [-was-] {+what+} white in the
glow. So the women of the field were weary, and they tarried over
their work, and they were far from the road when we came. But the
Golden [-One-] {+one+} stood alone at the hedge, waiting. We stopped and we
saw that their eyes, so hard and scornful to the world, were
looking at us [-at-] {+as+} if they would obey any word we might speak.
And we said:
"We have [-give-] {+given+} you a name in our thoughts, Liberty 5-3000."
"What is our name?" they asked.
"The Golden One."
"Nor do we call you Equality 7-2521 when we think of you."
"What name have you given us?"
They looked straight into our eyes and they held their head high
and they answered:
"The Unconquered."
For a long time we could not speak. Then we said:
"Such thoughts [-as these-] are forbidden, Golden One."
"But you think such thoughts as these and you wish us to think
them."
We [-look-] {+looked+} into their {+eyes+} and we could not lie.
"Yes," we whispered, and they smiled, and then we said: "Our
dearest one, do not obey us."
They stepped back, and their eyes were wide and still.
