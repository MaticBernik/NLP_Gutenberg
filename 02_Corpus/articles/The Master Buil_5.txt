  MRS. SOLNESS enters by the door on the right.  She looks thin
  and wasted with grief, but shows traces of bygone beauty.
  Blonde ringlets.  Dressed with good taste, wholly in black.
  Speaks some-what slowly and in a plaintive voice.
MRS. SOLNESS.
[In the doorway.] Halvard!
SOLNESS.
[Turns.] Oh, are you there, my dear--?
MRS. SOLNESS.
[With a glance at KAIA.] I am afraid I am disturbing you.
SOLNESS.
Not in the least. Miss Fosli has only a short letter to write.
MRS. SOLNESS.
Yes, so I see.
SOLNESS.
What do you want with me, Aline?
MRS. SOLNESS.
I merely wanted to tell you that Dr. Herdal is in the drawing-room.
Won't you come and see him, Halvard?
SOLNESS.
[Looks suspiciously at her.]. H'm--is the doctor so very anxious to see
me?
MRS. SOLNESS.
Well, not exactly anxious. He really came to see me; but he would like
to say how-do-you-do to you at the same time.
SOLNESS.
[Laughs to himself.] Yes, I daresay. Well, you must ask him to wait a
little.
MRS. SOLNESS.
Then you will come in presently?
SOLNESS.
Perhaps I will. Presently, presently, dear. In a little while.
MRS. SOLNESS.
[Glancing again at KAIA.] Well now, don't forget, Halvard.
     [Withdraws and closes the door behind her.
KAIA.
[Softly.] Oh dear, oh dear--I am sure Mrs. Solness thinks ill of me in
some way!
SOLNESS.
Oh, not in the least. Not more than usual at any rate. But all the same,
you had better go now, Kaia.
KAIA.
Yes, yes, now I must go.
SOLNESS.
[Severely.] And mind you get that matter settled for me. Do you hear?
KAIA.
Oh, if it only depended on me--
SOLNESS.
I will have it settled, I say! And to-morrow too--not a day later!
KAIA.
[Terrified.] If there's nothing else for it, I am quite willing to break
off the engagement.
SOLNESS.
[Angrily.] Break it off. Are you mad? Would you think of breaking it
off?
KAIA.
[Distracted.] Yes, if necessary. For I must--I must stay here with you!
I can't leave you! That is utterly--utterly impossible!
SOLNESS.
[With a sudden outburst.] But deuce take it--how about Ragnar then! It's
Ragnar that I--
KAIA.
[Looks at him with terrified eyes.] It is chiefly on Ragnar's account,
that--that you--?
SOLNESS.
[Collecting himself.] No, no, of course not! You don't understand me
either. [Gently and softly.] Of course it is you I want to keep.--you
above everything, Kaia. But for that very reason, you must prevent
Ragnar, too, from throwing up his situation. There, there,--now go home.
KAIA.
Yes, yes--good-night, then.
SOLNESS.
Good night. [As she is going.] Oh, stop a moment! Are Ragnar's drawings
in there?
KAIA.
I did not see him take them with him.
SOLNESS.
Then just go and find them for me. I might perhaps glance over them,
after all.
KAIA.
[Happy.] Oh yes, please do!
SOLNESS.
For your sake, Kaia dear. Now, let me have them at once, please.
     [KAIA hurries into the draughtsmen's office, searches anxiously
       in the table-drawer, finds a portfolio and brings it with her.
