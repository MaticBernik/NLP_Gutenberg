The girl counted the notes in a businesslike manner, secured them in her
handbag, and rose.
Good morning, Mr. Whittington, she said politely. At least, au
revoir, I should say.
Exactly. Au revoir! Whittington looked almost genial again, a
reversion that aroused in Tuppence a faint misgiving. Au revoir, my
clever and charming young lady.
Tuppence sped lightly down the stairs. A wild elation possessed her. A
neighbouring clock showed the time to be five minutes to twelve.
Lets give Tommy a surprise! murmured Tuppence, and hailed a taxi.
The cab drew up outside the tube station. Tommy was just within the
entrance. His eyes opened to their fullest extent as he hurried forward
to assist Tuppence to alight. She smiled at him affectionately, and
remarked in a slightly affected voice:
Pay the thing, will you, old bean? Ive got nothing smaller than a
five-pound note!
CHAPTER III. A SET BACK
THE moment was not quite so triumphant as it ought to have been. To
begin with, the resources of Tommys pockets were somewhat limited. In
the end the fare was managed, the lady recollecting a plebeian twopence,
and the driver, still holding the varied assortment of coins in his
hand, was prevailed upon to move on, which he did after one last hoarse
demand as to what the gentleman thought he was giving him?
I think youve given him too much, Tommy, said Tuppence innocently. I
fancy he wants to give some of it back.
It was possibly this remark which induced the driver to move away.
Well, said Mr. Beresford, at length able to relieve his feelings,
what the--dickens, did you want to take a taxi for?
I was afraid I might be late and keep you waiting, said Tuppence
gently.
Afraid--you--might--be--late! Oh, Lord, I give it up! said Mr.
Beresford.
And really and truly, continued Tuppence, opening her eyes very wide,
I havent got anything smaller than a five-pound note.
You did that part of it very well, old bean, but all the same the
fellow wasnt taken in--not for a moment!
No, said Tuppence thoughtfully, he didnt believe it. Thats the
curious part about speaking the truth. No one does believe it. I found
that out this morning. Now lets go to lunch. How about the _Savoy?_
Tommy grinned.
How about the _Ritz?_
On second thoughts, I prefer the _Piccadilly_. Its nearer. We shant
have to take another taxi. Come along.
Is this a new brand of humour? Or is your brain really unhinged?
 inquired Tommy.
Your last supposition is the correct one. I have come into money, and
the shock has been too much for me! For that particular form of mental
trouble an eminent physician recommends unlimited _Hors douvre_,
Lobster _a laméricane_, Chicken Newberg, and Peche Melba! Lets go
and get them!
Tuppence, old girl, what has really come over you?
Oh, unbelieving one! Tuppence wrenched open her bag. Look here, and
here, and here!
Great Jehosaphat! My dear girl, dont wave Fishers aloft like that!
