ACT III.
SCENE I.--FRANCE. ROOM IN THE FRENCH KING'S PALACE.
  _Trumpets sound._
    _Enter the FRENCH KING, the DAUPHIN, DUKE OF BOURBON, the
    CONSTABLE OF FRANCE, and others, L.H._
  _Fr. King._ (C.) 'Tis certain he hath pass'd the river Somme.
  _Con._ (R.C.) And if he be not fought withal, my lord,
  Let us not live in France; let us quit all,
  And give our vineyards to a barbarous people.
  _Dau._ (R.) By faith and honour,
  Our madams mock at us;
  They bid us--to the English dancing-schools,
  And teach lavoltas high[1] and swift corantos;[2]
  Saying our grace is only in our heels,
  And that we are most lofty runaways.
  _Fr. King._ Where is Montjoy the herald? speed him hence:
  Let him greet England with our sharp defiance.--
  Up, princes! and, with spirit of honour edg'd
  More sharper than your swords, hie to the field:
  Bar Harry England, that sweeps through our land
  With pennons[3] painted in the blood of Harfleur:
  Go down upon him,--you have power enough,--
  And in a captive chariot into Rouen
  Bring him our prisoner.
  _Con._              This becomes the great.
  Sorry am I his numbers are so few,
  His soldiers sick, and famish'd in their march;
  For, I am sure, when he shall see our army,
  He'll drop his heart into the sink of fear,
  And, for achievement offer us his ransom.[4]
  _Fr. King._ Therefore, lord constable, haste on Montjoy;
    [_CONSTABLE crosses to L._
  And let him say to England, that we send
  To know what willing ransom he will give.--
  Prince Dauphin, you shall stay with us in Rouen.
  _Dau._ Not so, I do beseech your majesty.
  _Fr. King._ Be patient; for you shall remain with us.--
  Now, forth, lord constable (_Exit CONSTABLE, L.H._), and princes all,
  And quickly bring us word of England's fall.
    [_Exeunt L.H._
    _Trumpets sound._
    [Footnote III.1: _----lavoltas high_] A dance in which there was
    much turning, and much capering.]
    [Footnote III.2: _----swift corantos;_] A corant is a sprightly
    dance.]
    [Footnote III.3: _With +pennons+_] _Pennons_ armorial were small
    flags, on which the arms, device, and motto of a knight were
    painted.]
SCENE II.--A VIEW IN PICARDY.
  _Distant Battle heard._
    _Enter GOWER, L.U.E., meeting FLUELLEN, R.H._
_Gow._ (C.) How now, Captain Fluellen! come you from the bridge?(A)
_Flu._ (R.C.) I assure you, there is very excellent service committed at
the pridge.
