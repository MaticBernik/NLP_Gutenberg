_Mir._        Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.
_Pros._ To have no screen between this part he play'd
And him he play'd it for, he needs will be
Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library
Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties                    110
He thinks me now incapable; confederates,
So dry he was for sway, wi' the King of Naples
To give him annual tribute, do him homage,
Subject his coronet to his crown, and bend
The dukedom, yet unbow'd,--alas, poor Milan!--                     115
To most ignoble stooping.
_Mir._                  O the heavens!
_Pros._ Mark his condition, and th' event; then tell me
If this might be a brother.
_Mir._                    I should sin
To think but nobly of my grandmother:
Good wombs have borne bad sons.
_Pros._                       Now the condition.                   120
This King of Naples, being an enemy
To me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit;
Which was, that he, in lieu o' the premises,
Of homage and I know not how much tribute,
Should presently extirpate me and mine                             125
Out of the dukedom, and confer fair Milan,
With all the honours, on my brother: whereon,
A treacherous army levied, one midnight
Fated to the purpose, did Antonio open
The gates of Milan; and, i' the dead of darkness,                  130
The ministers for the purpose hurried thence
Me and thy crying self.
_Mir._                Alack, for pity!
I, not remembering how I cried out then,
Will cry it o'er again: it is a hint
That wrings mine eyes to't.
_Pros._                   Hear a little further,                   135
And then I'll bring thee to the present business
Which now's upon 's; without the which, this story
Were most impertinent.
_Mir._               Wherefore did they not
That hour destroy us?
_Pros._             Well demanded, wench:
My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,              140
So dear the love my people bore me; nor set
A mark so bloody on the business; but
With colours fairer painted their foul ends.
In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,
Bore us some leagues to sea; where they prepared                   145
A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd,
Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats
Instinctively have quit it: there they hoist us,
To cry to the sea that roar'd to us; to sigh
To the winds, whose pity, sighing back again,                      150
Did us but loving wrong.
_Mir._                 Alack, what trouble
Was I then to you!
_Pros._          O, a cherubin
Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile,
Infused with a fortitude from heaven,
When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt,                   155
Under my burthen groan'd; which raised in me
An undergoing stomach, to bear up
Against what should ensue.
_Mir._                   How came we ashore?
_Pros._ By Providence divine.
Some food we had, and some fresh water, that                       160
A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,
Out of his charity, who being then appointed
Master of this design, did give us, with
Rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries,
Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness,              165
Knowing I loved my books, he furnish'd me
From mine own library with volumes that
I prize above my dukedom.
