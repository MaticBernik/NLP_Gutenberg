This fall of the Angels, with the war in Heaven which preceded it, is
finely describ'd by _Ovid_, in his war of the _Titans_ against
_Jupiter_; casting mountain upon mountain, and hill upon hill (_Pelion_
upon _Ossa_) in order to scale the Adamantine walls, and break open the
gates of _Heaven_; till _Jupiter_ struck them with his thunder-bolts and
overwhelm'd them in the abyss: _Vide Ovid Metam._ new translation, lib.
i. p. 19.
  "Nor were the Gods themselves secure on high,
  "For now the _Gyants_ strove to storm _the sky_,
  "The lawless brood with bold attempt invade
  "THE GODS, and mountains upon mountains _laid_.
    "But now the _bolt_, enrag'd _the Father_ took,
  "_Olympus_ from her deep foundations shook,
  "Their structure nodded at the mighty stroke,
  "And _Ossa_'s shatter'd top o'er _Pelion_ broke,
  "They're in their own ungodly ruines slain.--
Then again speaking of _Jupiter_, resolving in council to destroy
mankind by a deluge, and giving the reasons of it to the heavenly Host,
say thus, speaking of the demy-Gods alluding to good men below.
  "Think you that they in safety can remain,
  "When I my self who o'er Immortals reign,
  "Who send the lightning, and Heaven's empire sway,
  "The stern [4] Lycaon practis'd to betray.

Since then so much poetic liberty is taken with the Devil, relating to
his most early state, and the time before his fall, give me leave to
make an excursion of the like kind, relating to his History immediately
after the fall, and till the creation of man; an interval which I think
much of the Devil's story is to be seen in, and which Mr. _Milton_ has
taken little notice of, at least it does not seem compleatly fill'd up;
after which I shall return to honest Prose again, and persue the duty of
an Historian.
    _Satan_, with hideous ruin thus supprest
  _Expell'd_ the seat of blessedness and rest,
  Look'd back and saw the _high eternal mound_,
  Where all _his rebel host_ their _outlet_ found
  _Restor'd impregnable_: The breach made up,
  And garrisons of Angels rang'd a top;
  In front a hundred thousand thunders roll,
  And lightnings temper'd to transfix a soul,
  Terror of _Devils_. _Satan_ and his host,
  Now to themselves _as well as station lost_,
  Unable to support the hated sight,                  }
  Expand _seraphic wings_, and swift as light         }
  Seek for new safety in _eternal Night_.             }
    In the remotest gulphs _of dark_ they land,
  Here vengeance gives them leave to make their stand,
  Not that to _steps_ and _measures_ they pretend,
  _Councils_ and _schemes_ their station to defend;
  But broken, disconcerted and _dismay'd_,
  By guilt and fright to guilt and fright _betray'd_;
  Rage and confusion ev'ry Spirit possess'd,
  And _shame_ and _horror_ swell'd in ev'ry breast;
  Transforming envy to their essentials burns,
  And _the bright_ Angel to a _frightful Devil_ turns.
    _Thus Hell began_; the fire of conscious rage
  No years can quench, no length of time asswage.
  _Material Fire_, with its intensest flame,
  Compar'd _with this_ can scarce deserve a Name;
  How should it up to _immaterials_ rise,
  When we're _all flame_, we shall _all fire_ despise.
    This fire outrageous and its heat intense
  Turns all the pain _of loss_ to pain _of sense_.
  The folding flames _concave_ and _inward_ roll,
  Act _upon spirit_ and penetrate _the soul_:
  Not force of _Devils_ can its new powers repel,
  Where'er it burns _it finds_ or _makes_ a HELL;
  For _Satan_ flaming with unquench'd desire
  Forms _his own Hell_, and kindles _his own fire_,
  Vanquish'd, _not humbl'd_, not in will brought low,
  But as _his powers_ decline _his passions_ grow:
  The malice, _Viper like_, takes vent within,
  Gnaws its own bowels, and bursts in _its own sin_:
  Impatient of the change _he scorns to bow_,
  And never _impotent_ in power _till now_;
  Ardent with hate, and _with revenge_ distract,
  A will to new attempts, _but none_ to act;
  Yet all _seraphick_, and in just degree,
  Suited _to Spirits high sense_ of misery,
  Deriv'd from _loss_ which _nothing_ can repair,
  And _room for nothing left_ but meer despair.
  _Here's finish'd Hell!_ what fiercer fire _can burn_?
  Enough ten thousand Worlds to over-turn.
    HELL's but the frenzy of defeated pride,
  Seraphick Treason's strong impetuous tide,
  Where vile ambition _disappointed_ first,
  To its _own rage_ and _boundless hatred_ curst;
  The hate's _fan'd up to fury_, that to _flame_,
  For _fire_ and _fury_ are in kind the same;
  These burn unquenchable in every face,
  And the word ENDLESS constitutes the place.
