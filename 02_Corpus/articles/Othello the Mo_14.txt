[Enter Roderigo.]
IAGO.
[Aside to him.] How now, Roderigo!
I pray you, after the lieutenant; go.
[Exit Roderigo.]
MONTANO.
And 'tis great pity that the noble Moor
Should hazard such a place as his own second
With one of an ingraft infirmity:
It were an honest action to say
So to the Moor.
IAGO.
Not I, for this fair island;
I do love Cassio well; and would do much
To cure him of this evil.--But, hark! What noise?
[Cry within,--"Help! help!"]
[Re-enter Cassio, driving in Roderigo.]
CASSIO.
You rogue! you rascal!
MONTANO.
What's the matter, lieutenant?
CASSIO.
A knave teach me my duty! I'll beat the knave into
a twiggen bottle.
RODERIGO.
Beat me!
CASSIO.
Dost thou prate, rogue? [Striking Roderigo.]
MONTANO.
Nay, good lieutenant; I pray you, sir, hold your hand.
CASSIO.
Let me go, sir, or I'll knock you o'er the mazard.
MONTANO.
Come, come, you're drunk.
CASSIO.
Drunk!
[They fight.]
IAGO.
[Aside to Roderigo.] Away, I say! go out and cry a mutiny.
[Exit Roderigo.] 
Nay, good lieutenant,--alas,, gentlemen:--
Help, ho!--Lieutenant,--sir,--Montano,--sir:--
Help, masters!--Here's a goodly watch indeed!
[Bell rings.]
Who's that that rings the bell?--Diablo, ho!
The town will rise: God's will, lieutenant, hold;
You will be sham'd forever.
[Re-enter Othello and Attendants.]
OTHELLO.
What is the matter here?
MONTANO.
Zounds, I bleed still; I am hurt to the death.
OTHELLO.
Hold, for your lives!
IAGO.
Hold, ho! lieutenant,--sir,--Montano,--gentlemen,--
Have you forgot all sense of place and duty?
Hold! the general speaks to you; hold, hold, for shame!
OTHELLO.
Why, how now, ho! from whence ariseth this?
Are we turn'd Turks, and to ourselves do that
Which Heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?
For Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl:
He that stirs next to carve for his own rage
Holds his soul light; he dies upon his motion.--
Silence that dreadful bell; it frights the isle
From her propriety.--What is the matter, masters?--
Honest Iago, that look'st dead with grieving,
Speak, who began this? on thy love, I charge thee.
IAGO.
I do not know:--friends all but now, even now,
In quarter, and in terms like bride and groom
Devesting them for bed; and then, but now--
As if some planet had unwitted men,--
Swords out, and tilting one at other's breast
In opposition bloody. I cannot speak
Any beginning to this peevish odds;
And would in action glorious I had lost
Those legs that brought me to a part of it!
OTHELLO.
How comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?
CASSIO.
I pray you, pardon me; I cannot speak.
OTHELLO.
Worthy Montano, you were wont be civil;
The gravity and stillness of your youth
The world hath noted, and your name is great
In mouths of wisest censure: what's the matter,
That you unlace your reputation thus,
And spend your rich opinion for the name
Of a night-brawler? give me answer to it.
MONTANO.
Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger:
Your officer, Iago, can inform you,--
While I spare speech, which something now offends me,--
Of all that I do know: nor know I aught
By me that's said or done amiss this night:
Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice,
And to defend ourselves it be a sin
When violence assails us.
