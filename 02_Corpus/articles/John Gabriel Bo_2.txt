ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Slowly.]  I wanted to smooth the way for Erhart to happiness
in life.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Contemptuously.]  Pooh--people situated as we are have something
else than happiness to think of.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  What, then?
MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Looking steadily and earnestly at her.]  Erhart has in the first
place to make so brilliant a position for himself, that no trace
shall be left of the shadow his father has cast upon my name--and
my son's.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Searchingly.]  Tell me, Gunhild, is this what Erhart himself
demands of his life?
MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Slightly taken aback.]  Yes, I should hope so!
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Is it not rather what you demand of him?
MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Curtly.]  Erhart and I always make the same demands upon
ourselves.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Sadly and slowly.]  You are so very certain of your boy, then,
Gunhild?
MRS. BORKMAN.
  [With veiled triumph.]  Yes, that I am--thank Heaven.  You may
be sure of that!
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Then I should think in reality you must be happy after all; in
spite of all the rest.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  So I am--so far as that goes.  But then, every moment, all the
rest comes rushing in upon me like a storm.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [With a change of tone.]  Tell me--you may as well tell me at
once--for that is really what I have come for----
MRS. BORKMAN.
  What?
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Something I felt I must talk to you about.--Tell me--Erhart does
not live out here with--with you others?
MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Harshly.]  Erhart cannot live out here with me.  He has to live
in town----
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  So he wrote to me.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  He must, for the sake of his studies.  But he comes out to me
for a little while every evening.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Well, may I see him then?  May I speak to him at once?
MRS. BORKMAN.
  He has not come yet; but I expect him every moment.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Why, Gunhild, surely he must have come.  I can hear his footsteps
overhead.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  [With a rapid upward glance.]  Up in the long gallery?
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Yes.  I have heard him walking up and down there ever since
I came.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Looking away from her.]  That is not Erhart, Ella.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Surprised.]  Not Erhart?  [Divining.]  Who is it then?
MRS. BORKMAN.
  It is he.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Softly, with suppressed pain.]  Borkman?  John Gabriel Borkman?
MRS. BORKMAN.
  He walks up and down like that--backwards and forwards--from
morning to night--day out and day in.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  I have heard something of this----
MRS. BORKMAN.
  I daresay.  People find plenty to say about us, no doubt.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Erhart has spoken of it in his letters.  He said that his father
generally remained by himself--up there--and you alone down here.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  Yes; that is how it has been, Ella, ever since they let him out,
and sent him home to me.  All these long eight years.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  I never believed it could really be so.  It seemed impossible!
