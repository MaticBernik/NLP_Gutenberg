Being heated when he arrived at this climax, Josiah Bounderby of Coketown
stopped.  He stopped just as his eminently practical friend, still
accompanied by the two young culprits, entered the room.  His eminently
practical friend, on seeing him, stopped also, and gave Louisa a
reproachful look that plainly said, Behold your Bounderby!
Well! blustered Mr. Bounderby, whats the matter?  What is young
Thomas in the dumps about?
He spoke of young Thomas, but he looked at Louisa.
We were peeping at the circus, muttered Louisa, haughtily, without
lifting up her eyes, and father caught us.
And, Mrs. Gradgrind, said her husband in a lofty manner, I should as
soon have expected to find my children reading poetry.
Dear me, whimpered Mrs. Gradgrind.  How can you, Louisa and Thomas!  I
wonder at you.  I declare youre enough to make one regret ever having
had a family at all.  I have a great mind to say I wish I hadnt.  _Then_
what would you have done, I should like to know?
Mr. Gradgrind did not seem favourably impressed by these cogent remarks.
He frowned impatiently.
As if, with my head in its present throbbing state, you couldnt go and
look at the shells and minerals and things provided for you, instead of
circuses! said Mrs. Gradgrind.  You know, as well as I do, no young
people have circus masters, or keep circuses in cabinets, or attend
lectures about circuses.  What can you possibly want to know of circuses
then?  I am sure you have enough to do, if thats what you want.  With my
head in its present state, I couldnt remember the mere names of half the
facts you have got to attend to.
Thats the reason! pouted Louisa.
Dont tell me thats the reason, because it cant be nothing of the
sort, said Mrs. Gradgrind.  Go and be somethingological directly.
Mrs. Gradgrind was not a scientific character, and usually dismissed her
children to their studies with this general injunction to choose their
pursuit.
In truth, Mrs. Gradgrinds stock of facts in general was woefully
defective; but Mr. Gradgrind in raising her to her high matrimonial
position, had been influenced by two reasons.  Firstly, she was most
satisfactory as a question of figures; and, secondly, she had no
nonsense about her.  By nonsense he meant fancy; and truly it is
probable she was as free from any alloy of that nature, as any human
being not arrived at the perfection of an absolute idiot, ever was.
The simple circumstance of being left alone with her husband and Mr.
Bounderby, was sufficient to stun this admirable lady again without
collision between herself and any other fact.  So, she once more died
away, and nobody minded her.
Bounderby, said Mr. Gradgrind, drawing a chair to the fireside, you
are always so interested in my young peopleparticularly in Louisathat I
make no apology for saying to you, I am very much vexed by this
discovery.  I have systematically devoted myself (as you know) to the
education of the reason of my family.  The reason is (as you know) the
only faculty to which education should be addressed.  And yet,
Bounderby, it would appear from this unexpected circumstance of to-day,
though in itself a trifling one, as if something had crept into Thomass
and Louisas minds which isor rather, which is notI dont know that I
can express myself better than by sayingwhich has never been intended to
be developed, and in which their reason has no part.
