<U+202D>[7] Ascent to his countrys shore.
<U+202D>[8] Eustathius will have this comparison of the Phaacians with the
<U+202D>Giants and Cyclops to proceed out of the inveterate virulency of
<U+202D>Antinous to the Cyclops; who were cause (as is before said) of
<U+202D>their remove from their country; and with great endeavour labours
<U+202D>the approbation of it; but (under his peace) from the purpose:  for
<U+202D>the sense of the Poet is clear, that the Cyclops and Giants being in
<U+202D>part the issue of the Gods, and yet afterward their defiers, (as
<U+202D>Polyp. hereafter dares profess) Antinous (out of bold and manly
<U+202D>reason, even to the face of one that might have been a God, for the
<U+202D>past manly appearance he made there) would tell him, and the rest
<U+202D>in him, that if they graced those Cyclops with their open
<U+202D>appearance, that, though descended from them, durst yet deny
<U+202D>them, they might much more do them the honour of their open
<U+202D>presence that adored them.

<U+202D>  THE EIGHTH BOOK OF HOMERS ODYSSEYS
<U+202D>  THE ARGUMENT
<U+202D>  The Peers of the Phaacian State
<U+202D>  A Council call, to consolate
<U+202D>  Ulysses with all means for home.
<U+202D>  The Council to a banquet come,
<U+202D>  Invited by the King.  Which done,
<U+202D>  Assays for hurling of the stone
<U+202D>  The youths make with the stranger-king.
<U+202D>  Demodocus, at feast, doth sing
<U+202D>  Th adultry of the God of Arms
<U+202D>  With Her that rules in amorous charms;
<U+202D>  And after sings the entercourse
<U+202D>  Of acts about th Epaan horse.
<U+202D>  ANOTHER ARGUMENT
<U+202D>  _<U+0398><U+03B7><U+0311><U+03C4><U+03B1>._
<U+202D>     The councils frame
<U+202D>        At fleet applied.
<U+202D>     In strifes of game
<U+202D>        Ulysses tried.
<U+202D>  Now when the rosy-fingerd Morn arose,
<U+202D>  The sacred powr Alcinous did dispose
<U+202D>  Did likewise rise; and, like him, left his ease
<U+202D>  The city-razer Laertiades.
<U+202D>  The Council at the navy was designd;
<U+202D>  To which Alcinous, with the sacred mind,
<U+202D>  Came first of all.  On polishd stones they sate,
<U+202D>  Near to the navy.  To increase the state,
<U+202D>  Minerva took the heralds form on her,
<U+202D>  That servd Alcinous, studious to prefer
<U+202D>  Ulysses suit for home.  About the town
<U+202D>  She made quick way, and filld with the renown
<U+202D>  Of that design the ears of evry man,
<U+202D>  Proclaiming thus:  Peers Phaacensian!
<U+202D>  And Men of Council, all haste to the court,
<U+202D>  To hear the stranger that made late resort
<U+202D>  To King Alcinous, long time lost at sea,
<U+202D>  And is in person like a Deity.
<U+202D>     This all their powrs set up, and spirit instilld,
<U+202D>  And straight the court and seats with men were filld.
<U+202D>  The whole state wonderd at Laertes son,
<U+202D>  When they beheld him.  Pallas put him on
<U+202D>  A supernatural and heavnly dress,
<U+202D>  Enlargd him with a height, and goodliness
<U+202D>  In breast and shoulders, that he might appear
<U+202D>  Gracious, and grave, and reverend, and bear
<U+202D>  A perfect hand on his performance there
<U+202D>  In all the trials they resolvd t impose.
<U+202D>     All met, and gatherd in attention close,
<U+202D>  Alcinous thus bespake them:  Dukes, and lords,
<U+202D>  Hear me digest my hearty thoughts in words.
<U+202D>  This stranger here, whose travels found my court,
<U+202D>  I know not, nor can tell if his resort
<U+202D>  From East or West comes; but his suit is this:
<U+202D>  That to his country-earth we would dismiss
<U+202D>  His hither-forcéd person, and doth bear
<U+202D>  The mind to pass it under evry peer;
<U+202D>  Whom I prepare, and stir up, making known
<U+202D>  My free desire of his deductión.
<U+202D>  Nor shall there ever any other man
<U+202D>  That tries the goodness Phaacensian
<U+202D>  In me, and my courts entertainment, stay,
<U+202D>  Mourning for passage, under least delay.
<U+202D>  Come then, a ship into the sacred seas,
<U+202D>  New-built, now launch we; and from out our prease
<U+202D>  Choose two-and-fifty youths, of all, the best
<U+202D>  To use an oar.  All which see straight imprest,
<U+202D>  And in their oar-bound seats.  Let others hie
<U+202D>  Home to our court, commanding instantly
<U+202D>  The solemn preparation of a feast,
<U+202D>  In which provision may for any guest
<U+202D>  Be made at my charge.  Charge of these low things
<U+202D>  I give our youth.  You, sceptre-bearing kings,
<U+202D>  Consort me home, and help with grace to use
<U+202D>  This guest of ours; no one man shall refuse.
<U+202D>     Some other of you haste, and call to us
<U+202D>  The sacred singer, grave Demodocus,
<U+202D>  To whom hath God givn song that can excite
<U+202D>  The heart of whom he listeth with delight.
<U+202D>  This said, he led.  The sceptre-bearers lent
<U+202D>  Their free attendance; and with all speed went
<U+202D>  The herald for the sacred man-in-song.
<U+202D>  Youths two-and-fifty, chosen from the throng,
<U+202D>  Went, as was willd, to the untamd seas shore;
<U+202D>  Where come, they launchd the ship, the mast it bore
<U+202D>  Advancd, sails hoiséd, evry seat his oar
<U+202D>  Gave with a leather thong.  The deep moist then
<U+202D>  They further reachd.  The dry streets flowd with men,
<U+202D>  That troopd up to the kings capacious court,
<U+202D>  Whose porticos were chokd with the resort,
<U+202D>  Whose walls were hung with men, young, old, thrust there
<U+202D>  In mighty concourse; for whose promisd cheer
<U+202D>  Alcinous slew twelve sheep, eight white-toothd swine,
<U+202D>  Two crook-haunchd beeves; which flayd and dressd, divine
<U+202D>  The show was of so many a jocund guest,
<U+202D>  All set together at so set a feast.
<U+202D>  To whose accomplishd state the herald then
<U+202D>  The lovely singer led; who past all mean
<U+202D>  The Muse affected, gave him good, and ill,
<U+202D>  His eyes put out, but put in soul at will.
<U+202D>  His place was givn him in a chair all gracd
<U+202D>  With silver studs, and gainst a pillar placd:
<U+202D>  Where, as the centre to the state, he rests,
<U+202D>  And round about the circle of the guests.
<U+202D>  The herald on a pin above his head
<U+202D>  His soundful harp hung, to whose height he led
<U+202D>  His hand for taking of it down at will,
<U+202D>  A board set by with food, and forth did fill
<U+202D>  A bowl of wine, to drink at his desire.
<U+202D>  The rest then fell to feast, and, when the fire
<U+202D>  Of appetite was quenchd, the Muse inflamd
<U+202D>  The sacred singer.  Of men highliest famd
<U+202D>  He sung the glories, and a poem pennd,
<U+202D>  That in applause did ample heavn ascend.
<U+202D>  Whose subject was, the stern Contentión
<U+202D>  Betwixt Ulysses and great Thetis son,
<U+202D>  As, at a banquet sacred to the Gods,
<U+202D>  In dreadful language they expressd their odds.
<U+202D>  When Agamemnon sat rejoicd in soul
<U+202D>  To hear the Greek peers jar in terms so foul;
<U+202D>  For augur Phobus in presage had told
<U+202D>  The King of men (desirous to unfold
<U+202D>  The wars perplexd end, and being therefore gone
<U+202D>  In heavnly Pythia to the porch of stone,)
<U+202D>  That then the end of all griefs should begin
<U+202D>  Twixt Greece and Troy, when Greece (with strife to win
<U+202D>  That wishd conclusion) in her kings should jar,
<U+202D>  And plead, if force or wit must end the war.
<U+202D>     This brave Contention did the poet sing,
<U+202D>  Expressing so the spleen of either king,
<U+202D>  That his large purple weed Ulysses held
<U+202D>  Before his face and eyes, since thence distilld
<U+202D>  Tears uncontaind; which he obscurd, in fear
<U+202D>  To let th observing presence note a tear.
<U+202D>  But, when his sacred song the mere divine
<U+202D>  Had givn an end, a goblet crownd with wine
<U+202D>  Ulysses, drying his wet eyes, did seize,  [1]
<U+202D>  And sacrificd to those Gods that would please
<U+202D>  T inspire the poet with a song so fit
<U+202D>  To do him honour, and renown his wit.
<U+202D>  His tears then stayd.  But when again began,
<U+202D>  By all the kings desires, the moving man,
<U+202D>  Again Ulysses could not choose but yield
<U+202D>  To that soft passion, which again, withheld,
<U+202D>  He kept so cunningly from sight, that none,
<U+202D>  Except Alcinous himself alone,
<U+202D>  Discernd him movd so much.  But he sat next,
<U+202D>  And heard him deeply sigh; which his pretext
<U+202D>  Could not keep hid from him.  Yet he conceald
<U+202D>  His uttrance of it, and would have it held
<U+202D>  From all the rest, brake off the song, and this
<U+202D>  Said to those oar-affecting peers of his:
<U+202D>     Princes, and peers!  We now are satiate
<U+202D>  With sacred song that fits a feast of state,
<U+202D>  With wine and food.  Now then to field, and try
<U+202D>  In all kinds our approvd activity,
<U+202D>  That this our guest may give his friends to know,
<U+202D>  In his return, that we as little owe
<U+202D>  To fights and wrastlings, leaping, speed-of race,
<U+202D>  As these our court-rites; and commend our grace
<U+202D>  In all to all superior.  Forth he led,
<U+202D>  The peers and people troopd up to their head.
<U+202D>  Nor must Demodocus be left within;
<U+202D>  Whose harp the herald hung upon the pin,
<U+202D>  His hand in his took, and abroad he brought
<U+202D>  The heavnly poet, out the same way wrought
<U+202D>  That did the princes, and what they would see
<U+202D>  With admiration, with his company
<U+202D>  They wishd to honour.  To the place of game
<U+202D>  These throngd; and after routs of other came,
<U+202D>  Of all sort, infinite.  Of youths that strove,
<U+202D>  Many and strong rose to their trials love.
<U+202D>  Up rose Acroneus, and Ocyalus,
<U+202D>  Elatreus, Prymneus, and Anchialus,  [2]
<U+202D>  Nauteus, Eretmeus, Thoen, Proreüs,
<U+202D>  Pontëus, and the strong Amphialus
<U+202D>  Son to Tectonides Polyneüs.
<U+202D>  Up rose to these the great Euryalus,
<U+202D>  In action like the Homicide of War.
<U+202D>  Naubolides, that was for person far
<U+202D>  Past all the rest, but one he could not pass,
<U+202D>  Nor any thought improve, Laodamas.
<U+202D>  Up Anabesinëus then arose;
<U+202D>  And three sons of the Sceptre-state, and those
<U+202D>  Were Halius, the fore-praisd Laodamas,
<U+202D>  And Clytonëus like a God in grace.
<U+202D>  These first the foot-game tried, and from the lists
<U+202D>  Took start together.  Up the dust in mists
<U+202D>  They hurld about, as in their speed they flew;
<U+202D>  But Clytonëus first of all the crew
<U+202D>  A stitchs length in any fallow field
<U+202D>  Made good his pace; when, where the judges yield
<U+202D>  The prize and praise, his glorious speed arrivd.
<U+202D>  Next, for the boistrous wrastling game they strivd;
<U+202D>  At which Euryalus the rest outshone.
<U+202D>  At leap Amphialus, At the hollow stone
<U+202D>  Elatreüs excelld.  At buffets, last,
<U+202D>  Laodamas, the kings fair son, surpast.
<U+202D>     When all had strivd in these assays their fill,
<U+202D>  Laodamas said:  Come friends, lets prove what skill
<U+202D>  This stranger hath attaind to in our sport.
<U+202D>  Methinks, he must be of the active sort,
<U+202D>  His calves, thighs, hands, and well-knit shoulders show
<U+202D>  That Nature disposition did bestow
<U+202D>  To fit with fact their form.  Nor wants he prime.
<U+202D>  But sour affliction, made a mate with time,
<U+202D>  Makes time the more seen.  Nor imagine I,
<U+202D>  A worse thing to enforce debility
<U+202D>  Than is the sea, though nature neer so strong
<U+202D>  Knits one together.  Nor conceive you wrong,
<U+202D>  Replied Euryalus,  but prove his blood
<U+202D>  With what you question.  In the midst then stood
<U+202D>  Renownd Laodamas, and provd him thus:
<U+202D>     Come, stranger-father, and assay with us
<U+202D>  Your powrs in these contentions.  If your show
<U+202D>  Be answerd with your worth, tis fit that you
<U+202D>  Should know these conflicts.  Nor doth glory stand
<U+202D>  On any worth more, in a mans command,
<U+202D>  Than to be strenuous both of foot and hand.
<U+202D>  Come then, make proof with us, discharge your mind
<U+202D>  Of discontentments; for not far behind
<U+202D>  Comes your deduction, ship is ready now,  [3]
<U+202D>  And men, and all things.  Why,  said he,  dost thou
<U+202D>  Mock me, Laodamas, and these strifes bind
<U+202D>  My powrs to answer?  I am more inclind
<U+202D>  To cares than conflict.  Much sustaind I have,
<U+202D>  And still am suffring.  I come here to crave,
<U+202D>  In your assemblies, means to be dismist,
<U+202D>  And pray both kings and subjects to assist.
<U+202D>     Euryalus an open brawl began,
<U+202D>  And said:  I take you, sir, for no such man
<U+202D>  As fits these honourd strifes.  A number more
<U+202D>  Strange men there are that I would choose before.
<U+202D>  To one that loves to lie aship-board much,
<U+202D>  Or is the prince of sailors; or to such
<U+202D>  As traffic far and near, and nothing mind
<U+202D>  But freight, and passage, and a foreright wind;
<U+202D>  Or to a victualler of a ship; or men
<U+202D>  That set up all their powrs for rampant gain;
<U+202D>  I can compare, or hold you like to be:
<U+202D>  But, for a wrastler, or of quality
<U+202D>  Fit for contentions noble, you abhor
<U+202D>  From worth of any such competitor.
<U+202D>  Ulysses, frowning, answerd:  Stranger, far
<U+202D>  Thy words are from the fashions regular
<U+202D>  Of kind, or honour.  Thou art in thy guise
<U+202D>  Like to a man that authors injuries.  [4]
<U+202D>  I see, the Gods to all men give not all
<U+202D>  Manly addiction, wisdom, words that fall,
<U+202D>  Like dice, upon the square still.  Some man takes
<U+202D>  Ill form from parents, but God often makes
<U+202D>  That fault of form up with observd repair
<U+202D>  Of pleasing speech, that makes him held for fair,
<U+202D>  That makes him speak securely, makes him shine
<U+202D>  In an assembly with a grace divine.
<U+202D>  Men take delight to see how evnly lie
<U+202D>  His words asteep in honey modesty.
<U+202D>  Another, then, hath fashion like a God,
<U+202D>  But in his language he is foul and broad.
<U+202D>  And such art thou.  A person fair is givn,
<U+202D>  But nothing else is in thee sent from heavn;
<U+202D>  For in thee lurks a base and earthy soul,
<U+202D>  And t hast compelld me, with a speech most foul,
<U+202D>  To be thus bitter.  I am not unseen
<U+202D>  In these fair strifes, as thy words overween,
<U+202D>  But in the first rank of the best I stand;
<U+202D>  At least I did, when youth and strength of hand
<U+202D>  Made me thus confident, but now am worn
<U+202D>  With woes and labours, as a human born
<U+202D>  To bear all anguish.  Sufferd much I have.
<U+202D>  The war of men, and the inhuman wave,
<U+202D>  Have I drivn through at all parts.  But with all
<U+202D>  My waste in suffrance, what yet may fall
<U+202D>  In my performance, at these strifes Ill try.
<U+202D>  Thy speech hath movd, and made my wrath run high.
<U+202D>     This said, with robe and all, he graspd a stone,
<U+202D>  A little graver than was ever thrown
<U+202D>  By these Phaacians in their wrastling rout,
<U+202D>  More firm, more massy; which, turnd round about,
<U+202D>  He hurried from him with a hand so strong
<U+202D>  It sung, and flew, and over all the throng,
<U+202D>  That at the others marks stood, quite it went;
<U+202D>  Yet down fell all beneath it, fearing spent
<U+202D>  The force that drave it flying from his hand,
<U+202D>  As it a dart were, or a walking wand;
<U+202D>  And far past all the marks of all the rest
<U+202D>  His wing stole way; when Pallas straight imprest
<U+202D>  A mark at fall of it, resembling then
<U+202D>  One of the navy-givn Phaacian men,
<U+202D>  And thus advancd Ulysses:  One, though blind,
<U+202D>  O stranger, groping, may thy stones fall find,
<U+202D>  For not amidst the rout of marks it fell,
<U+202D>  But far before all.  Of thy worth think well,
<U+202D>  And stand in all strifes.  No Phaacian here
<U+202D>  This bound can either better or come near.
<U+202D>  Ulysses joyd to hear that one man yet
<U+202D>  Usd him benignly, and would truth abet
<U+202D>  In those contentions; and then thus smooth
<U+202D>  He took his speech down:  Reach me that now, youth,
<U+202D>  You shall, and straight I think, have one such more,
<U+202D>  And one beyond it too.  And now, whose core
<U+202D>  Stands sound and great within him, since ye have
<U+202D>  Thus put my spleen up, come again and brave
<U+202D>  The guest ye tempted, with such gross disgrace,
<U+202D>  At wrastling, buffets, whirlbat, speed o race;
<U+202D>  At all, or either, I except at none,
<U+202D>  But urge the whole state of you; only one,
<U+202D>  I will not challenge in my forced boast,
<U+202D>  And thats Laodamas, for hes mine host.  [5]
<U+202D>  And who will fight, or wrangle, with his friend?
<U+202D>  Unwise he is, and base, that will contend
<U+202D>  With him that feeds him in a foreign place;
<U+202D>  And takes all edge off from his own sought grace.
<U+202D>  None else except I here, nor none despise,
<U+202D>  But wish to know, and prove his faculties,
<U+202D>  That dares appear now.  No strife ye can name
<U+202D>  Am I unskilld in; reckon any game
<U+202D>  Of all that are, as many as there are
<U+202D>  In use with men.  For archery I dare
<U+202D>  Affirm myself not mean.  Of all a troop
<U+202D>  Ill make the first foe with mine arrow stoop,
<U+202D>  Though with me neer so many fellows bend
<U+202D>  Their bows at markd men, and affect their end.
<U+202D>  Only was Philoctetes with his bow
<U+202D>  Still my superior, when we Greeks would show
<U+202D>  Our archery against our foes of Troy.
<U+202D>  But all, that now by bread frail life enjoy,
<U+202D>  I far hold my inferiors.  Men of old,
<U+202D>  None now alive shall witness me so bold,
<U+202D>  To vaunt equality with, such men as these,
<U+202D>  Ochalián Eurytus, Hercules,
<U+202D>  Who with their bows durst with the Gods contend;
<U+202D>  And therefore caught Eurytus soon his end,
<U+202D>  Nor died at home, in age, a revrend man.
<U+202D>  But by the great incenséd Delphian
<U+202D>  Was shot to death, for daring competence
<U+202D>  With him in all an archers excellence.
<U+202D>  A spear Ill hurl as far as any man
<U+202D>  Shall shoot a shaft.  How at a race I can
<U+202D>  Bestir my feet, I only yield to fear,
<U+202D>  And doubt to meet with my superior here.
<U+202D>  So many seas so too much have misusd
<U+202D>  My limbs for race, and therefore have diffusd
<U+202D>  A dissolution through my lovéd knees.
<U+202D>     This said, he stilld all talking properties.
<U+202D>  Alcinous only answerd:  O my guest,
<U+202D>  In good part take we what you have been prest
<U+202D>  With speech to answer.  You would make appear
<U+202D>  Your virtues therefore, that will still shine where
<U+202D>  Your only look is.  Yet must this man give
<U+202D>  Your worth ill language; when, he does not live
<U+202D>  In sort of mortals (whencesoeer he springs,
<U+202D>  That judgment hath to speak becoming things)
<U+202D>  That will deprave your virtues.  Note then now
<U+202D>  My speech, and what my love presents to you,
<U+202D>  That you may tell heroës, when you come
<U+202D>  To banquet with your wife and birth at home,
<U+202D>  (Mindful of our worth) what deservings Jove
<U+202D>  Hath put on our parts likewise, in remove
<U+202D>  From sire to son, as an inherent grace
<U+202D>  Kind, and perpetual.  We must needs give place
<U+202D>  To other countrymen, and freely yield
<U+202D>  We are not blameless in our fights of field,
<U+202D>  Buffets, nor wrastlings; but in speed of feet,
<U+202D>  And all the equipage that fits a fleet,
<U+202D>  We boast us best; for table ever spread
<U+202D>  With neighbour feasts, for garments varied,
<U+202D>  For poesy, music, dancing, baths, and beds.
<U+202D>  And now, Phaacians, you that bear your heads
<U+202D>  And feet with best grace in enamouring dance,
<U+202D>  Enflame our guest here, that he may advance
<U+202D>  Our worth past all the worlds to his home-friends,
<U+202D>  As well for the unmatchd grace that commends.
<U+202D>  Your skill in footing of a dance, as theirs
<U+202D>  That fly a race best.  And so, all affairs,
<U+202D>  At which we boast us best, he best may try,
<U+202D>  As sea-race, land-race, dance, and poesy.
<U+202D>  Some one with instant speed to court retire,
<U+202D>  And fetch Demodocuss soundful lyre.
<U+202D>     This said the God-gracd king; and quick resort
<U+202D>  Pontonous made for that fair harp to court.
<U+202D>     Nine of the lot-choosd public rulers rose,
<U+202D>  That all in those contentions did dispose,
<U+202D>  Commanding a most smooth ground, and a wide,
<U+202D>  And all the people in fair game aside.
<U+202D>     Then with the rich harp came Pontonous,
<U+202D>  And in the midst took place Demodocus.
<U+202D>  About him then stood forth the choice young men,  [6]
<U+202D>  That on mans first youth made fresh entry then,
<U+202D>  Had art to make their natural motion sweet,
<U+202D>  And shook a most divine dance from their feet,
<U+202D>  That twinkled star-like, movd as swift, and fine,
<U+202D>  And beat the air so thin, they made it shine.
<U+202D>  Ulysses wonderd at it, but amazd
<U+202D>  He stood in mind to hear the dance so phrasd.
<U+202D>  For, as they dancd, Demodocus did sing,
<U+202D>  The bright-crownd Venus love with Battles King;
<U+202D>  As first they closely mixd in th house of fire.
<U+202D>  What worlds of gifts won her to his desire,
<U+202D>  Who then the night-and-day-bed did defile
<U+202D>  Of good king Vulcan.  But in little while
<U+202D>  The Sun their mixture saw, and came and told.
<U+202D>  The bitter news did by his ears take hold
<U+202D>  Of Vulcans heart.  Then to his forge he went,
<U+202D>  And in his shrewd mind deep stuff did invent.
<U+202D>  His mighty anvil in the stock he put,
<U+202D>  And forgd a net that none could loose or cut,
<U+202D>  That when it had them it might hold them fast.
<U+202D>  Which having finishd, he made utmost haste
<U+202D>  Up to the dear room where his wife he wood,
<U+202D>  And, madly wrath with Mars, he all bestrowd
<U+202D>  The bed, and bed-posts, all the beam above
<U+202D>  That crossd the chamber; and a circle strove
<U+202D>  Of his device to wrap in all the room.
<U+202D>  And twas as pure, as of a spiders loom
<U+202D>  The woof before tis wovn.  No man nor God
<U+202D>  Could set his eye on it, a sleight so odd
<U+202D>  His art showd in it.  All his craft bespent
<U+202D>  About the bed, he feignd as if he went
<U+202D>  To well-built Lemnos, his most lovéd town
<U+202D>  Of all towns earthly; nor left this unknown
<U+202D>  To golden-bridle-using Mars, who kept
<U+202D>  No blind watch over him, but, seeing stept
<U+202D>  His rival so aside, he hasted home
<U+202D>  With fair-wreathd Venus love stung, who was come
<U+202D>  New from the court of her most mighty Sire.
<U+202D>  Mars enterd, wrung her hand, and the retire
<U+202D>  Her husband made to Lemnos told, and said;
<U+202D>  Now, love, is Vulcan gone, let us to bed,
<U+202D>  Hes for the barbarous Sintians.  Well appayd
<U+202D>  Was Venus with it; and afresh assayd
<U+202D>  Their old encounter.  Down they went; and straight
<U+202D>  About them clingd the artificial sleight
<U+202D>  Of most wise Vulcan; and were so ensnard,
<U+202D>  That neither they could stir their course prepard
<U+202D>  In any limb about them, nor arise.
<U+202D>  And then they knew, they would no more disguise
<U+202D>  Their close conveyance, but lay, forcd, stone-still.
<U+202D>  Back rushd the both-foot-cookd, but straight in skill,
<U+202D>  From his near scout-hole turnd, nor ever went
<U+202D>  To any Lemnos, but the sure event
<U+202D>  Left Phobus to discover, who told all.
<U+202D>  Then home hoppd Vulcan, full of grief and gall,
<U+202D>  Stood in the portal, and cried out so high,
<U+202D>  That all the Gods heard;  Father of the sky,
<U+202D>  And evry other deathless God,  said he,
<U+202D>  Come all, and a ridiculous object see,
<U+202D>  And yet not sufferable neither.  Come,
<U+202D>  And witness how, when still I step from home,
<U+202D>  Lame that I am, Joves daughter doth profess
<U+202D>  To do me all the shameful offices,
<U+202D>  Indignities, despites, that can be thought;
<U+202D>  And loves this all-things-making-come-to-nought,
<U+202D>  Since he is fair forsooth, foot-sound, and I
<U+202D>  Took in my brain a little, leggd awry.
<U+202D>  And no fault mine, but all my parents fault,
<U+202D>  Who should not get, if mock me, with my halt.
<U+202D>  But see how fast they sleep, while I, in moan,
<U+202D>  Am only made an idle looker on.
<U+202D>  One bed their turn serves, and it must be mine;
<U+202D>  I think yet, I have made their self-loves shine.
<U+202D>  They shall no more wrong me, and none perceive;
<U+202D>  Nor will they sleep together, I believe,
<U+202D>  With too hot haste again.  Thus both shall lie
<U+202D>  In craft, and force, till the extremity
<U+202D>  Of all the dowr I gave her sire (to gain
<U+202D>  A doggéd set-facd girl, that will not stain
<U+202D>  Her face with blushing, though she shame her head)
<U+202D>  He pays me back.  Shes fair, but was no maid.
<U+202D>     While this long speech was making, all were come
<U+202D>  To Vulcans wholly-brazen-founded home,
<U+202D>  Earth-shaking Neptune, useful Mercury,
<U+202D>  And far-shot Phobus.  No She-Deity,
<U+202D>  For shame, would show there.  All the give-good Gods
<U+202D>  Stood in the portal, and past periods
<U+202D>  Gave length to laughters, all rejoicd to see
<U+202D>  That which they said, that no impiety
<U+202D>  Finds good success at th end.   And now,  said one,
<U+202D>  The slow outgoes the swift.  Lame Vulcan, known
<U+202D>  To be the slowest of the Gods, outgoes
<U+202D>  Mars the most swift.  And this is that which grows
<U+202D>  To greatest justice:  that adultrys sport,
<U+202D>  Obtaind by craft, by craft of other sort
<U+202D>  (And lame craft too) is plagued, which grieves the more,
<U+202D>  That sound limbs turning lame the lame restore.  [7]
<U+202D>     This speech amongst themselves they entertaind,
<U+202D>  When Phobus thus askd Hermes:  Thus enchaind
<U+202D>  Wouldst thou be, Hermes, to be thus disclosd?
<U+202D>  Though with thee golden Venus were reposd?
<U+202D>     He soon gave that an answer:  O,  said he,
<U+202D>  Thou king of archers, would twere thus with me!
<U+202D>  Though thrice so much shame; nay, though infinite
<U+202D>  Were pourd about me, and that evry light,
<U+202D>  In great heavn shining, witnessd all my harms,
<U+202D>  So golden Venus slumberd in mine arms.
<U+202D>     The Gods again laughd; even the Watery State
<U+202D>  Wrung out a laughter, but propitiate
<U+202D>  Was still for Mars, and prayd the God of Fire
<U+202D>  He would dissolve him, offring the desire
<U+202D>  He made to Jove to pay himself, and said,
<U+202D>  All due debts should be by the Gods repaid.
<U+202D>     Pay me, no words,  said he,  where deeds lend pain,
<U+202D>  Wretched the words are givn for wretched men.
<U+202D>  How shall I bind you in th Immortals sight,
<U+202D>  If Mars be once loosd, nor will pay his right?  [8]
<U+202D>     Vulcan,  said he,  if Mars should fly, nor see
<U+202D>  Thy right repaid, it should be paid by me.
<U+202D>     Your word, so givn, I must accept,  said he.
<U+202D>  Which said, he loosd them.  Mars then rushd from sky,
<U+202D>  And stoopd cold Thrace.  The laughing Deity
<U+202D>  For Cyprus was, and took her Paphian state,
<U+202D>  Where she a grove, neer cut, had consecrate,
<U+202D>  All with Arabian odours fumd, and hath
<U+202D>  An altar there, at which the Graces bathe,
<U+202D>  And with immortal balms besmooth, her skin,
<U+202D>  Fit for the bliss Immortals solace in;
<U+202D>  Deckd her in to-be-studiéd attire,
<U+202D>  And apt to set beholders hearts on fire.
<U+202D>     This sung the sacred muse, whose notes and words
<U+202D>  The dancers feet kept as his hands his chords.
<U+202D>  Ulysses much was pleasd, and all the crew.
<U+202D>     This would the king have varied with a new
<U+202D>  And pleasing measure, and performéd by
<U+202D>  Two, with whom none would strive in dancery;
<U+202D>  And those his sons were, that must therefore dance
<U+202D>  Alone, and only to the harp advance,
<U+202D>  Without the words.  And this sweet couple was
<U+202D>  Young Halius, and divine Laodamas;
<U+202D>  Who dancd a ball-dance.  Then the rich-wrought ball,
<U+202D>  That Polybus had made, of purple all,
<U+202D>  They took to hand.  One threw it to the sky,
<U+202D>  And then dancd back; the other, capering high,
<U+202D>  Would surely catch it ere his foot touchd ground,
<U+202D>  And up again advancd it, and so found
<U+202D>  The other cause of dance; and then did he
<U+202D>  Dance lofty tricks, till next it came to be
<U+202D>  His turn to catch, and serve the other still.
<U+202D>  When they had kept it up to eithers will,
<U+202D>  They then dancd ground tricks, oft mixd hand in hand,
<U+202D>  And did so gracefully their change command,
<U+202D>  That all the other youth that stood at pause,
<U+202D>  With deafning shouts, gave them the great applause.
<U+202D>     Then said Ulysses:  O, past all men here
<U+202D>  Clear, not in powr, but in desert as clear,
<U+202D>  You said your dancers did the world surpass,
<U+202D>  And they perform it clear, and to amaze.
<U+202D>     This won Alcinous heart, and equal prize
<U+202D>  He gave Ulysses, saying:  Matchless wise,
<U+202D>  Princes and rulers, I perceive our guest,
<U+202D>  And therefore let our hospitable best
<U+202D>  In fitting gifts be givn him:  Twelve chief kings
<U+202D>  There are that order all the glorious things
<U+202D>  Of this our kingdom; and, the thirteenth, I
<U+202D>  Exist, as crown to all.  Let instantly
<U+202D>  Be thirteen garments givn him, and of gold
<U+202D>  Precious, and fine, a talent.  While we hold
<U+202D>  This our assembly, be all fetchd, and givn,
<U+202D>  That to our feast prepard, as to his heavn,
<U+202D>  Our guest may enter.  And, that nothing be
<U+202D>  Left unperformd that fits his dignity,
<U+202D>  Euryalus shall here conciliate
<U+202D>  Himself with words and gifts, since past our rate
<U+202D>  He gave bad language.  This did all commend
<U+202D>  And give in charge; and evry king did send
<U+202D>  His herald for his gift.  Euryalus,
<U+202D>  Answring for his part, said:  Alcinous!
<U+202D>  Our chief of all, since you command, I will
<U+202D>  To this our guest by all means reconcile,
<U+202D>  And give him this entirely-metalld sword,
<U+202D>  The handle massy silver, and the board,
<U+202D>  That gives it cover, all of ivory,
<U+202D>  New, and in all kinds worth his quality.
<U+202D>     This put he straight into his hand, and said:
<U+202D>  Frolic, O guest and father; if words fled
<U+202D>  Have been offensive, let swift whirlwinds take
<U+202D>  And ravish them from thought.  May all Gods make
<U+202D>  Thy wifes sight good to thee, in quick retreat
<U+202D>  To all thy friends, and best-lovd breeding seat,
<U+202D>  Their long miss quitting with the greater joy;
<U+202D>  In whose sweet vanish all thy worst annoy.
<U+202D>     And frolic thou to all height, friend,  said he,
<U+202D>  Which heavn confirm with wishd felicity;
<U+202D>  Nor ever give again desire to thee
<U+202D>  Of this swords use, which with affects so free,
<U+202D>  In my reclaim, thou hast bestowd on me.
<U+202D>     This said, athwart his shoulders he put on
<U+202D>  The right fair sword; and then did set the sun.
<U+202D>  When all the gifts were brought, which back again
<U+202D>  (With king Alcinous in all the train)
<U+202D>  Were by the honourd heralds borne to court;
<U+202D>  Which his fair sons took, and from the resort
<U+202D>  Laid by their revrend mother.  Each his throne
<U+202D>  Of all the peers (which yet were overshone
<U+202D>  In king Alcinous command) ascended;
<U+202D>  Whom he to pass as much in gifts contended,
<U+202D>  And to his queen said:  Wife!  See brought me here
<U+202D>  The fairest cabinet I have, and there
<U+202D>  Impose a well-cleansd in, and utter, weed.
<U+202D>  A caldron heat with water, that with speed
<U+202D>  Our guest well-bathd, and all his gifts made sure,
<U+202D>  It may a joyful appetite procure
<U+202D>  To his succeeding feast, and make him hear
<U+202D>  The poets hymn with the securer ear.
<U+202D>  To all which I will add my bowl of gold,
<U+202D>  In all frame curious, to make him hold
<U+202D>  My memory always dear, and sacrifice
<U+202D>  With it at home to all the Deities.
<U+202D>     Then Arete her maids chargd to set on
<U+202D>  A well-sizd caldron quickly.  Which was done,
<U+202D>  Clear water pourd in, flame made so entire,
<U+202D>  It gilt the brass, and made the water fire.
<U+202D>  In mean space, from her chamber brought the queen
<U+202D>  A wealthy cabinet, where, pure and clean,
<U+202D>  She put the garments, and the gold bestowd
<U+202D>  By that free state, and then the other vowd
<U+202D>  By her Alcinous, and said:  Now, guest,
<U+202D>  Make close and fast your gifts, lest, when you rest
<U+202D>  Aship-board sweetly, in your way you meet
<U+202D>  Some loss, that less may make your next sleep sweet.
<U+202D>     This when Ulysses heard, all sure he made
<U+202D>  Enclosd and bound safe; for the saving trade
<U+202D>  The revrend-for-her-wisdom, Circe, had
<U+202D>  In foreyears taught him.  Then the handmaid bad
<U+202D>  His worth to bathing; which rejoicd his heart,
<U+202D>  For, since he did with his Calypso part,
<U+202D>  He had no hot baths; none had favourd him,
<U+202D>  Nor been so tender of his kingly limb.
<U+202D>  But all the time he spent in her abode,
<U+202D>  He livd respected as he were a God.
<U+202D>     Cleansd then and balmd, fair shirt and robe put on,
<U+202D>  Fresh come from bath, and to the feasters gone,
<U+202D>  Nausicaa, that from the Gods hands took
<U+202D>  The sovreign beauty of her blessed look,
<U+202D>  Stood by a well-carvd column of the room,
<U+202D>  And through her eye her heart was overcome
<U+202D>  With admiration of the port imprest
<U+202D>  In his aspéct, and said:  God save you, guest!
<U+202D>  Be cheerful, as in all the future state
<U+202D>  Your home will show you in your better fate.
<U+202D>  But yet, evn then, let this rememberd be,
<U+202D>  Your lifes price I lent, and you owe it me.
<U+202D>     The varied-in-all-counsels gave reply:
<U+202D>  Nausicaa!  Flowr of all this empery!
<U+202D>  So Junos husband, that the strife for noise
<U+202D>  Makes in the clouds, bless me with strife of joys,
<U+202D>  In the desird day that my house shall show,
<U+202D>  As I, as I to a Goddess there shall vow,
<U+202D>  To thy fair hand that did my being give,
<U+202D>  Which Ill acknowledge evry hour I live.
<U+202D>     This said, Alcinous placd him by his side.
<U+202D>  Then took they feast, and did in parts divide
<U+202D>  The sevral dishes, filld out wine, and then
<U+202D>  The strivd-for-for-his-worth of worthy men,  [9]
<U+202D>  And revrencd-of-the-state, Demodocus
<U+202D>  Was brought in by the good Pontonous.
<U+202D>  In midst of all the guests they gave him place,
<U+202D>  Against a lofty pillar, when this grace
<U+202D>  The gracd-with-wisdom did him:  From the chine,
<U+202D>  That stood before him, of a white-toothd swine,
<U+202D>  Being far the daintiest joint, mixd through with fat,
<U+202D>  He carvd to him, and sent it where he sat
<U+202D>  By his old friend the herald, willing thus:
<U+202D>  Herald, reach this to grave Demodocus,
<U+202D>  Say, I salute him, and his worth embrace.
<U+202D>  Poets deserve, past all the human race,
<U+202D>  Revrend respect and honour, since the queen
<U+202D>  Of knowledge, and the supreme worth in men,
<U+202D>  The Muse, informs them, and loves all their race.
<U+202D>     This reachd the herald to him, who the grace
<U+202D>  Receivd encouragd; which, when feast was spent,
<U+202D>  Ulysses amplified to this ascent:
<U+202D>     Demodocus!  I must prefer you far,
<U+202D>  Past all your sort, if, or the Muse of war,
<U+202D>  Joves daughter, prompts you, that the Greeks respects,
<U+202D>  Or if the Sun, that those of Troy affects.
<U+202D>  For I have heard you, since my coming, sing
<U+202D>  The fate of Greece to an admiréd string.
<U+202D>  How much our suffrance was, how much we wrought,
<U+202D>  How much the actions rose-to when we fought.
<U+202D>  So lively forming, as you had been there,
<U+202D>  Or to some free relater lent your ear.
<U+202D>  Forth then, and sing the wooden horses frame,
<U+202D>  Built by Epëus, by the martial Dame
<U+202D>  Taught the whole fabric; which, by force of sleight,
<U+202D>  Ulysses brought into the citys height,
<U+202D>  When he had stuffd it with as many men
<U+202D>  As levelld lofty Ilion with the plain.
<U+202D>  With all which if you can as well enchant,
<U+202D>  As with expression quick and elegant
<U+202D>  You sung the rest, I will pronounce you clear
<U+202D>  Inspird by God, past all that ever were.
<U+202D>     This said, evn stirrd by God up, he began,
<U+202D>  And to his song fell, past the forms of man,
<U+202D>  Beginning where the Greeks aship-board went,
<U+202D>  And evry chief had set on fire his tent,
<U+202D>  When th other kings, in great Ulysses guide,
<U+202D>  In Troys vast market place the horse did hide,
<U+202D>  From whence the Trojans up to Ilion drew
<U+202D>  The dreadful engine.  Where sat all arew
<U+202D>  Their kings about it; many counsels givn
<U+202D>  How to dispose it.  In three ways were drivn
<U+202D>  Their whole distractions.  First, if they should feel
<U+202D>  The hollow woods heart, searchd with piercing steel;
<U+202D>  Or from the battlements drawn higher yet
<U+202D>  Deject it headlong; or that counterfeit
<U+202D>  So vast and novel set on sacred fire,
<U+202D>  Vowd to appease each angerd Godheads ire.
<U+202D>  On which opinion, they, thereafter, saw,
<U+202D>  They then should have resolvd; th unalterd law
<U+202D>  Of fate presaging, that Troy then should end,
<U+202D>  When th hostile horse she should receive to friend,
<U+202D>  For therein should the Grecian kings lie hid,
<U+202D>  To bring the fate and death they after did.
<U+202D>     He sung, besides, the Greeks eruptión
<U+202D>  From those their hollow crafts, and horse foregone;
<U+202D>  And how they made depopulation tread
<U+202D>  Beneath her feet so high a citys head.
<U+202D>  In which affair, he sung in other place,
<U+202D>  That of that ambush some man else did race
<U+202D>  The Ilion towrs than Laertiades;
<U+202D>  But here he sung, that he alone did seize,  [10]
<U+202D>  With Menelaus, the ascended roof
<U+202D>  Of prince Deiphobus, and Mars-like proof
<U+202D>  Made of his valour, a most dreadful fight
<U+202D>  Daring against him; and there vanquishd quite,
<U+202D>  In little time, by great Minervas aid,
<U+202D>  All Ilions remnant, and Troy level laid.
<U+202D>  This the divine expressor did so give
<U+202D>  Both act and passion, that he made it live,
<U+202D>  And to Ulysses facts did breathe a fire
<U+202D>  So deadly quickning, that it did inspire  [11]
<U+202D>  Old death with life, and renderd life so sweet,
<U+202D>  And passionate, that all there felt it fleet;
<U+202D>  Which made him pity his own cruelty,
<U+202D>  And put into that ruth so pure an eye
<U+202D>  Of human frailty, that to see a man
<U+202D>  Could so revive from death, yet no way can
<U+202D>  Defend from death, his own quick powrs it made
<U+202D>  Feel there deaths horrors, and he felt life fade,
<U+202D>  In tears his feeling brain swet; for, in things  [12]
<U+202D>  That move past uttrance, tears ope all their springs.
<U+202D>  Nor are there in the powrs that all life bears
<U+202D>  More true interpreters of all than tears.
<U+202D>     And as a lady mourns her sole-lovd lord,
<U+202D>  That falln before his city by the sword,
<U+202D>  Fighting to rescue from a cruel fate
<U+202D>  His town and children, and in dead estate
<U+202D>  Yet panting seeing him, wraps him in her arms,
<U+202D>  Weeps, shrieks, and pours her health into his arms,
<U+202D>  Lies on him, striving to become his shield
<U+202D>  From foes that still assail him, spears impelld
<U+202D>  Through back and shoulders, by whose points embrued,
<U+202D>  They raise and lead him into servitude,
<U+202D>  Labour, and languor; for all which the dame
<U+202D>  Eats down her cheeks with tears, and feeds lifes flame
<U+202D>  With miserable suffrance; so this king
<U+202D>  Of tear-swet anguish opd a boundless spring;
<U+202D>  Nor yet was seen to any one man there
<U+202D>  But king Alcinous, who sat so near
<U+202D>  He could not scape him, sighs, so chokd, so brake
<U+202D>  From all his tempers; which the king did take
<U+202D>  Both note and grave respect of, and thus spake:
<U+202D>  Hear me, Phaacian councillors and peers,
<U+202D>  And cease Demodocus; perhaps all ears
<U+202D>  Are not delighted with his song, for, ever
<U+202D>  Since the divine Muse sung, our guest hath never
<U+202D>  Containd from secret mournings.  It may fall,
<U+202D>  That something sung he hath been grieved with all,
<U+202D>  As touching his particular.  Forbear,
<U+202D>  That feast may jointly comfort all hearts here,
<U+202D>  And we may cheer our guest up; tis our best
<U+202D>  In all due honour.  For our revrend guest
<U+202D>  Is all our celebration, gifts, and all,
<U+202D>  His love hath added to our festival.
<U+202D>  A guest, and suppliant too, we should esteem
<U+202D>  Dear as our brother, one that doth but dream
<U+202D>  He hath a soul, or touch but at a mind
<U+202D>  Deathless and manly, should stand so inclind.
<U+202D>  Nor cloak you longer with your curious wit,
<U+202D>  Lovd guest, what ever we shall ask of it.
<U+202D>  It now stands on your honest state to tell,
<U+202D>  And therefore give your name, nor more conceal
<U+202D>  What of your parents, and the town that bears
<U+202D>  Name of your native, or of foreigners
<U+202D>  That near us border, you are calld in fame.
<U+202D>  Theres no man living walks without a name,
<U+202D>  Noble nor base, but had one from his birth
<U+202D>  Imposd as fit as to be borne.  What earth,
<U+202D>  People, and city, own you, give to know.
<U+202D>  Tell but our ships all, that your way must show.
<U+202D>  For our ships know th expressed minds of men,
<U+202D>  And will so most intentively retain
<U+202D>  Their scopes appointed, that they never err,
<U+202D>  And yet use never any man to steer,
<U+202D>  Nor any rudders have, as others need.
<U+202D>  They know mens thoughts, and whither tends their speed,
<U+202D>  And there will set them; for you cannot name  [13]
<U+202D>  A city to them, nor fat soil, that Fame
<U+202D>  Hath any notice givn, but well they know,
<U+202D>  And they will fly to them, though they ebb and flow
<U+202D>  In blackest clouds and nights; and never bear
<U+202D>  Of any wrack or rock the slendrest fear.
<U+202D>  But this I heard my sire Nausithous say.
<U+202D>  Long since, that Neptune, seeing us convey
<U+202D>  So safely passengers of all degrees,
<U+202D>  Was angry with us; and upon our seas
<U+202D>  A well-built ship we had, near harbour come
<U+202D>  From safe deduction of some stranger home,
<U+202D>  Made in his flitting billows stick stone still;
<U+202D>  And dimmd our city, like a mighty hill
<U+202D>  With shade cast round about it.  This report,
<U+202D>  The old king made;  [14]  in which miraculous sort,
<U+202D>  If God had done such things, or left undone,
<U+202D>  At his good pleasure be it.  But now, on,
<U+202D>  And truth relate us, both whence you errd,
<U+202D>  And to what clime of men would be transferrd,
<U+202D>  With all their fair towns, be they as they are,
<U+202D>  If rude, unjust, and all irregular,
<U+202D>  Or hospitable, bearing minds that please
<U+202D>  The mighty Deity.  Which one of these
<U+202D>  You would be set at, say, and you are there.
<U+202D>  And therefore what afflicts you?  Why, to hear
<U+202D>  The fate of Greece and Ilion, mourn you so?
<U+202D>  The Gods have done it; as to all they do
<U+202D>  Destine destruction, that from thence may rise
<U+202D>  A poem to instruct posterities.
<U+202D>  Fell any kinsman before Ilion?
<U+202D>  Some worthy sire-in-law, or like-near son,
<U+202D>  Whom next our own blood and self-race we love?
<U+202D>  Or any friend perhaps, in whom did move
<U+202D>  A knowing soul, and no unpleasing thing?
<U+202D>  Since such a good one is no underling
<U+202D>  To any brother; for, what fits true friends,
<U+202D>  True wisdom is, that blood and birth transcends.
