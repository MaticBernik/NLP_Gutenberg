SCENE IV. _A room in DOCTOR CAIUS'S house._
  _Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY, SIMPLE, and RUGBY._
_Quick._ What, John Rugby! I pray thee, go to the
casement, and see if you can see my master, Master
Doctor Caius, coming. If he do, i' faith, and find any
body in the house, here will be an old abusing of God's
patience and the king's English.                                     5
_Rug._ I'll go watch.
_Quick._ Go; and we'll have a posset for't soon at night,
in faith, at the latter end of a sea-coal fire. [_Exit Rugby._]
An honest, willing, kind fellow, as ever servant shall come
in house withal; and, I warrant you, no tell-tale nor no            10
breed-bate: his worst fault is, that he is given to prayer; he is
something peevish that way: but nobody but has his fault;
but let that pass. Peter Simple, you say your name is?
_Sim._ Ay, for fault of a better.
_Quick._ And Master Slender's your master?                          15
_Sim._ Ay, forsooth.
_Quick._ Does he not wear a great round beard, like a
glover's paring-knife?
_Sim._ No, forsooth: he hath but a little wee face, with
a little yellow beard,--a Cain-coloured beard.                      20
_Quick._ A softly-sprighted man, is he not?
_Sim._ Ay, forsooth: but he is as tall a man of his
hands as any is between this and his head; he hath fought
with a warrener.
_Quick._ How say you?--O, I should remember him:                    25
does he not hold up his head, as it were, and strut in his gait?
_Sim._ Yes, indeed, does he.
_Quick._ Well, heaven send Anne Page no worse fortune!
Tell Master Parson Evans I will do what I can
for your master: Anne is a good girl, and I wish--                  30
  _Re-enter RUGBY._
_Rug._ Out, alas! here comes my master.
_Quick._ We shall all be shent. Run in here, good
young man; go into this closet: he will not stay long.
[_Shuts Simple in the closet._] What, John Rugby! John!
what, John, I say! Go, John, go inquire for my master;              35
I doubt he be not well, that he comes not home.
[_Singing_] And down, down, adown-a, &c.
  _Enter DOCTOR CAIUS._
_Caius._ Vat is you sing? I do not like des toys. Pray
you, go and vetch me in my closet un boitier vert,--a box,
a green-a box: do intend vat I speak? a green-a box.                40
_Quick._ Ay, forsooth; I'll fetch it you. [_Aside_] I am
glad he went not in himself: if he had found the young
man, he would have been horn-mad.
_Caius._ Fe, fe, fe, fe! ma foi, il fait fort chaud. Je
m'en vais a la cour,--la grande affaire.                            45
_Quick._ Is it this, sir?
_Caius._ Oui; mette le au mon pocket: depeche, quickly.
Vere is dat knave Rugby?
_Quick._ What, John Rugby! John!
_Rug._ Here, sir!                                                   50
_Caius._ You are John Rugby, and you are Jack Rugby.
Come, take-a your rapier, and come after my heel to the
court.
_Rug._ 'Tis ready, sir, here in the porch.
