ALCIBIADES.
My lord,--
FIRST SENATOR.
You cannot make gross sins look clear;
To revenge is no valour, but to bear.
ALCIBIADES.
My lords, then, under favour, pardon me,
If I speak like a captain.
Why do fond men expose themselves to battle,
And not endure all threats? sleep upon't,
And let the foes quietly cut their throats
Without repugnancy? If there be
Such valour in the bearing, what make we
Abroad? why, then, women are more valiant
That stay at home, if bearing carry it,
And the ass more captain than the lion, the felon
Loaden with irons wiser than the judge,
If wisdom be in suffering. O my lords!
As you are great, be pitifully good:
Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood?
To kill, I grant, is sin's extremest gust;
But, in defence, by mercy, 'tis most just.
To be in anger is impiety;
But who is man that is not angry?
Weigh but the crime with this.
SECOND SENATOR.
You breathe in vain.
ALCIBIADES.
In vain! his service done
At Lacedaemon and Byzantium
Were a sufficient briber for his life.
FIRST SENATOR.
What's that?
ALCIBIADES.
I say, my lords, has done fair service,
And slain in fight many of your enemies.
How full of valour did he bear himself
In the last conflict, and made plenteous wounds!
SECOND SENATOR.
He has made too much plenty with 'em;
He's a sworn rioter; he has a sin that often
Drowns him and takes his valour prisoner;
If there were no foes, that were enough
To overcome him; in that beastly fury
He has been known to commit outrages
And cherish factions; 'tis inferr'd to us,
His days are foul and his drink dangerous.
FIRST SENATOR.
He dies.
ALCIBIADES.
Hard fate! he might have died in war.
My lords, if not for any parts in him,--
Though his right arm might purchase his own time,
And be in debt to none,--yet, more to move you,
Take my deserts to his, and join 'em both;
And, for I know your reverend ages love
Security, I'll pawn my victories, all
My honour to you, upon his good returns.
If by this crime he owes the law his life,
Why, let the war receive't in valiant gore;
For law is strict, and war is nothing more.
FIRST SENATOR.
We are for law; he dies: urge it no more,
On height of our displeasure. Friend or brother,
He forfeits his own blood that spills another.
ALCIBIADES.
Must it be so? it must not be. My lords,
I do beseech you, know me.
SECOND SENATOR.
How!
ALCIBIADES.
Call me to your remembrances.
THIRD SENATOR.
What!
ALCIBIADES.
I cannot think but your age has forgot me;
It could not else be I should prove so base,
To sue, and be denied such common grace.
My wounds ache at you.
FIRST SENATOR.
Do you dare our anger?
'Tis in few words, but spacious in effect;
We banish thee for ever.
ALCIBIADES.
Banish me!
Banish your dotage; banish usury,
That makes the Senate ugly.
