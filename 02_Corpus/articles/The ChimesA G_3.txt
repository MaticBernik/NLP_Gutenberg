Youre always a-being begged, and prayed, upon your bended knees you
are, said the footman with great emphasis to Trotty Veck, to let our
door-steps be.  Why dont you let em be?  CANT you let em be?
There!  Thatll do, thatll do! said the gentleman.  Halloa there!
Porter! beckoning with his head to Trotty Veck.  Come here.  Whats
that?  Your dinner?
Yes, sir, said Trotty, leaving it behind him in a corner.
Dont leave it there, exclaimed the gentleman.  Bring it here, bring
it here.  So!  This is your dinner, is it?
Yes, sir, repeated Trotty, looking with a fixed eye and a watery mouth,
at the piece of tripe he had reserved for a last delicious tit-bit; which
the gentleman was now turning over and over on the end of the fork.
Two other gentlemen had come out with him.  One was a low-spirited
gentleman of middle age, of a meagre habit, and a disconsolate face; who
kept his hands continually in the pockets of his scanty pepper-and-salt
trousers, very large and dogs-eared from that custom; and was not
particularly well brushed or washed.  The other, a full-sized, sleek,
well-conditioned gentleman, in a blue coat with bright buttons, and a
white cravat.  This gentleman had a very red face, as if an undue
proportion of the blood in his body were squeezed up into his head; which
perhaps accounted for his having also the appearance of being rather cold
about the heart.
He who had Tobys meat upon the fork, called to the first one by the name
of Filer; and they both drew near together.  Mr. Filer being exceedingly
short-sighted, was obliged to go so close to the remnant of Tobys dinner
before he could make out what it was, that Tobys heart leaped up into
his mouth.  But Mr. Filer didnt eat it.
This is a description of animal food, Alderman, said Filer, making
little punches in it with a pencil-case, commonly known to the labouring
population of this country, by the name of tripe.
The Alderman laughed, and winked; for he was a merry fellow, Alderman
Cute.  Oh, and a sly fellow too!  A knowing fellow.  Up to everything.
Not to be imposed upon.  Deep in the peoples hearts!  He knew them, Cute
did.  I believe you!
But who eats tripe? said Mr. Filer, looking round.  Tripe is without
an exception the least economical, and the most wasteful article of
consumption that the markets of this country can by possibility produce.
The loss upon a pound of tripe has been found to be, in the boiling,
seven-eights of a fifth more than the loss upon a pound of any other
animal substance whatever.  Tripe is more expensive, properly understood,
than the hothouse pine-apple.  Taking into account the number of animals
slaughtered yearly within the bills of mortality alone; and forming a low
estimate of the quantity of tripe which the carcases of those animals,
reasonably well butchered, would yield; I find that the waste on that
amount of tripe, if boiled, would victual a garrison of five hundred men
for five months of thirty-one days each, and a February over.  The Waste,
the Waste!
