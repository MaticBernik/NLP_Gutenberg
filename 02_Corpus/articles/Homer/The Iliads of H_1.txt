For avoiding the common reader's trouble here, I must refer the more
Greekish to the rest of the speech in Homer, whose translation _ad
verbum_ by Spondanus I will here cite, and then pray you to confer it
with that which followeth of Valla.
  _Quoniam vero nunc Alexandrum Menelaus
  Postquam vicit, vult odiosam me domum abducere,
  Propterea vero nunc dolum (seu dolos) cogitans advenisti?
  Sede apud ipsum vadens, deorum abnega vias,
  Neque unquam tuis pedibus revertaris in colum,
  Sed semper circa eum arumnas perfer, et ipsum serva
  Donec te vel uxorem faciat, vel hic servam,_ etc.
Valla thus:
  _Quoniam victo Paride, Menelaus me miseram est reportaturus ad
  lares, ideo tu, ideo fals√¢ sub imagine venisti, ut me deciperes ob
  tuam nimiam in Paridem benevolentiam: eo dum illi ades, dum illi
  studes, dum pro illo satagis, dum illum observas atque custodis,
  deorum commercium reliquisti, nec ad eos reversura es amplius: adeo
  (quantum suspicor) aut uxor ejus efficieris, aut ancilla,_ etc.
Wherein note if there be any such thing as most of this in Homer; yet
only to express, as he thinks, Homer's conceit, for the more pleasure
of the reader, he useth this overplus, _dum illi ades, dum illi
studes, dum pro illo satagis, dum ilium observas, atque custodis,
deorum commercium reliquisti._ Which (besides his superfluity) is
utterly false. For where he saith _reliquisti deorum commercium_,
Helen saith, _<U+03B8><U+03B5><U+03C9><U+0311><U+03BD> <U+03B4><U+1FBD><U+1F00><U+03C0><U+1F79><U+03B5><U+03B9><U+03C0><U+03B5> <U+03BA><U+03B5><U+03BB><U+03B5><U+1F7B><U+03B8><U+03BF><U+03C5><U+03C2>, deorum auten abnega_ or
_abnue, vias, <U+1F00><U+03C0><U+03B5><U+1F77><U+03C0><U+03B5><U+03B9><U+03BD> (vel <U+1F00><U+03C0><U+03BF><U+03B5><U+1F77><U+03C0><U+03B5><U+03B9><U+03BD>_ as it is used poetically)
signifying _denegare_ or _aonuere_; and Helen (in contempt of her too
much observing men) bids her renounce heaven, and come live with
Paris till he make her his wife or servant; scoptically or scornfully
speaking it; which both Valla, Eobanus, and all other interpreters
(but these _ad verbum_) have utterly missed. And this one example I
thought necessary to insert here, to show my detractors that they
have no reason to vilify my circumlocution sometimes, when their most
approved Grecians, Homer's interpreters generally, hold him fit to be
so converted. Yet how much I differ, and with what authority, let my
impartial and judicial reader judge. Always conceiving how pedantical
and absurd an affectation it is in the interpretation of any author
(much more of Homer) to turn him word for word, when according to
Horace and other best lawgivers to translators) it is the part of
every knowing and judicial interpreter, not to follow the number and
order of words, but the material things themselves, and sentences to
weigh diligently, and to clothe and adorn them with words, and such a
style and form of oration, as are most apt for the language in which
they are converted. If I have not turned him ill any place falsely
(as all other his interpreters have in many, and most of his chief
places) if I have not left behind me any of his sentences, elegancy,
height, intention, and invention, if in some few places (especially
in my first edition, being done so long since, and following the
common tract) I be something paraphrastical and faulty, is it justice
in that poor fault (if they will needs have it so) to drown all the
rest of my labour? But there is a certain envious windsucker, that
hovers up and down, laboriously engrossing all the air with his
luxurious ambition, and buzzing into every ear my detraction,
affirming I turn Homer out of the Latin only, etc. that sets all his
associates, and the whole rabble of my maligners on their wings with
him, to bear about my impair, and poison my reputation. One that, as
he thinks, whatsoever he gives to others, he takes from himself; so
whatsoever he takes from others, he adds to himself. One that in this
kind of robbery doth like Mercury, that stole good and supplied it
with counterfeit bad still. One like the two gluttons, Philoxenus and
Gnatho, that would still empty their noses in the dishes they loved,
that no man might eat but themselves. For so this castrill, with too
hot a liver, and lust after his own glory, and to devour all himself,
discourageth all appetites to the fame of another. I have stricken,
single him as you can. Nor note I this, to cast any rubs or plashes
out of the particular way of mine own estimation with the world; for
I resolve this with the wilfully obscure:
