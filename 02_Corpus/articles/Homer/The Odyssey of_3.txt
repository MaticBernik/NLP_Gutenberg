BOOK V
ARGUMENT
Mercury bears to Calypso a command from Jupiter that she dismiss Ulysses.
She, after some remonstrances, promises obedience, and furnishes him with
instruments and materials, with which he constructs a raft. He quits
Calypso's island; is persecuted by Neptune with dreadful tempests, but by
the assistance of a sea nymph, after having lost his raft, is enabled to
swim to Phaeacia.
    Aurora from beside her glorious mate
    Tithonus now arose, light to dispense
    Through earth and heav'n, when the assembled Gods
    In council sat, o'er whom high-thund'ring Jove
    Presided, mightiest of the Pow'rs above.
    Amid them, Pallas on the num'rous woes
    Descanted of Ulysses, whom she saw
    With grief, still prison'd in Calypso's isle.
      Jove, Father, hear me, and ye other Pow'rs
    Who live for ever, hear! Be never King                            10
    Henceforth to gracious acts inclined, humane,
    Or righteous, but let ev'ry sceptred hand
    Rule merciless, and deal in wrong alone,
    Since none of all his people whom he sway'd
    With such paternal gentleness and love
    Remembers, now, divine Ulysses more.
    He, in yon distant isle a suff'rer lies
    Of hopeless sorrow, through constraint the guest
    Still of the nymph Calypso, without means
    Or pow'r to reach his native shores again,                        20
    Alike of gallant barks and friends depriv'd,
    Who might conduct him o'er the spacious Deep.
    Nor is this all, but enemies combine
    To slay his son ere yet he can return
    From Pylus, whither he hath gone to learn
    There, or in Sparta, tidings of his Sire.
      To whom the cloud-assembler God replied.
    What word hath pass'd thy lips, daughter belov'd?
    Hast thou not purpos'd that arriving soon
    At home, Ulysses shall destroy his foes?                          30
    Guide thou, Telemachus, (for well thou canst)
    That he may reach secure his native coast,
    And that the suitors baffled may return.
      He ceas'd, and thus to Hermes spake, his son.
    Hermes! (for thou art herald of our will
    At all times) to yon bright-hair'd nymph convey
    Our fix'd resolve, that brave Ulysses thence
    Depart, uncompanied by God or man.
    Borne on a corded raft, and suff'ring woe
    Extreme, he on the twentieth day shall reach,                     40
    Not sooner, Scherie the deep-soil'd, possess'd
    By the Phaeacians, kinsmen of the Gods.
    They, as a God shall reverence the Chief,
    And in a bark of theirs shall send him thence
    To his own home, much treasure, brass and gold
    And raiment giving him, to an amount
    Surpassing all that, had he safe return'd,
    He should by lot have shared of Ilium's spoil.
    Thus Fate appoints Ulysses to regain
    His country, his own palace, and his friends.                     50
      He ended, nor the Argicide refused,
    Messenger of the skies; his sandals fair,
    Ambrosial, golden, to his feet he bound,
    Which o'er the moist wave, rapid as the wind,
    Bear him, and o'er th' illimitable earth,
    Then took his rod with which, at will, all eyes
    He closes soft, or opes them wide again.
    So arm'd, forth flew the valiant Argicide.
    Alighting on Pieria, down he stoop'd
    To Ocean, and the billows lightly skimm'd                         60
    In form a sew-mew, such as in the bays
    Tremendous of the barren Deep her food
    Seeking, dips oft in brine her ample wing.
    In such disguise o'er many a wave he rode,
    But reaching, now, that isle remote, forsook
    The azure Deep, and at the spacious grot,
    Where dwelt the amber-tressed nymph arrived,
    Found her within. A fire on all the hearth
    Blazed sprightly, and, afar-diffused, the scent
    Of smooth-split cedar and of cypress-wood                         70
    Odorous, burning, cheer'd the happy isle.
    She, busied at the loom, and plying fast
    Her golden shuttle, with melodious voice
    Sat chaunting there; a grove on either side,
    Alder and poplar, and the redolent branch
    Wide-spread of Cypress, skirted dark the cave.
    There many a bird of broadest pinion built
    Secure her nest, the owl, the kite, and daw
    Long-tongued, frequenter of the sandy shores.
    A garden-vine luxuriant on all sides                              80
    Mantled the spacious cavern, cluster-hung
    Profuse; four fountains of serenest lymph
    Their sinuous course pursuing side by side,
    Stray'd all around, and ev'ry where appear'd
    Meadows of softest verdure, purpled o'er
    With violets; it was a scene to fill
    A God from heav'n with wonder and delight.
    Hermes, Heav'n's messenger, admiring stood
    That sight, and having all survey'd, at length
    Enter'd the grotto; nor the lovely nymph                          90
    Him knew not soon as seen, for not unknown
    Each to the other the Immortals are,
    How far soever sep'rate their abodes.
    Yet found he not within the mighty Chief
    Ulysses; he sat weeping on the shore,
    Forlorn, for there his custom was with groans
    Of sad regret t' afflict his breaking heart.
    Looking continual o'er the barren Deep.
    Then thus Calypso, nymph divine, the God
    Question'd, from her resplendent throne august.                  100
      Hermes! possessor of the potent rod!
    Who, though by me much reverenc'd and belov'd,
    So seldom com'st, say, wherefore comest now?
    Speak thy desire; I grant it, if thou ask
    Things possible, and possible to me.
    Stay not, but ent'ring farther, at my board
    Due rites of hospitality receive.
      So saying, the Goddess with ambrosial food
    Her table cover'd, and with rosy juice
    Nectareous charged the cup. Then ate and drank                   110
    The argicide and herald of the skies,
    And in his soul with that repast divine
    Refresh'd, his message to the nymph declared.
      Questionest thou, O Goddess, me a God?
    I tell thee truth, since such is thy demand.
    Not willing, but by Jove constrain'd, I come.
    For who would, voluntary, such a breadth
    Enormous measure of the salt expanse,
    Where city none is seen in which the Gods
    Are served with chosen hecatombs and pray'r?                     120
    But no divinity may the designs
    Elude, or controvert, of Jove supreme.
    He saith, that here thou hold'st the most distrest
    Of all those warriors who nine years assail'd
    The city of Priam, and, (that city sack'd)
    Departed in the tenth; but, going thence,
    Offended Pallas, who with adverse winds
    Opposed their voyage, and with boist'rous waves.
    Then perish'd all his gallant friends, but him
    Billows and storms drove hither; Jove commands                   130
    That thou dismiss him hence without delay,
    For fate ordains him not to perish here
    From all his friends remote, but he is doom'd
    To see them yet again, and to arrive
    At his own palace in his native land.
      He said; divine Calypso at the sound
    Shudder'd, and in wing'd accents thus replied.
      Ye are unjust, ye Gods, and envious past
    All others, grudging if a Goddess take
    A mortal man openly to her arms!                                 140
    So, when the rosy-finger'd Morning chose
    Orion, though ye live yourselves at ease,
    Yet ye all envied her, until the chaste
    Diana from her golden throne dispatch'd
    A silent shaft, which slew him in Ortygia.
    So, when the golden-tressed Ceres, urged
    By passion, took Iaesion to her arms
    In a thrice-labour'd fallow, not untaught
    Was Jove that secret long, and, hearing it,
    Indignant, slew him with his candent bolt.                       150
    So also, O ye Gods, ye envy me
    The mortal man, my comfort. Him I saved
    Myself, while solitary on his keel
    He rode, for with his sulph'rous arrow Jove
    Had cleft his bark amid the sable Deep.
    Then perish'd all his gallant friends, but him
    Billows and storms drove hither, whom I lov'd
    Sincere, and fondly destin'd to a life
    Immortal, unobnoxious to decay.
    But since no Deity may the designs                               160
    Elude or controvert of Jove supreme,
    Hence with him o'er the barren Deep, if such
    The Sov'reign's will, and such his stern command.
    But undismiss'd he goes by me, who ships
    Myself well-oar'd and mariners have none
    To send with him athwart the spacious flood;
    Yet freely, readily, my best advice
    I will afford him, that, escaping all
    Danger, he may regain his native shore.
      Then Hermes thus, the messenger of heav'n.                     170
    Act as thou say'st, fearing the frown of Jove,
    Lest, if provoked, he spare not even thee.
      So saying, the dauntless Argicide withdrew,
    And she (Jove's mandate heard) all-graceful went,
    Seeking the brave Ulysses; on the shore
    She found him seated; tears succeeding tears
    Delug'd his eyes, while, hopeless of return,
    Life's precious hours to eating cares he gave
    Continual, with the nymph now charm'd no more.
    Yet, cold as she was am'rous, still he pass'd                    180
    His nights beside her in the hollow grot,
    Constrain'd, and day by day the rocks among
    Which lined the shore heart-broken sat, and oft
    While wistfully he eyed the barren Deep,
    Wept, groaned, desponded, sigh'd, and wept again.
    Then, drawing near, thus spake the nymph divine.
      Unhappy! weep not here, nor life consume
    In anguish; go; thou hast my glad consent.
    Arise to labour; hewing down the trunks
    Of lofty trees, fashion them with the ax                         190
    To a broad raft, which closely floor'd above,
    Shall hence convey thee o'er the gloomy Deep.
    Bread, water, and the red grape's cheering juice
    Myself will put on board, which shall preserve
    Thy life from famine; I will also give
    New raiment for thy limbs, and will dispatch
    Winds after thee to waft thee home unharm'd,
    If such the pleasure of the Gods who dwell
    In yonder boundless heav'n, superior far
    To me, in knowledge and in skill to judge.                       200
      She ceas'd; but horror at that sound the heart
    Chill'd of Ulysses, and in accents wing'd
    With wonder, thus the noble Chief replied.
      Ah! other thoughts than of my safe return
    Employ thee, Goddess, now, who bid'st me pass
    The perilous gulph of Ocean on a raft,
    That wild expanse terrible, which even ships
    Pass not, though form'd to cleave their way with ease,
    And joyful in propitious winds from Jove.
    No--let me never, in despight of thee,                           210
    Embark on board a raft, nor till thou swear,
    O Goddess! the inviolable oath,
    That future mischief thou intend'st me none.
      He said; Calypso, beauteous Goddess, smiled,
    And, while she spake, stroaking his cheek, replied.
      Thou dost asperse me rudely, and excuse
    Of ignorance hast none, far better taught;
    What words were these? How could'st thou thus reply?
    Now hear me Earth, and the wide Heav'n above!
    Hear, too, ye waters of the Stygian stream                       220
    Under the earth (by which the blessed Gods
    Swear trembling, and revere the awful oath!)
    That future mischief I intend thee none.
    No, my designs concerning thee are such
    As, in an exigence resembling thine,
    Myself, most sure, should for myself conceive.
    I have a mind more equal, not of steel
    My heart is form'd, but much to pity inclined.
      So saying, the lovely Goddess with swift pace
    Led on, whose footsteps he as swift pursued.                     230
    Within the vaulted cavern they arrived,
    The Goddess and the man; on the same throne
    Ulysses sat, whence Hermes had aris'n,
    And viands of all kinds, such as sustain
    The life of mortal man, Calypso placed
    Before him, both for bev'rage and for food.
    She opposite to the illustrious Chief
    Reposed, by her attendant maidens served
    With nectar and ambrosia. They their hands
    Stretch'd forth together to the ready feast,                     240
    And when nor hunger more nor thirst remain'd
    Unsated, thus the beauteous nymph began.
      Laertes' noble son, for wisdom famed
    And artifice! oh canst thou thus resolve
    To seek, incontinent, thy native shores?
    I pardon thee. Farewell! but could'st thou guess
    The woes which fate ordains thee to endure
    Ere yet thou reach thy country, well-content
    Here to inhabit, thou would'st keep my grot
    And be immortal, howsoe'er thy wife                              250
    Engage thy ev'ry wish day after day.
    Yet can I not in stature or in form
    Myself suspect inferior aught to her,
    Since competition cannot be between
    Mere mortal beauties, and a form divine.
      To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied.
    Awful Divinity! be not incensed.
    I know that my Penelope in form
    And stature altogether yields to thee,
    For she is mortal, and immortal thou,                            260
    From age exempt; yet not the less I wish
    My home, and languish daily to return.
    But should some God amid the sable Deep
    Dash me again into a wreck, my soul
    Shall bear _that_ also; for, by practice taught,
    I have learned patience, having much endured
    By tempest and in battle both. Come then
    This evil also! I am well prepared.
      He ended, and the sun sinking, resign'd
    The earth to darkness. Then in a recess                          270
    Interior of the cavern, side by side
    Reposed, they took their amorous delight.
    But when Aurora, daughter of the dawn,
    Look'd rosy forth, Ulysses then in haste
    Put on his vest and mantle, and, the nymph
    Her snowy vesture of transparent woof,
    Graceful, redundant; to her waist she bound
    Her golden zone, and veil'd her beauteous head,
    Then, musing, plann'd the noble Chief's return.
    She gave him, fitted to the grasp, an ax                         280
    Of iron, pond'rous, double-edg'd, with haft
    Of olive-wood, inserted firm, and wrought
    With curious art. Then, placing in his hand
    A polish'd adze, she led, herself, the way
    To her isles' utmost verge, where tallest trees
    But dry long since and sapless stood, which best
    Might serve his purposes, as buoyant most,
    The alder, poplar, and cloud-piercing fir.
    To that tall grove she led and left him there,
    Seeking her grot again. Then slept not He,                       290
    But, swinging with both hands the ax, his task
    Soon finish'd; trees full twenty to the ground
    He cast, which, dext'rous, with his adze he smooth'd,
    The knotted surface chipping by a line.
    Meantime the lovely Goddess to his aid
    Sharp augres brought, with which he bored the beams,
    Then, side by side placing them, fitted each
    To other, and with long cramps join'd them all.
    Broad as an artist, skill'd in naval works,
    The bottom of a ship of burthen spreads,                         300
    Such breadth Ulysses to his raft assign'd.
    He deck'd her over with long planks, upborne
    On massy beams; He made the mast, to which
    He added suitable the yard;--he framed
    Rudder and helm to regulate her course,
    With wicker-work he border'd all her length
    For safety, and much ballast stow'd within.
    Meantime, Calypso brought him for a sail
    Fittest materials, which he also shaped,
    And to his sail due furniture annex'd                            310
    Of cordage strong, foot-ropes, and ropes aloft,
    Then heav'd her down with levers to the Deep.
    He finish'd all his work on the fourth day,
    And on the fifth, Calypso, nymph divine,
    Dismiss'd him from her isle, but laved him first,
    And cloath'd him in sweet-scented garments new.
    Two skins the Goddess also placed on board,
    One charg'd with crimson wine, and ampler one
    With water, nor a bag with food replete
    Forgot, nutritious, grateful to the taste,                       320
    Nor yet, her latest gift, a gentle gale
    And manageable, which Ulysses spread,
    Exulting, all his canvas to receive.
    Beside the helm he sat, steering expert,
    Nor sleep fell ever on his eyes that watch'd
    Intent the Pleiads, tardy in decline
    Bootes, and the Bear, call'd else the Wain,
    Which, in his polar prison circling, looks
    Direct toward Orion, and alone
    Of these sinks never to the briny Deep.                          330
    That star the lovely Goddess bade him hold
    Continual on his left through all his course.
    Ten days and sev'n, he, navigating, cleav'd
    The brine, and on the eighteenth day, at length,
    The shadowy mountains of Phaeacia's land
    Descried, where nearest to his course it lay
    Like a broad buckler on the waves afloat.
      But Neptune, now returning from the land
    Of Ethiopia, mark'd him on his raft
    Skimming the billows, from the mountain-tops                     340
    Of distant Solyma.[21] With tenfold wrath
    Inflamed that sight he view'd, his brows he shook,
    And thus within himself, indignant, spake.
      So then--new counsels in the skies, it seems,
    Propitious to Ulysses, have prevail'd
    Since AEthiopia hath been my abode.
    He sees Phaeacia nigh, where he must leap
    The bound'ry of his woes; but ere that hour
    Arrive, I will ensure him many a groan.
      So saying, he grasp'd his trident, gather'd dense              350
    The clouds and troubled ocean; ev'ry storm
    From ev'ry point he summon'd, earth and sea
    Darkening, and the night fell black from heav'n.
    The East, the South, the heavy-blowing West,
    And the cold North-wind clear, assail'd at once
    His raft, and heaved on high the billowy flood.
    All hope, all courage, in that moment, lost,
    The Hero thus within himself complain'd.
      Wretch that I am, what destiny at last
    Attends me! much I fear the Goddess' words                       360
    All true, which threaten'd me with num'rous ills
    On the wide sea, ere I should reach my home.
    Behold them all fulfill'd! with what a storm
    Jove hangs the heav'ns, and agitates the Deep!
    The winds combined beat on me. Now I sink!
    Thrice blest, and more than thrice, Achaia's sons
    At Ilium slain for the Atridae' sake!
    Ah, would to heav'n that, dying, I had felt
    That day the stroke of fate, when me the dead
    Achilles guarding, with a thousand spears                        370
    Troy's furious host assail'd! Funereal rites
    I then had shared, and praise from ev'ry Greek,
    Whom now the most inglorious death awaits.
      While thus he spake, a billow on his head
    Bursting impetuous, whirl'd the raft around,
    And, dashing from his grasp the helm, himself
    Plunged far remote. Then came a sudden gust
    Of mingling winds, that in the middle snapp'd
    His mast, and, hurried o'er the waves afar,
    Both sail and sail-yard fell into the flood.                     380
    Long time submerged he lay, nor could with ease
    The violence of that dread shock surmount,
    Or rise to air again, so burthensome
    His drench'd apparel proved; but, at the last,
    He rose, and, rising, sputter'd from his lips
    The brine that trickled copious from his brows.
    Nor, harass'd as he was, resign'd he yet
    His raft, but buffetting the waves aside
    With desp'rate efforts, seized it, and again
    Fast seated on the middle deck, escaped.                         390
    Then roll'd the raft at random in the flood,
    Wallowing unwieldy, toss'd from wave to wave.
    As when in autumn, Boreas o'er the plain
    Conglomerated thorns before him drives,
    They, tangled, to each other close adhere,
    So her the winds drove wild about the Deep.
    By turns the South consign'd her to be sport
    For the rude North-wind, and, by turns, the East
    Yielded her to the worrying West a prey.
    But Cadmus' beauteous daughter (Ino once,                        400
    Now named Leucothea) saw him; mortal erst
    Was she, and trod the earth,[22] but nymph become
    Of Ocean since, in honours shares divine.
    She mark'd his anguish, and, while toss'd he roam'd,
    Pitied Ulysses; from the flood, in form
    A cormorant, she flew, and on the raft
    Close-corded perching, thus the Chief address'd.
      Alas! unhappy! how hast thou incensed
    So terribly the Shaker of the shores,
    That he pursues thee with such num'rous ills?                    410
    Sink thee he cannot, wish it as he may.
    Thus do (for I account thee not unwise)
    Thy garments putting off, let drive thy raft
    As the winds will, then, swimming, strive to reach
    Phaeacia, where thy doom is to escape.
    Take this. This ribbon bind beneath thy breast,
    Celestial texture. Thenceforth ev'ry fear
    Of death dismiss, and, laying once thy hands
    On the firm continent, unbind the zone,
    Which thou shalt cast far distant from the shore                 420
    Into the Deep, turning thy face away.
      So saying, the Goddess gave into his hand
    The wond'rous zone, and, cormorant in form,
    Plunging herself into the waves again
    Headlong, was hidden by the closing flood.
    But still Ulysses sat perplex'd, and thus
    The toil-enduring Hero reason'd sad.
      Alas! I tremble lest some God design
    T' ensnare me yet, bidding me quit the raft.
    But let me well beware how I obey                                430
    Too soon that precept, for I saw the land
    Of my foretold deliv'rance far remote.
    Thus, therefore, will I do, for such appears
    My wiser course. So long as yet the planks
    Mutual adhere, continuing on board
    My raft, I will endure whatever woes,
    But when the waves shall shatter it, I will swim,
    My sole resource then left. While thus he mused,
    Neptune a billow of enormous bulk
    Hollow'd into an overwhelming arch                               440
    On high up-heaving, smote him. As the wind
    Tempestuous, falling on some stubble-heap,
    The arid straws dissipates ev'ry way,
    So flew the timbers. He, a single beam
    Bestriding, oar'd it onward with his feet,
    As he had urged an horse. His raiment, then,
    Gift of Calypso, putting off, he bound
    His girdle on, and prone into the sea
    With wide-spread palms prepar'd for swimming, fell.
    Shore-shaker Neptune noted him; he shook                         450
    His awful brows, and in his heart he said,
      Thus, suff'ring many mis'ries roam the flood,
    Till thou shalt mingle with a race of men
    Heav'n's special favourites; yet even there
    Fear not that thou shalt feel thy sorrows light.
      He said, and scourging his bright steeds, arrived
    At AEgae, where his glorious palace stands.
      But other thoughts Minerva's mind employ'd
    Jove's daughter; ev'ry wind binding beside,
    She lull'd them, and enjoin'd them all to sleep,                 460
    But roused swift Boreas, and the billows broke
    Before Ulysses, that, deliver'd safe
    From a dire death, the noble Chief might mix
    With maritime Phaeacia's sons renown'd.
      Two nights he wander'd, and two days, the flood
    Tempestuous, death expecting ev'ry hour;
    But when Aurora, radiant-hair'd, had brought
    The third day to a close, then ceas'd the wind,
    And breathless came a calm; he, nigh at hand
    The shore beheld, darting acute his sight                        470
    Toward it, from a billow's tow'ring top.
      Precious as to his children seems the life
    Of some fond father through disease long time
    And pain stretch'd languid on his couch, the prey
    Of some vindictive Pow'r, but now, at last,
    By gracious heav'n to ease and health restored,
    So grateful to Ulysses' sight appear'd
    Forests and hills. Impatient with his feet
    To press the shore, he swam; but when within
    Such distance as a shout may fly, he came,                       480
    The thunder of the sea against the rocks
    Then smote his ear; for hoarse the billows roar'd
    On the firm land, belch'd horrible abroad,
    And the salt spray dimm'd all things to his view.
    For neither port for ships nor shelt'ring cove
    Was there, but the rude coast a headland bluff
    Presented, rocks and craggy masses huge.
    Then, hope and strength exhausted both, deep-groan'd
    The Chief, and in his noble heart complain'd.
      Alas! though Jove hath given me to behold,                     490
    Unhoped, the land again, and I have pass'd,
    Furrowing my way, these num'rous waves, there seems
    No egress from the hoary flood for me.
    Sharp stones hem in the waters; wild the surge
    Raves ev'ry where; and smooth the rocks arise;
    Deep also is the shore, on which my feet
    No standing gain, or chance of safe escape.
    What if some billow catch me from the Deep
    Emerging, and against the pointed rocks
    Dash me conflicting with its force in vain?                      500
    But should I, swimming, trace the coast in search
    Of sloping beach, haven or shelter'd creek,
    I fear lest, groaning, I be snatch'd again
    By stormy gusts into the fishy Deep,
    Or lest some monster of the flood receive
    Command to seize me, of the many such
    By the illustrious Amphitrite bred;
    For that the mighty Shaker of the shores
    Hates me implacable, too well I know.
      While such discourse within himself he held,                   510
    A huge wave heav'd him on the rugged coast,
    Where flay'd his flesh had been, and all his bones
    Broken together, but for the infused
    Good counsel of Minerva azure-eyed.
    With both hands suddenly he seized the rock,
    And, groaning, clench'd it till the billow pass'd.
    So baffled he that wave; but yet again
    The refluent flood rush'd on him, and with force
    Resistless dash'd him far into the sea.
    As pebbles to the hollow polypus                                 520
    Extracted from his stony bed, adhere,
    So he, the rough rocks clasping, stripp'd his hands
    Raw, and the billows now whelm'd him again.
    Then had the hapless Hero premature
    Perish'd, but for sagacity inspired
    By Pallas azure-eyed. Forth from the waves
    Emerging, where the surf burst on the rocks,
    He coasted (looking landward as he swam)
    The shore, with hope of port or level beach.
    But when, still swimming, to the mouth he came                   530
    Of a smooth-sliding river, there he deem'd
    Safest th' ascent, for it was undeform'd
    By rocks, and shelter'd close from ev'ry wind.
    He felt the current, and thus, ardent, pray'd.
      O hear, whate'er thy name, Sov'reign, who rul'st
    This river! at whose mouth, from all the threats
    Of Neptune 'scap'd, with rapture I arrive.
    Even the Immortal Gods the wand'rer's pray'r
    Respect, and such am I, who reach, at length,
    Thy stream, and clasp thy knees, after long toil.                540
    I am thy suppliant. Oh King! pity me.
      He said; the river God at once repress'd
    His current, and it ceas'd; smooth he prepared
    The way before Ulysses, and the land
    Vouchsafed him easy at his channel's mouth.
    There, once again he bent for ease his limbs
    Both arms and knees, in conflict with the floods
    Exhausted; swoln his body was all o'er,
    And from his mouth and nostrils stream'd the brine.
    Breathless and speechless, and of life well nigh                 550
    Bereft he lay, through dreadful toil immense.
    But when, revived, his dissipated pow'rs
    He recollected, loosing from beneath
    His breast the zone divine, he cast it far
    Into the brackish stream, and a huge wave
    Returning bore it downward to the sea,
    Where Ino caught it. Then, the river's brink
    Abandoning, among the rushes prone
    He lay, kiss'd oft the soil, and sighing, said,
    Ah me! what suff'rings must I now sustain,                       560
    What doom, at last, awaits me? If I watch
    This woeful night, here, at the river's side,
    What hope but that the frost and copious dews,
    Weak as I am, my remnant small of life
    Shall quite extinguish, and the chilly air
    Breath'd from the river at the dawn of day?
    But if, ascending this declivity
    I gain the woods, and in some thicket sleep,
    (If sleep indeed can find me overtoil'd
    And cold-benumb'd) then I have cause to fear                     570
    Lest I be torn by wild beasts, and devour'd.
      Long time he mused, but, at the last, his course
    Bent to the woods, which not remote he saw
    From the sea-brink, conspicuous on a hill.
    Arrived, between two neighbour shrubs he crept,
    Both olives, this the fruitful, that the wild;
    A covert, which nor rough winds blowing moist
    Could penetrate, nor could the noon-day sun
    Smite through it, or unceasing show'rs pervade,
    So thick a roof the ample branches form'd                        580
    Close interwoven; under these the Chief
    Retiring, with industrious hands a bed
    Collected broad of leaves, which there he found
    Abundant strew'd, such store as had sufficed
    Two travellers or three for cov'ring warm,
    Though winter's roughest blasts had rag'd the while.
    That bed with joy the suff'ring Chief renown'd
    Contemplated, and occupying soon
    The middle space, hillock'd it high with leaves.
    As when some swain hath hidden deep his torch                    590
    Beneath the embers, at the verge extreme
    Of all his farm, where, having neighbours none,
    He saves a seed or two of future flame
    Alive, doom'd else to fetch it from afar,
    So with dry leaves Ulysses overspread
    His body, on whose eyes Minerva pour'd
    The balm of sleep copious, that he might taste
    Repose again, after long toil severe.
