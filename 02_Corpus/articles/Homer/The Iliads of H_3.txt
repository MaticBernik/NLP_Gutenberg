The varieties of other reports touching this I omit for length; and
in place thereof think it not unfit to insert something of his praise
and honour amongst the greatest of all ages; not that our most
absolute of himself needs it, but that such authentical testimonies
of his splendour and excellence may the better convince the malice of
his maligners.
First, what kind of person Homer was, saith Spondanus, his statue
teacheth, which Cedrenus describeth. The whole place we will describe
that our relation may hold the better coherence, as Xylander converts
it. Then was the Octagonon at Constantinople consumed with fire; and
the bath of Severus, that bore the name of Zeuxippus, in which there
was much variety of spectacle, and splendour of arts; the works of
all ages being conferred and preserved there, of marble, rocks,
stones, and images of brass; to which this only wanted, that the
souls of the persons they presented were not in them. Amongst these
master-pieces and all-wit-exceeding workmanships stood Homer, as he
was in his age, thoughtful and musing, his hands folded beneath his
bosom, his beard untrimm'd and hanging down, the hair of his head in
like sort thin on both sides before, his face with age and cares of
the world, as these imagine, wrinkled and austere, his nose
proportioned to his other parts, his eyes fixed or turned up to his
eyebrows, like one blind, as it is reported he was." (Not born blind,
saith Vell. Paterculus, which he that imagines, saith he, is blind of
all senses.) "Upon his under-coat he was attired with a loose robe,
and at the base beneath his feet a brazen chain hung." This was the
statue of Homer, which in that conflagration perished. Another
renowned statue of his, saith Lucian in his Encomion of Demosthenes,
stood in the temple of Ptolemy, on the upper hand of his own statue.
Cedrenus likewise remembereth a library in the palace of the king, at
Constantinople, that contained a thousand a hundred and twenty books,
amongst which there was the gut of a dragon of an hundred and twenty
foot long, in which, in letters of gold, the Iliads and Odysseys of
Homer were inscribed; which miracle, in Basiliscus the Emperor's
time, was consumed with fire.
For his respect amongst the most learned, Plato _in Ione_ calleth him
_<U+1F04><U+03C1><U+03B9><U+03C3><U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03BD> <U+03BA><U+03B1><U+1F76> <U+03B8><U+03B5><U+03B9><U+1F79><U+03C4><U+03B1><U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03BD> <U+03C4><U+03C9><U+0311><U+03BD> <U+03C0><U+03BF><U+03B9><U+03B7><U+03C4><U+03C9><U+0311><U+03BD>, Poeta rum omnium et
prastantissimum et divinissimum; in Phadone, <U+03B8><U+03B5><U+03B9><U+0311><U+03BF><U+03BD> <U+03C0><U+03BF><U+03B9><U+03B7><U+03C4><U+1F74><U+03BD>, divinum
Poetam_; and in _Theatetus_, Socrates citing divers of the most wise
and learned for confirmation of his there held opinion, as
Protagoras, Heraclitus, Empedocles, Epicharmus, and Homer, who, saith
Socrates, against such an army, being all led by such a captain as
Homer, dares fight or resist, but he will be held ridiculous? This
for Scaliger and all Homer's envious and ignorant detractors. Why
therefore Plato in another place banisheth him with all other poets
out of his Commonwealth, dealing with them like a Politician indeed,
use men, and then cast them off, though Homer he thinks fit to send
out crowned and anointed, I see not, since he maketh still such
honourable mention of him, and with his verses, as with precious
gems, everywhere enchaceth his writings. So Aristotle continually
celebrateth him. Nay, even amongst the barbarous, not only Homer's
name, but his poems have been recorded and reverenced. The Indians,
saith Alianus (Var. Hist. lib. xii. cap. 48) in their own tongue had
Homer's Poems translated and sung. Nor those Indians alone, but the
kings of Persia. And amongst the Indians, of all the Greek poets,
Homer being ever first in estimation; whensoever they used any divine
duties according to the custom of their households and hospitalities,
they invited ever Apollo and Homer. Lucian in his Encomion of
Demosth. affirmeth all Poets celebrated Homers birthday, and
sacrificed to him the first fruits of their verses. So Thersagoras
answereth Lucian, he used to do himself. Alex. Paphius, saith
Eustathius, delivers Homer as born of Egyptian parents, Dmasagoras
being his father, and Athra his mother, his nurse being a certain
prophetess and the daughter of Oris, Isis' priest, from whose
breasts, oftentimes, honey flowed in the mouth of the infant. After
which, in the night, he uttered nine several notes or voices of
fowls, viz. of a swallow, a peacock, a dove, a crow, a partridge, a
redshank, a stare, a blackbird, and a nightingale; and, being a
little boy, was found playing in his bed with nine doves. Sibylla
being at a feast of his parents was taken with sudden fury, and sung
verses whose beginning was _<U+0394>µ<U+03B1><U+03C3><U+03B1><U+03B3> <U+1F79><U+03C1><U+03B1> <U+03C0><U+03BF><U+03BB><U+1F7B><U+03BD><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03B5>; polynice_,
signifying much victory, in which song also she called him _µ<U+03B5><U+03B3><U+1F71><U+03BA><U+03BB><U+03B5><U+03B1>,
great in glory_, and _<U+03C3><U+03C4><U+03B5><U+03D5><U+03B1><U+03BD><U+1F77><U+03C4><U+03B7><U+03BD>_, signifying _garland-seller_, and
commanded him to build a temple to the Pegridarij, that is, to the
Muses. Herodotus affirms that Phamius, teaching a public school at
Smyrna, was his master; and Dionysius in his 56th Oration saith,
Socrates was Homer's scholar. In short, what he was, his works show
most truly; to which, if you please, go on and examine him.
