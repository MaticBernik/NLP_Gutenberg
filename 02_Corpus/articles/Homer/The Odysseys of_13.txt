<U+202D>  He shows from Hell his safe retreat
<U+202D>  To th isle Aaa, Circes seat;
<U+202D>  And how he scapd the Sirens calls,
<U+202D>  With th erring rocks, and waters falls,
<U+202D>  That Scylla and Charybdis break;
<U+202D>  The Sun s stol n herds; and his sad wreak
<U+202D>  Both of Ulysses ship and men,
<U+202D>  His own head scaping scarce the pain.
<U+202D>
<U+202D>  ANOTHER ARGUMENT
<U+202D>  _<U+039C><U+03C5><U+0311>_
<U+202D>     The rocks that errd,
<U+202D>        The Sirens call.
<U+202D>     The Suns stoln herd.
<U+202D>        The soldiers fall.
<U+202D>  Our ship now past the straits of th ocean flood,
<U+202D>  She plowd the broad seas billows, and made good
<U+202D>  The isle Aaa, where the palace stands
<U+202D>  Of th early riser with the rosy hands,
<U+202D>  Active Aurora, where she loves to dance,
<U+202D>  And where the Sun doth his prime beams advance.
<U+202D>     When here arrivd, we drew her up to land,
<U+202D>  And trod ourselves the re-saluted sand,
<U+202D>  Found on the shore fit resting for the night,
<U+202D>  Slept, and expected the celestial light.
<U+202D>     Soon as the white-and-red-mixd fingerd Dame
<U+202D>  Had gilt the mountains with her saffron flame,
<U+202D>  I sent my men to Circes house before,
<U+202D>  To fetch deceasd Elpenor to the shore.
<U+202D>     Straight swelld the high banks with fell'd heaps of trees,
<U+202D>  And, full of tears, we did due exsequies
<U+202D>  To our dead friend.  Whose corse consumd with fire,
<U+202D>  And honourd arms, whose sepulchre entire,
<U+202D>  And over that a column raisd, his oar,
<U+202D>  Curiously carvd, to his desire before,
<U+202D>  Upon the top of all his tomb we fixd.
<U+202D>  Of all rites fit his funeral pile was mixd.
<U+202D>     Nor was our safe ascent from Hell conceald
<U+202D>  From Circes knowledge; nor so soon reveald
<U+202D>  But she was with us, with her bread and food,
<U+202D>  And ruddy wine, brought by her sacred brood
<U+202D>  Of woods and fountains.  In the midst she stood,
<U+202D>  And thus saluted us;  Unhappy men,
<U+202D>  That have, informd with all your senses, been
<U+202D>  In Plutos dismal mansion!  You shall die
<U+202D>  Twice now, where others, that Mortality
<U+202D>  In her fair arms holds, shall but once decease.
<U+202D>  But eat and drink out all conceit of these,
<U+202D>  And this day dedicate to food and wine,
<U+202D>  The following night to sleep.  When next shall shine
<U+202D>  The cheerful morning, you shall prove the seas.
<U+202D>  Your way, and evry act ye must address,
<U+202D>  My knowledge of their order shall design,
<U+202D>  Lest with your own bad counsels ye incline
<U+202D>  Events as bad against ye, and sustain,
<U+202D>  By sea and shore, the woful ends that reign
<U+202D>  In wilful actions.  Thus did she advise
<U+202D>  And, for the time, our fortunes were so wise
<U+202D>  To follow wise directions.  All that day
<U+202D>  We sat and feasted.  When his lower way
<U+202D>  The Sun had entered, and the Even the high,
<U+202D>  My friends slept on their gables; she and I
<U+202D>  (Led by her fair hand to place apart,
<U+202D>  By her well-sorted) did to sleep convert
<U+202D>  Our timid powrs; when all things Fate let fall
<U+202D>  In our affair she askd; I told her all.
<U+202D>  To which she answerd:  These things thus took end.
<U+202D>  And now to those that I inform attend,
<U+202D>  Which you remembring, God himself shall be
<U+202D>  The blesséd author of your memory.
<U+202D>     First to the Sirens ye shall come, that taint
<U+202D>  The minds of all men whom they can acquaint
<U+202D>  With their attractions.  Whosoever shall,
<U+202D>  For want of knowledge movd, but hear the call
<U+202D>  Of any Siren, he will so despise
<U+202D>  Both wife and children, for their sorceries,
<U+202D>  That never home turns his affections stream,
<U+202D>  Nor they take joy in him, nor he in them.
<U+202D>  The Sirens will so soften with their song
<U+202D>  (Shrill, and in sensual appetite so strong)
<U+202D>  His loose affections, that he gives them head.
<U+202D>  And then observe:  They sit amidst a mead,
<U+202D>  And round about it runs a hedge or wall
<U+202D>  Of dead mens bones, their witherd skins and all
<U+202D>  Hung all along upon it; and these men
<U+202D>  Were such as they had fawnd into their fen,
<U+202D>  And then their skins hung on their hedge of bones.
<U+202D>  Sail by them therefore, thy companions
<U+202D>  Beforehand causing to stop evry ear
<U+202D>  With sweet soft wax, so close that none may hear
<U+202D>  A note of all their charmings.  Yet may you,
<U+202D>  If you affect it, open ear allow
<U+202D>  To try their motion; but presume not so
<U+202D>  To trust your judgment, when your senses go
<U+202D>  So loose about you, but give strait command
<U+202D>  To all your men, to bind you foot and hand
<U+202D>  Sure to the mast, that you may safe approve
<U+202D>  How strong in instigation to their love
<U+202D>  Their rapting tunes are.  If so much they move,
<U+202D>  That, spite of all your reason, your will stands
<U+202D>  To be enfranchisd both of feet and hands,
<U+202D>  Charge all your men before to slight your charge,
<U+202D>  And rest so far from fearing to enlarge
<U+202D>  That much more sure they bind you.  When your friends
<U+202D>  Have outsaild these, the danger that transcends
<U+202D>  Rests not in any counsel to prevent,
<U+202D>  Unless your own mind finds the tract and bent
<U+202D>  Of that way that avoids it.  I can say
<U+202D>  That in your course there lies a twofold way,
<U+202D>  The right of which your own, taught, present wit,
<U+202D>  And grace divine, must prompt.  In genral yet
<U+202D>  Let this inform you:  Near these Sirens shore
<U+202D>  Move two steep rocks, at whose feet lie and roar
<U+202D>  The black seas cruel billows; the blessd Gods
<U+202D>  Call them the Rovers.  Their abhorrd abodes
<U+202D>  No bird can pass; no not the doves, whose fear  [1]
<U+202D>  Sire Jove so loves that they are said to bear
<U+202D>  Ambrosia to him, can their ravine scape,
<U+202D>  But one of them falls ever to the rape
<U+202D>  Of those sly rocks; yet Jove another still
<U+202D>  Adds to the rest, that so may ever fill
<U+202D>  The sacred number.  Never ship could shun
<U+202D>  The nimble peril wingd there, but did run
<U+202D>  With all her bulk, and bodies of her men,
<U+202D>  To utter ruin.  For the seas retain
<U+202D>  Not only their outrageous asture there,
<U+202D>  But fierce assistants of particular fear,
<U+202D>  And supernatural mischief, they exspire,
<U+202D>  And those are whirlwinds of devouring fire
<U+202D>  Whisking about still.  Th Argive ship alone,
<U+202D>  Which bore the care of all men, got her gone,  [2]
<U+202D>  Come from Areta.  Yet perhaps evn she
<U+202D>  Had wrackd at those rocks, if the Deity,
<U+202D>  That lies by Joves side, had not lent her hand
<U+202D>  To their transmission; since the man, that mannd
<U+202D>  In chief that voyage, she in chief did love.
<U+202D>  Of these two spiteful rocks, the one doth shove
<U+202D>  Against the height of heavn her pointed brow.
<U+202D>  A black cloud binds it round, and never show
<U+202D>  Lends to the sharp point; not the clear blue sky
<U+202D>  Lets ever view it, not the summers eye,
<U+202D>  Nor fervent autumns.  None that death could end
<U+202D>  Could ever scale it, or, if up, descend,
<U+202D>  Though twenty hands and feet he had for hold,
<U+202D>  A polishd ice-like glibness doth enfold
<U+202D>  The rock so round, whose midst a gloomy cell
<U+202D>  Shrouds so far westward that it sees to hell.
<U+202D>  From this keep you as far, as from his bow
<U+202D>  An able young man can his shaft bestow.
<U+202D>  For here the whuling Scylla shrouds her face,  [3]
<U+202D>  That breathes a voice at all parts no more base
<U+202D>  Than are a newly-kittend kitlings cries,
<U+202D>  Herself a monster yet of boundless size,
<U+202D>  Whose sight would nothing please a mortals eyes,
<U+202D>  No nor the eyes of any God, if he
<U+202D>  (Whom nought should fright) fell foul on her, and she
<U+202D>  Her full shape showd.  Twelve foul feet bear about
<U+202D>  Her ugly bulk.  Six huge long necks look out
<U+202D>  Of her rank shoulders; evry neck doth let
<U+202D>  A ghastly head out; evry head three set,
<U+202D>  Thick thrust together, of abhorréd teeth,
<U+202D>  And evry tooth stuck with a sable death.
<U+202D>     She lurks in midst of all her den, and streaks
<U+202D>  From out a ghastly whirlpool all her necks;
<U+202D>  Where, gloting round her rock, to fish she falls;
<U+202D>  And up rush dolphins, dogfish; somewhiles whales
<U+202D>  If got within her when her rapine feeds;
<U+202D>  For ever-groaning Amphitrite breeds
<U+202D>  About her whirlpool an unmeasurd store.
<U+202D>  No sea-man ever boasted touch of shore
<U+202D>  That there touchd with his ship, but still she fed
<U+202D>  Of him and his; a man for evry head
<U+202D>  Spoiling his ship of.  You shall then descry
<U+202D>  The other humbler rock, that moves so nigh
<U+202D>  Your dart may mete the distance.  It receives
<U+202D>  A huge wild fig-tree, curld with ample leaves,
<U+202D>  Beneath whose shades divine Charybdis sits,
<U+202D>  Supping the black deeps.  Thrice a day her pits
<U+202D>  She drinking all dry, and thrice a day again
<U+202D>  All up she belches, baneful to sustain.
<U+202D>  When she is drinking, dare not near her draught,
<U+202D>  For not the force of Neptune, if once caught,
<U+202D>  Can force your freedom.  Therefore, in your strife
<U+202D>  To scape Charybdis, labour all for life
<U+202D>  To row near Scylla, for she will but have
<U+202D>  For her six heads six men; and better save
<U+202D>  The rest, than all make offrings to the wave.
<U+202D>     This need she told me of my loss, when I
<U+202D>  Desird to know, if that Necessity,
<U+202D>  When I had scapd Charybdis outrages,
<U+202D>  My powrs might not revenge, though not redress?
<U+202D>  She answerd:  O unhappy!  art thou yet
<U+202D>  Enflamd with war, and thirst to drink thy sweat?
<U+202D>  Not to the Gods give up both arms and will?
<U+202D>  She deathless is, and that immortal ill
<U+202D>  Grave, harsh, outrageous, not to be subdued,
<U+202D>  That men must suffer till they be renewd.
<U+202D>  Nor lives there any virtue that can fly
<U+202D>  The vicious outrage of their cruelty.
<U+202D>  Shouldst thou put arms on, and approach the rock,
<U+202D>  I fear six more must expiate the shock.
<U+202D>  Six heads six men ask still.  Hoise sail, and fly,
<U+202D>  And, in thy flight, aloud on Cratis cry
<U+202D>  (Great Scyllas mother, who exposd to light
<U+202D>  The bane of men) and she will do such right
<U+202D>  To thy observance, that she down will tread
<U+202D>  Her daughters rage, nor let her show a head.
<U+202D>     From thenceforth then, for ever past her care,
<U+202D>  Thou shalt ascend the isle triangular,
<U+202D>  Where many oxen of the Sun are fed,
<U+202D>  And fatted flocks.  Of oxen fifty head
<U+202D>  In evry herd feed, and their herds are seven;
<U+202D>  And of his fat flocks is their number even.
<U+202D>  Increase they yield not, for they never die.
<U+202D>  There evry shepherdess a Deity.
<U+202D>  Fair Phaëthusa, and Lampetié,
<U+202D>  The lovely Nymphs are that their guardians be,
<U+202D>  Who to the daylights lofty-going Flame
<U+202D>  Had gracious birthright from the heavnly Dame,
<U+202D>  Still young Neara; who (brought forth and bred)
<U+202D>  Far off dismissd them, to see duly fed
<U+202D>  Their fathers herds and flocks in Sicily.
<U+202D>  These herds and flocks if to the Deity
<U+202D>  Ye leave, as sacred things, untouchd, and on
<U+202D>  Go with all fit care of your home, alone,
<U+202D>  (Though through some suffrance) you yet safe shall land
<U+202D>  In wishéd Ithaca.  But if impious hand
<U+202D>  You lay on those herds to their hurts, I then
<U+202D>  Presage sure ruin to thy ship and men.
<U+202D>  If thou escapst thyself, extending home
<U+202D>  Thy longd-for landing, thou shalt loaded come
<U+202D>  With store of losses, most exceeding late,
<U+202D>  And not consorted with a savéd mate.
<U+202D>     This said, the golden-thrond Aurora rose,
<U+202D>  She her way went, and I did mine dispose
<U+202D>  Up to my ship, weighd anchor, and away.
<U+202D>  When revrend Circe helpd us to convey
<U+202D>  Our vessel safe, by making well inclind
<U+202D>  A seamans true companion, a forewind,
<U+202D>  With which she filld our sails; when, fitting all
<U+202D>  Our arms close by us, I did sadly fall
<U+202D>  To grave relation what concernd in fate
<U+202D>  My friends to know, and told them that the state
<U+202D>  Of our affairs success, which Circe had
<U+202D>  Presagd to me alone, must yet be made
<U+202D>  To one nor only two known, but to all;
<U+202D>  That, since their lives and deaths were left to fall
<U+202D>  In their elections, they might life elect,
<U+202D>  And give what would preserve it fit effect.
<U+202D>     I first informd them, that we were to fly
<U+202D>  The heavnly-singing Sirens harmony,
<U+202D>  And flowr-adorned meadow; and that I
<U+202D>  Had charge to hear their song, but fetterd fast
<U+202D>  In bands, unfavourd, to th erected mast,
<U+202D>  From whence, if I should pray, or use command,
<U+202D>  To be enlargd, they should with much more band
<U+202D>  Contain my strugglings.  This I simply told
<U+202D>  To each particular, nor would withhold
<U+202D>  What most enjoind mine own affections stay,
<U+202D>  That theirs the rather might be taught t obey.
<U+202D>     In mean time flew our ships, and straight we fetchd
<U+202D>  The Sirens isle; a spleenless wind so stretchd
<U+202D>  Her wings to waft us, and so urgd our keel.
<U+202D>  But having reachd this isle, we could not feel
<U+202D>  The least gasp of it, it was stricken dead,
<U+202D>  And all the sea in prostrate slumber spread,
<U+202D>  The Sirens devil charmd all.  Up then flew
<U+202D>  My friends to work, struck sail, together drew,
<U+202D>  And under hatches stowd them, sat, and plied
<U+202D>  The polishd oars, and did in curls divide
<U+202D>  The white-head waters.  My part then came on:
<U+202D>  A mighty waxen cake I set upon,
<U+202D>  Choppd it in fragments with my sword, and wrought
<U+202D>  With strong hand evry piece, till all were soft.
<U+202D>  The great powr of the sun, in such a beam
<U+202D>  As then flew burning from his diadem,
<U+202D>  To liquefaction helpd us.  Orderly
<U+202D>  I stoppd their ears; and they as fair did ply
<U+202D>  My feet and hands with cords, and to the mast
<U+202D>  With other halsers made me soundly fast.
<U+202D>     Then took they seat, and forth our passage strook,
<U+202D>  The foamy sea beneath their labour shook.
<U+202D>     Rowd on, in reach of an erected voice,
<U+202D>  The Sirens soon took note, without our noise,
<U+202D>  Tund those sweet accents that made charms so strong,
<U+202D>  And these learnd numbers made the Sirens song:
<U+202D>     _Come here, thou worthy of a world of praise,
<U+202D>  That dost so high the Grecian glory raise,
<U+202D>  Ulysses!  stay thy ship, and that song hear
<U+202D>  That none passd ever but it bent his ear,
<U+202D>  But left him ravishd, and instructed more
<U+202D>  By us, than any ever heard before.
<U+202D>  For we know all things whatsoever were
<U+202D>  In wide Troy labourd; whatsoever there
<U+202D>  The Grecians and the Trojans both sustaind
<U+202D>  By those high issues that the Gods ordaind.
<U+202D>  And whatsoever all the earth can show
<U+202D>  T inform a knowledge of desert, we know._
<U+202D>     This they gave accent in the sweetest strain
<U+202D>  That ever opend an enamourd vein.
<U+202D>  When my constraind heart needs would have mine ear
<U+202D>  Yet more delighted, force way forth, and hear.
<U+202D>  To which end I commanded with all sign
<U+202D>  Stern looks could make (for not a joint of mine
<U+202D>  Had powr to stir) my friends to rise, and give
<U+202D>  My limbs free way.  They freely strivd to drive
<U+202D>  Their ship still on.  When, far from will to loose,
<U+202D>  Eurylochus and Perimedes rose
<U+202D>  To wrap me surer, and oppressd me more
<U+202D>  With many a halser than had use before.
<U+202D>  When, rowing on without the reach of sound,
<U+202D>  My friends unstoppd their ears, and me unbound,
<U+202D>  And that isle quite we quitted.  But again
<U+202D>  Fresh fears employd us.  I beheld a main
<U+202D>  Of mighty billows, and a smoke ascend,
<U+202D>  A horrid murmur hearing.  Evry friend
<U+202D>  Astonishd sat; from evry hand his Oar
<U+202D>  Fell quite forsaken; with the dismal roar
<U+202D>  Were all things there made echoes; stone-still stood
<U+202D>  Our ship itself, because the ghastly flood
<U+202D>  Took all mens motions from her in their own.
<U+202D>  I through the ship went, labouring up and down
<U+202D>  My friends recoverd spirits.  One by one
<U+202D>  I gave good words, and said:  That well were known
<U+202D>  These ills to them before, I told them all,
<U+202D>  And that these could not prove more capital
<U+202D>  Than those the Cyclops blockd us up in, yet
<U+202D>  My virtue, wit, and heavn-helpd counsels set
<U+202D>  Their freedoms open.  I could not believe
<U+202D>  But they rememberd it, and wishd them give
<U+202D>  My equal care and means now equal trust.
<U+202D>  The strength they had for stirring up they must
<U+202D>  Rouse and extend, to try if Jove had laid
<U+202D>  His powrs in theirs up, and would add his aid
<U+202D>  To scape evn that death.  In particular then,
<U+202D>  I told our pilot, that past other men
<U+202D>  He most must bear firm spirits, since he swayd
<U+202D>  The continent that all our spirits conveyd,
<U+202D>  In his whole guide of her.  He saw there boil
<U+202D>  The fiery whirlpools that to all our spoil
<U+202D>  Inclosd a rock, without which he must steer,
<U+202D>  Or all our ruins stood concluded there.
<U+202D>     All heard me and obeyd, and little knew
<U+202D>  That, shunning that rock, six of them should rue
<U+202D>  The wrack another hid.  For I conceald
<U+202D>  The heavy wounds, that never would be heald,
<U+202D>  To be by Scylla opend; for their fear
<U+202D>  Would then have robbd all of all care to steer,
<U+202D>  Or stir an oar, and made them hide beneath,
<U+202D>  When they and all had died an idle death.
<U+202D>  But then evn I forgot to shun the harm
<U+202D>  Circe forewarnd; who willd I should not arm,
<U+202D>  Nor show myself to Scylla, lest in vain
<U+202D>  I venturd life.  Yet could not I contain,
<U+202D>  But armd at all parts, and two lances took,
<U+202D>  Up to the foredeck went, and thence did look
<U+202D>  That rocky Scylla would have first appeard
<U+202D>  And taken my life with the friends I feard.
<U+202D>     From thence yet no place could afford her sight,
<U+202D>  Though through the dark rock mine eye threw her light,
<U+202D>  And ransackd all ways.  I then took a strait
<U+202D>  That gave myself, and some few more, receit
<U+202D>  Twixt Scylla and Charybdis; whence we saw
<U+202D>  How horridly Charybdis throat did draw
<U+202D>  The brackish sea up, which when all aboard
<U+202D>  She spit again out, never caldron sod
<U+202D>  With so much fervour, fed with all the store
<U+202D>  That could enrage it; all the rock did roar
<U+202D>  With troubled waters; round about the tops
<U+202D>  Of all the steep crags flew the foamy drops.
<U+202D>  But when her draught the sea and earth dissunderd,
<U+202D>  The troubled bottoms turnd up, and she thunderd,
<U+202D>  Far under shore the swart sands naked lay.
<U+202D>  Whose whole stern sight the startled blood did fray
<U+202D>  From all our faces.  And while we on her
<U+202D>  Our eyes bestowd thus to our ruins fear,
<U+202D>  Six friends had Scylla snatchd out of our keel,
<U+202D>  In whom most loss did force and virtue feel.
<U+202D>  When looking to my ship, and lending eye
<U+202D>  To see my friends estates, their heels turnd high,
<U+202D>  And hands cast up, I might discern, and hear
<U+202D>  Their calls to me for help, when now they were
<U+202D>  To try me in their last extremities.
<U+202D>  And as an angler medcine for surprise
<U+202D>  Of little fish sits pouring from the rocks,
<U+202D>  From out the crookd horn of a fold-bred ox,
<U+202D>  And then with his long angle hoists them high
<U+202D>  Up to the air, then slightly hurls them by,
<U+202D>  When helpless sprawling on the land they lie;
<U+202D>  So easly Scylla to her rock had rapt
<U+202D>  My woeful friends, and so unhelpd entrapt
<U+202D>  Struggling they lay beneath her violent rape,
<U+202D>  Who in their tortures, desprate of escape,
<U+202D>  Shriekd as she tore, and up their hands to me
<U+202D>  Still threw for sweet life.  I did never see,
<U+202D>  In all my suffrance ransacking the seas,
<U+202D>  A spectacle so full of miseries.
<U+202D>     Thus having fled these rocks (these cruel dames
<U+202D>  Scylla, Charybdis) where the King of flames
<U+202D>  Hath offrings burnd to him, our ship put in
<U+202D>  The island that from all the earth doth win
<U+202D>  The epithet _Faultless,_ where the broad-of-head
<U+202D>  And famous oxen for the Sun are fed,
<U+202D>  With many fat flocks of that high-gone God.
<U+202D>  Set in my ship, mine ear reachd where we rode
<U+202D>  The bellowing of oxen, and the bleat
<U+202D>  Of fleecy sheep, that in my memorys seat
<U+202D>  Put up the forms that late had been imprest
<U+202D>  By dread Aan Circe, and the best
<U+202D>  Of souls and prophets, the blind Theban seer,
<U+202D>  The wise Tiresias, who was grave decreer
<U+202D>  Of my returns whole means; of which this one
<U+202D>  In chief he urgd--that I should always shun
<U+202D>  The island of the man-delighting Sun.
<U+202D>  When, sad at heart for our late loss, I prayd
<U+202D>  My friends to hear fit counsel (though dismayd
<U+202D>  With all ill fortunes) which was givn to me
<U+202D>  By Circes and Tiresias prophecy,--
<U+202D>  That I should fly the isle where was adord
<U+202D>  The Comfort of the world, for ills abhorrd
<U+202D>  Were ambushd for us there; and therefore willd
<U+202D>  They should put off and leave the isle.  This killd
<U+202D>  Their tender spirits; when Eurylochus
<U+202D>  A speech that vexd me utterd, answring thus:
<U+202D>     Cruel Ulysses!  Since thy nerves abound
<U+202D>  In strength, the more spent, and no toils confound
<U+202D>  Thy able limbs, as all beat out of steel,
<U+202D>  Thou ablest us too, as unapt to feel
<U+202D>  The teeth of Labour, and the spoil of Sleep,
<U+202D>  And therefore still wet waste us in the deep,
<U+202D>  Nor let us land to eat, but madly now
<U+202D>  In night put forth, and leave firm land to strew
<U+202D>  The sea with errors.  All the rabid flight
<U+202D>  Of winds that ruin ships are bred in night.
<U+202D>  Who is it that can keep off cruel Death,
<U+202D>  If suddenly should rush out th angry breath
<U+202D>  Of Notus, or the eager-spirited West,
<U+202D>  That cuff ships dead, and do the Gods their best?
<U+202D>  Serve black Night still with shore, meat, sleep, and ease,
<U+202D>  And offer to the Morning for the seas.
<U+202D>     This all the rest approvd, and then knew I
<U+202D>  That past all doubt the Devil did apply
<U+202D>  His slaughtrous works.  Nor would they be withheld;
<U+202D>  I was but one, nor yielded but compelld.
<U+202D>  But all that might contain them I assayd,
<U+202D>  A sacred oath on all their powrs I laid,
<U+202D>  That if with herds or any richest-flocks
<U+202D>  We chancd t encounter, neither sheep nor ox
<U+202D>  We once should touch, nor (for that constant ill
<U+202D>  That follows folly) scorn advice and kill,
<U+202D>  But quiet sit us down and take such food
<U+202D>  As the immortal Circe had bestowd.
<U+202D>     They swore all this in all severest sort;
<U+202D>  And then we anchord in the winding port
<U+202D>  Near a fresh river, where the longd-for shore
<U+202D>  They all flew out to, took in victuals store,
<U+202D>  And, being full, thought of their friends, and wept
<U+202D>  Their loss by Scylla, weeping till they slept.
<U+202D>     In nights third part, when stars began to stoop,
<U+202D>  The Cloud-assembler put a tempest up.
<U+202D>  A boistrous spirit he gave it, drave out all
<U+202D>  His flocks of clouds, and let such darkness fall
<U+202D>  That Earth and Seas, for fear, to hide were drivn,
<U+202D>  For with his clouds he thrust out Night from heavn.
<U+202D>     At morn we drew our ships into a cave,
<U+202D>  In which the Nymphs that Phobus cattle drave
<U+202D>  Fair dancing-rooms had, and their seats of state.
<U+202D>  I urgd my friends then, that, to shun their fate,
<U+202D>  They would observe their oath, and take the food
<U+202D>  Our ship afforded, nor attempt the blood
<U+202D>  Of those fair herds and flocks, because they were
<U+202D>  The dreadful Gods that all could see and hear.
<U+202D>     They stood observant, and in that good mind
<U+202D>  Had we been gone; but so adverse the wind
<U+202D>  Stood to our passage, that we could not go.
<U+202D>  For one whole month perpetually did blow
<U+202D>  Impetuous Notus, not a breaths repair
<U+202D>  But his and Eurus ruld in all the air.
<U+202D>  As long yet as their ruddy wine and bread
<U+202D>  Stood out amongst them, so long not a head
<U+202D>  Of all those oxen fell in any strife
<U+202D>  Amongst those students for the gut and life;
<U+202D>  But when their victuals faild they fell to prey,
<U+202D>  Necessity compelld them then to stray
<U+202D>  In rape of fish and fowl; whatever came
<U+202D>  In reach of hand or hook, the bellys flame
<U+202D>  Afflicted to it.  I then fell to prayr,
<U+202D>  And (making to a close retreat repair,
<U+202D>  Free from both friends and winds) I washd my hands,
<U+202D>  And all the Gods besought, that held commands
<U+202D>  In liberal heavn, to yield some mean to stay
<U+202D>  Their desprate hunger, and set up the way
<U+202D>  Of our return restraind.  The Gods, instead
<U+202D>  Of giving what I prayd for--powr of deed--
<U+202D>  A deedless sleep did on my lids distill,
<U+202D>  For mean to work upon my friends their fill.
<U+202D>  For whiles I slept, there wakd no mean to curb
<U+202D>  Their headstrong wants; which he that did disturb
<U+202D>  My rule in chief at all times, and was chief
<U+202D>  To all the rest in counsel to their grief,
<U+202D>  Knew well, and of my present absence took
<U+202D>  His fit advantage, and their iron strook
<U+202D>  At highest heat.  For, feeling their desire
<U+202D>  In his own entrails, to allay the fire
<U+202D>  That Famine blew in them, he thus gave way
<U+202D>  To that affection:  Hear what I shall say,
<U+202D>  Though words will staunch no hunger, evry death
<U+202D>  To us poor wretches that draw temporal breath
<U+202D>  You know is hateful; but, all know, to die
<U+202D>  The death of Famine is a misery
<U+202D>  Past all death loathsome.  Let us, therefore, take
<U+202D>  The chief of this fair herd, and offrings make
<U+202D>  To all the Deathless that in broad heavn live,
<U+202D>  And in particular vow, if we arrive
<U+202D>  In natural Ithaca, to straight erect
<U+202D>  A temple to the Haughty-in-aspect,
<U+202D>  Rich and magnificent, and all within
<U+202D>  Deck it with relics many and divine.
<U+202D>  If yet he stands incensd, since we have slain
<U+202D>  His high-browd herd, and, therefore, will sustain
<U+202D>  Desire to wrack our ship, he is but one,
<U+202D>  And all the other Gods that we atone
<U+202D>  With our divine rites will their suffrage give
<U+202D>  To our designd return, and let us live.
<U+202D>  If not, and all take part, I rather crave
<U+202D>  To serve with one sole death the yawning wave,
<U+202D>  Than in a desert island lie and sterve,
<U+202D>  And with one pind life many deaths observe.
<U+202D>     All cried  He counsels nobly,  and all speed
<U+202D>  Made to their resolute driving; for the feed
<U+202D>  Of those coal-black, fair, broad-browd, sun-lovd beeves
<U+202D>  Had place close by our ships.  They took the lives
<U+202D>  Of sence, most eminent; about their fall
<U+202D>  Stood round, and to the States Celestial
<U+202D>  Made solemn vows; but other rites their ship
<U+202D>  Could not afford them, they did, therefore, strip
<U+202D>  The curld-head oak of fresh young leaves, to make
<U+202D>  Supply of service for their barley-cake.
<U+202D>  And on the sacredly-enflamd, for wine,
<U+202D>  Pourd purest water, all the parts divine
<U+202D>  Spitting and roasting; all the rites beside
<U+202D>  Orderly using.  Then did light divide
<U+202D>  My low and upper lids; when, my repair
<U+202D>  Made near my ship, I met the delicate air
<U+202D>  Their roast exhald; out instantly I cried,
<U+202D>  And said:  O Jove, and all ye Deified,
<U+202D>  Ye have oppressd me with a cruel sleep,
<U+202D>  While ye conferrd on me a loss as deep
<U+202D>  As Death descends to.  To themselves alone
<U+202D>  My rude men left ungovernd, they have done
<U+202D>  A deed so impious, I stand well assurd,
<U+202D>  That you will not forgive though ye procurd.
<U+202D>     Then flew Lampetié with the ample robe
<U+202D>  Up to her father with the golden globe,
<U+202D>  Ambassadress t inform him that my men
<U+202D>  Had slain his oxen.  Heart-incensed then,
<U+202D>  He cried:  Revenge me, Father, and the rest
<U+202D>  Both ever-living and for ever blest!
<U+202D>  Ulysses impious men have drawn the blood
<U+202D>  Of those my oxen that it did me good
<U+202D>  To look on, walking all my starry round,
<U+202D>  And when I trod earth all with meadows crownd.
<U+202D>  Without your full amends Ill leave heavn quite,
<U+202D>  Dis and the dead adorning with my light.
<U+202D>     The Cloud-herd answerd:  Son!  Thou shalt be ours,
<U+202D>  And light those mortals in that mine of flowrs!
<U+202D>  My red-hot flash shall graze but on their ship,
<U+202D>  And eat it, burning, in the boiling deep.
<U+202D>     This by Calypso I was told, and she
<U+202D>  Informd it from the verger Mercury.
<U+202D>     Come to our ship, I chid and told by name
<U+202D>  Each man how impiously he was to blame.
<U+202D>  But chiding got no peace, and beeves were slain!
<U+202D>  When straight the Gods forewent their following pain
<U+202D>  With dire ostents.  The hides the flesh had lost
<U+202D>  Crept all before them.  As the flesh did roast,
<U+202D>  It bellowd like the ox itself alive.
<U+202D>  And yet my soldiers did their dead beeves drive
<U+202D>  Through all these prodigies in daily feasts.
<U+202D>  Six days they banqueted and slew fresh beasts;
<U+202D>  And when the sevnth day Jove reducd the wind
<U+202D>  That all the month ragd, and so in did bind
<U+202D>  Our ship and us, was turnd and calmd, and we
<U+202D>  Launchd, put up masts, sails hoised, and to sea.
<U+202D>     The island left so far that land nowhere
<U+202D>  But only sea and sky had powr t appear,
<U+202D>  Jove fixd a cloud above our ship, so black
<U+202D>  That all the sea it darkend.  Yet from wrack
<U+202D>  She ran a good free time, till from the West
<U+202D>  Came Zephyr ruffling forth, and put his breast
<U+202D>  Out in a singing tempest, so most vast
<U+202D>  It burst the gables that made sure our mast.
<U+202D>  Our masts came tumbling down, our cattle down
<U+202D>  Rushd to the pump, and by our pilots crown
<U+202D>  The main-mast passd his fall, pashd all his skull,
<U+202D>  And all this wrack but one flaw made at full.
<U+202D>  Off from the stern the sternsman diving fell,
<U+202D>  And from his sinews flew his soul to hell.
<U+202D>  Together all this time Joves thunder chid,
<U+202D>  And through and through the ship his lightning glid,
<U+202D>  Till it embracd her round; her bulk was filld
<U+202D>  With nasty sulphur, and her men were killd,
<U+202D>  Tumbled to sea, like sea-mews swum about,
<U+202D>  And there the date of their return was out.
<U+202D>     I tossd from side to side still, till all-broke
<U+202D>  Her ribs were with the storm, and she did choke
<U+202D>  With let-in surges; for the mast torn down
<U+202D>  Tore her up piecemeal, and for me to drown
<U+202D>  Left little undissolvd.  But to the mast
<U+202D>  There was a leather thong left, which I cast
<U+202D>  About it and the keel, and so sat tost
<U+202D>  With baneful weather, till the West had lost
<U+202D>  His stormy tyranny.  And then arose
<U+202D>  The South, that bred me more abhorréd woes;
<U+202D>  For back again his blasts expelld me quite
<U+202D>  On ravenous Charybdis.  All that night
<U+202D>  I totterd up and down, till Light and I
<U+202D>  At Scyllas rock encounterd, and the nigh
<U+202D>  Dreadful Charybdis.  As I drave on these,
<U+202D>  I saw Charybdis supping up the seas,
<U+202D>  And had gone up together, if the tree
<U+202D>  That bore the wild figs had not rescued me;
<U+202D>  To which I leapd, and left my keel, and high
<U+202D>  Chambring upon it did as close imply
<U+202D>  My breast about it as a reremouse could;
<U+202D>  Yet might my feet on no stub fasten hold
<U+202D>  To ease my hands, the roots were crept so low
<U+202D>  Beneath the earth, and so aloft did grow
<U+202D>  The far-spread arms that, though good height I gat,
<U+202D>  I could not reach them.  To the main bole flat
<U+202D>  I, therefore, still must cling; till up again
<U+202D>  She belchd my mast, and after that amain
<U+202D>  My keel came tumbling.  So at length it chancd
<U+202D>  To me, as to a judge that long advancd
<U+202D>  To judge a sort of hot young fellows jars,
<U+202D>  At length time frees him from their civil wars,
<U+202D>  When glad he riseth and to dinner goes;
<U+202D>  So time, at length, releasd with joys my woes,
<U+202D>  And from Charybdis mouth appeard my keel.
<U+202D>  To which, my hand now loosd and now my heel,
<U+202D>  I altogether with a huge noise droppd,
<U+202D>  Just in her midst fell, where the mast was proppd,
<U+202D>  And there rowd off with owers of my hands.
<U+202D>  God and mans Father would not from her sands
<U+202D>  Let Scylla see me, for I then had died
<U+202D>  That bitter death that my poor friends supplied.
<U+202D>     Nine days at sea I hoverd; the tenth night
<U+202D>  In th isle Ogygia, where, about the bright
<U+202D>  And right renownd Calypso, I was cast
<U+202D>  By powr of Deity; where I lived embracd
<U+202D>  With love and feasts.  But why should I relate
<U+202D>  Those kind occurrents?  I should iterate
<U+202D>  What I in part to your chaste queen and you
<U+202D>  So late imparted.  And, for me to grow
<U+202D>  A talker-over of my tale again,
<U+202D>  Were past my free contentment to sustain.
