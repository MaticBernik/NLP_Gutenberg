<U+202D>[1] The continued piety of Ulysses through all places, times, and
<U+202D>occasions.
<U+202D>[2] Since the Phaacians were not only dwellers by sea, but studious
<U+202D>also of sea qualities, their names seem to usurp their faculties
<U+202D>therein.  All consisting of sea-faring signification, except
<U+202D>Laodamas, As Acroneus, _summa seu extrema navis pars._

<U+202D>[5] He names Laodamas only for all the other brothers; since in his
<U+202D>exception, the others envies were curbed:  for brothers either are
<U+202D>or should be of one acceptation in all fit things, And Laodamas, he
<U+202D>calls his host, being eldest son to Alcinous:  the heir being ever the
<U+202D>young master; nor might he conveniently prefer Alcinous in his
<U+202D>exception, since he stood not in competition at these contentions.

<U+202D>[10] As by the divine fury directly inspired so, for Ulysses glory.
<U+202D>[11] In that the slaughters he made were expressed so lively.

<U+202D>soever in these times assured, yet in those ages they were neither
<U+202D>absurd nor strange.  Those inanimate things having (it seemed)
<U+202D>certain Genii, in whose powers they supposed their ships faculties.
<U+202D>As others have affirmed oaks to have sense of hearing; and so the
<U+202D>ship of Argos was said to have a mast made of Dodonean oak, that
<U+202D>was vocal, and could speak.

<U+202D>  THE NINTH BOOK OF HOMERS ODYSSEYS
<U+202D>  THE ARGUMENT
<U+202D>  Ulysses here is first made known;
<U+202D>  Who tells the stern contention
<U+202D>  His powrs did gainst the Cicons try;
<U+202D>  And thence to the Lotophagi
<U+202D>  Extends his conquest; and from them
<U+202D>  Assays the Cyclop Polypheme,
<U+202D>  And, by the crafts his wits apply,
<U+202D>  He puts him out his only eye.
<U+202D>  ANOTHER ARGUMENT
<U+202D>  _<U+1FBF><U+0399><U+03C9><U+0311><U+03C4><U+03B1>._
<U+202D>     The strangely fed
<U+202D>        Lotophagi.
<U+202D>     The Cicons fled.
<U+202D>        The Cyclops eye.
<U+202D>  Ulysses thus resolvd the kings demands:
<U+202D>     Alcinous, in whom this empire stands,
<U+202D>  You should not of so natural right disherit
<U+202D>  Your princely feast, as take from it the spirit.
<U+202D>  To hear a poet, that in accent brings
<U+202D>  The Gods breasts down, and breathes them as he sings,
<U+202D>  Is sweet, and sacred; nor can I conceive,
<U+202D>  In any common-weal, what more doth give
<U+202D>  Note of the just and blessed empery,
<U+202D>  Than to see comfort universally
<U+202D>  Cheer up the people, when in evry roof
<U+202D>  She gives observers a most human proof
<U+202D>  Of mens contents. To see a neighbours feast
<U+202D>  Adorn it through; and thereat hear the breast
<U+202D>  Of the divine Muse; men in order set;
<U+202D>  A wine-page waiting; tables crownd with meat,
<U+202D>  Set close to guests that are to use it skilld;
<U+202D>  The cup-boards furnishd, and the cups still filld;
<U+202D>  This shows, to my mind, most humanely fair.
<U+202D>  Nor should you, for me, still the heavnly air,
<U+202D>  That stirrd my soul so; for I love such tears
<U+202D>  As fall from fit notes, beaten through mine ears
<U+202D>  With repetitions of what heavn hath done,
<U+202D>  And break from hearty apprehensión
<U+202D>  Of God and goodness, though they show my ill.
<U+202D>  And therefore doth my mind excite me still,
<U+202D>  To tell my bleeding moan; but much more now,
<U+202D>  To serve your pleasure, that to over-flow
<U+202D>  My tears with such cause may by sighs be drivn,
<U+202D>  Though neer so much plagued I may seem by heavn.
<U+202D>     And now my name; which way shall lead to all
<U+202D>  My misries after, that their sounds may fall
<U+202D>  Through your ears also, and show (having fled
<U+202D>  So much affliction) first, who rests his head
<U+202D>  In your embraces, when, so far from home,
<U+202D>  I knew not where t obtain it resting room.
<U+202D>     I am Ulysses Laertiades,
<U+202D>  The fear of all the world for policies,
<U+202D>  For which my facts as high as heavn resound.
<U+202D>  I dwell in Ithaca, earths most renownd,
<U+202D>  All over-shadowd with the shake-leaf hill,  [1]
<U+202D>  Tree-famd Neritus; whose near confines fill
<U+202D>  Islands a number, well-inhabited,
<U+202D>  That under my observance taste their bread;
<U+202D>  Dulichius, Samos, and the full-of-food  [2]
<U+202D>  Zacynthus, likewise gracd with store of wood.
<U+202D>  But Ithaca, though in the seas it lie,
<U+202D>  Yet lies she so aloft she casts her eye
<U+202D>  Quite over all the neighbour continent;
<U+202D>  Far northward situate, and, being lent
<U+202D>  But little favour of the morn and sun,
<U+202D>  With barren rocks and cliffs is over-run;
<U+202D>  And yet of hardy youths a nurse of name;
<U+202D>  Nor could I see a soil, whereer I came,
<U+202D>  More sweet and wishful.  Yet, from hence was I
<U+202D>  Withheld with horror by the Deity,
<U+202D>  Divine Calypso, in her cavy house,
<U+202D>  Enflamd to make me her sole lord and spouse.
<U+202D>  Circe Aaa too, that knowing dame,
<U+202D>  Whose veins the like affections did enflame,
<U+202D>  Detaind me likewise.  But to neithers love
<U+202D>  Could I be tempted;  which doth well approve,
<U+202D>  Nothing so sweet is as our countrys earth,  [3]
<U+202D>  And joy of those from whom we claim our birth.
<U+202D>  Though roofs far richer we far off possess,
<U+202D>  Yet, from our native, all our more is less.
<U+202D>     To which as I contended, I will tell
<U+202D>  The much-distress-conferring facts that fell
<U+202D>  By Joves divine prevention, since I set
<U+202D>  From ruind Troy my first foot in retreat.
<U+202D>     From Ilion ill winds cast me on the coast
<U+202D>  The Cicons hold, where I employd mine host
<U+202D>  For Ismarus, a city built just by
<U+202D>  My place of landing; of which victory
<U+202D>  Made me expugner.  I depeopled it,
<U+202D>  Slew all the men, and did their wives remit,
<U+202D>  With much spoil taken; which we did divide,
<U+202D>  That none might need his part.  I then applied
<U+202D>  All speed for flight; but my command therein,
<U+202D>  Fools that they were, could no observance win
<U+202D>  Of many soldiers, who, with spoil fed high,
<U+202D>  Would yet fill higher, and excessively
<U+202D>  Fell to their wine, gave slaughter on the shore
<U+202D>  Clovn-footed beeves and sheep in mighty store.
<U+202D>  In mean space, Cicons did to Cicons cry,
<U+202D>  When, of their nearest dwellers, instantly
<U+202D>  Many and better soldiers made strong head,
<U+202D>  That held the continent, and managéd
<U+202D>  Their horse with high skill, on which they would fight,
<U+202D>  When fittest cause servd, and again alight,
<U+202D>  With soon seen vantage, and on foot contend.
<U+202D>  Their concourse swift was, and had never end;
<U+202D>  As thick and sudden twas, as flowrs and leaves
<U+202D>  Dark spring discovers, when she light receives.  [4]
<U+202D>  And then began the bitter Fate of Jove
<U+202D>  To alter us unhappy, which evn strove
<U+202D>  To give us suffrance.  At our fleet we made
<U+202D>  Enforcéd stand; and there did they invade
<U+202D>  Our thrust-up forces; darts encounterd darts,
<U+202D>  With blows on both sides; either making parts
<U+202D>  Good upon either, while the morning shone,
<U+202D>  And sacred day her bright increase held on,
<U+202D>  Though much out-matchd in number; but as soon
<U+202D>  As Phobus westward fell, the Cicons won
<U+202D>  Much hand of us; six proved soldiers fell,
<U+202D>  Of evry ship, the rest they did compel!
<U+202D>  To seek of Flight escape from Death and Fate.
