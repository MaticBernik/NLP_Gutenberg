an ambiguous oath, should they be necessary to save him from a villain.

BOOK XX
ARGUMENT
Ulysses, doubting whether he shall destroy or not the women servants who
commit lewdness with the suitors, resolves at length to spare them for
the present. He asks an omen from Jupiter, and that he would grant him
also to hear some propitious words from the lips of one in the family.
His petitions are both answered. Preparation is made for the feast.
Whilst the suitors sit at table, Pallas smites them with a horrid frenzy.
Theoclymenus, observing the strange effects of it, prophesies their
destruction, and they deride his prophecy.
    But in the vestibule the Hero lay
    On a bull's-hide undress'd, o'er which he spread
    The fleece of many a sheep slain by the Greeks,
    And, cover'd by the household's governess
    With a wide cloak, composed himself to rest.
    Yet slept he not, but meditating lay
    Woe to his enemies. Meantime, the train
    Of women, wonted to the suitors' arms,
    Issuing all mirth and laughter, in his soul
    A tempest raised of doubts, whether at once                       10
    To slay, or to permit them yet to give
    Their lusty paramours one last embrace.
    As growls the mastiff standing on the start
    For battle, if a stranger's foot approach
    Her cubs new-whelp'd--so growl'd Ulysses' heart,
    While wonder fill'd him at their impious deeds.
    But, smiting on his breast, thus he reproved
    The mutinous inhabitant within.
      Heart! bear it. Worse than this thou didst endure
    When, uncontroulable by force of man,                             20
    The Cyclops thy illustrious friends devour'd.
    Thy patience then fail'd not, till prudence found
    Deliv'rance for thee on the brink of fate.
      So disciplined the Hero his own heart,
    Which, tractable, endured the rigorous curb,
    And patient; yet he turn'd from side to side.
    As when some hungry swain turns oft a maw
    Unctuous and sav'ry on the burning coals,
    Quick expediting his desired repast,
    So he from side to side roll'd, pond'ring deep                    30
    How likeliest with success he might assail
    Those shameless suitors; one to many opposed.
    Then, sudden from the skies descending, came
    Minerva in a female form; her stand
    Above his head she took, and thus she spake.
      Why sleep'st thou not, unhappiest of mankind?
    Thou art at home; here dwells thy wife, and here
    Thy son; a son, whom all might wish their own.
      Then her Ulysses answer'd, ever-wise.
    O Goddess! true is all that thou hast said,                       40
    But, not without anxiety, I muse
    How, single as I am, I shall assail
    Those shameless suitors who frequent my courts
    Daily; and always their whole multitude.
    This weightier theme I meditate beside;
    Should I, with Jove's concurrence and with thine
    Prevail to slay them, how shall I escape,
    Myself, at last?[88] oh Goddess, weigh it well.
      Him answer'd then Pallas caerulean-eyed.
    Oh faithless man! a man will in his friend                        50
    Confide, though mortal, and in valour less
    And wisdom than himself; but I who keep
    Thee in all difficulties, am divine.
    I tell thee plainly. Were we hemm'd around
    By fifty troops of shouting warriors bent
    To slay thee, thou should'st yet securely drive
    The flocks away and cattle of them all.
    But yield to sleep's soft influence; for to lie
    All night thus watchful, is, itself, distress.
    Fear not. Deliv'rance waits, not far remote.                      60
      So saying, she o'er Ulysses' eyes diffused
    Soft slumbers, and when sleep that sooths the mind
    And nerves the limbs afresh had seized him once,
    To the Olympian summit swift return'd.
    But his chaste spouse awoke; she weeping sat
    On her soft couch, and, noblest of her sex,
    Satiate at length with tears, her pray'r address'd
    First to Diana of the Pow'rs above.
      Diana, awful progeny of Jove!
    I would that with a shaft this moment sped                        70
    Into my bosom, thou would'st here conclude
    My mournful life! or, oh that, as it flies,
    Snatching me through the pathless air, a storm
    Would whelm me deep in Ocean's restless tide!
    So, when the Gods their parents had destroy'd,
    Storms suddenly the beauteous daughters snatch'd[89]
    Of Pandarus away; them left forlorn
    Venus with curds, with honey and with wine
    Fed duly; Juno gave them to surpass
    All women in the charms of face and mind,                         80
    With graceful stature eminent the chaste
    Diana bless'd them, and in works of art
    Illustrious, Pallas taught them to excel.
    But when the foam-sprung Goddess to the skies
    A suitress went on their behalf, to obtain
    Blest nuptials for them from the Thund'rer Jove,
    (For Jove the happiness, himself, appoints,
    And the unhappiness of all below)
    Meantime, the Harpies ravishing away
    Those virgins, gave them to the Furies Three,                     90
    That they might serve them. O that me the Gods
    Inhabiting Olympus so would hide
    From human eyes for ever, or bright-hair'd
    Diana pierce me with a shaft, that while
    Ulysses yet engages all my thoughts,
    My days concluded, I might 'scape the pain
    Of gratifying some inferior Chief!
    This is supportable, when (all the day
    To sorrow giv'n) the mourner sleeps at night;
    For sleep, when it hath once the eyelids veil'd,                 100
    All reminiscence blots of all alike,
    Both good and ill; but me the Gods afflict
    Not seldom ev'n in dreams, and at my side,
    This night again, one lay resembling him;
    Such as my own Ulysses when he join'd
    Achaia's warriors; my exulting heart
    No airy dream believed it, but a truth.
      While thus she spake, in orient gold enthroned
    Came forth the morn; Ulysses, as she wept,
    Heard plain her lamentation; him that sound                      110
    Alarm'd; he thought her present, and himself
    Known to her. Gath'ring hastily the cloak
    His cov'ring, and the fleeces, them he placed
    Together on a throne within the hall,
    But bore the bull's-hide forth into the air.
    Then, lifting high his hands to Jove, he pray'd.
      Eternal Sire! if over moist and dry
    Ye have with good-will sped me to my home
    After much suff'ring, grant me from the lips
    Of some domestic now awake, to hear                              120
    Words of propitious omen, and thyself
    Vouchsafe me still some other sign abroad.
      Such pray'r he made, and Jove omniscient heard.
    Sudden he thunder'd from the radiant heights
    Olympian; glad, Ulysses heard the sound.
    A woman, next, a labourer at the mill
    Hard by, where all the palace-mills were wrought,
    Gave him the omen of propitious sound.
    Twelve maidens, day by day, toil'd at the mills,
    Meal grinding, some, of barley, some, of wheat,                  130
    Marrow of man.[90] The rest (their portion ground)
    All slept; she only from her task as yet
    Ceas'd not, for she was feeblest of them all;
    She rested on her mill, and thus pronounced
    The happy omen by her Lord desired.
      Jove, Father, Governor of heav'n and earth!
    Loud thou hast thunder'd from the starry skies
    By no cloud veil'd; a sign propitious, giv'n
    To whom I know not; but oh grant the pray'r
    Of a poor bond-woman! appoint their feast                        140
    This day, the last that in Ulysses' house
    The suitors shall enjoy, for whom I drudge,
    With aching heart and trembling knees their meal
    Grinding continual. Feast they here no more!
      She ended, and the list'ning Chief received
    With equal joy both signs; for well he hoped
    That he should punish soon those guilty men.
    And now the other maidens in the hall
    Assembling, kindled on the hearth again
    Th' unwearied blaze; then, godlike from his couch                150
    Arose Telemachus, and, fresh-attired,
    Athwart his shoulders his bright faulchion slung,
    Bound his fair sandals to his feet, and took
    His sturdy spear pointed with glitt'ring brass;
    Advancing to the portal, there he stood,
    And Euryclea thus, his nurse, bespake.
      Nurse! have ye with respectful notice serv'd
    Our guest? or hath he found a sordid couch
    E'en where he might? for, prudent though she be,
    My mother, inattentive oft, the worse                            160
    Treats kindly, and the better sends away.
      Whom Euryclea answer'd, thus, discrete.
    Blame not, my son! who merits not thy blame.
    The guest sat drinking till he would no more,
    And ate, till, question'd, he replied--Enough.
    But when the hour of sleep call'd him to rest,
    She gave commandment to her female train
    To spread his couch. Yet he, like one forlorn,
    And, through despair, indiff'rent to himself,
    Both bed and rugs refused, and in the porch                      170
    On skins of sheep and on an undress'd hide
    Reposed, where we threw cov'ring over him.
      She ceas'd, and, grasping his bright-headed spear,
    Forth went the Prince attended, as he went,
    By his fleet hounds; to the assembled Greeks
    In council with majestic gait he moved,
    And Euryclea, daughter wise of Ops,
    Pisenor's son, call'd to the serving-maids.
      Haste ye! be diligent! sweep the palace-floor
    And sprinkle it; then give the sumptuous seats                   180
    Their purple coverings. Let others cleanse
    With sponges all the tables, wash and rince
    The beakers well, and goblets rich-emboss'd;
    Run others to the fountain, and bring thence
    Water with speed. The suitors will not long
    Be absent, but will early come to-day,
    For this day is a public festival.[91]
      So she; whom all, obedient, heard; forth went
    Together, twenty to the crystal fount,
    While in their sev'ral provinces the rest                        190
    Bestirr'd them brisk at home. Then enter'd all
    The suitors, and began cleaving the wood.
    Meantime, the women from the fountain came,
    Whom soon the swine-herd follow'd, driving three
    His fattest brawns; them in the spacious court
    He feeding left, and to Ulysses' side
    Approaching, courteously bespake the Chief.
      Guest! look the Greecians on thee with respect
    At length, or still disdainful as before?
      Then, answer thus Ulysses wise return'd.                       200
    Yes--and I would that vengeance from the Gods
    Might pay their insolence, who in a house
    Not theirs, dominion exercise, and plan
    Unseemly projects, shameless as they are!
      Thus they conferr'd; and now Melanthius came
    The goat-herd, driving, with the aid of two
    His fellow-swains, the fattest of his goats
    To feast the suitors. In the sounding porch
    The goats he tied, then, drawing near, in terms
    Reproachful thus assail'd Ulysses' ear.                          210
      How, stranger? persever'st thou, begging, still
    To vex the suitors? wilt thou not depart?
    Scarce shall we settle this dispute, I judge,
    Till we have tasted each the other's fist;
    Thou art unreasonable thus to beg
    Here always--have the Greeks no feasts beside?
      He spake, to whom Ulysses answer none
    Return'd, but shook his brows, and, silent, framed
    Terrible purposes. Then, third, approach'd
    Chief o'er the herds, Philoetius; fatted goats                   220
    He for the suitors brought, with which he drove
    An heifer; (ferry-men had pass'd them o'er,
    Carriers of all who on their coast arrive)
    He tied them in the sounding porch, then stood
    Beside the swine-herd, to whom thus he said.
      Who is this guest, Eumaeus, here arrived
    So lately? from what nation hath he come?
    What parentage and country boasts the man?
    I pity him, whose figure seems to speak
    Royalty in him. Heav'n will surely plunge                        230
    The race of common wand'rers deep in woe,
    If thus it destine even Kings to mourn.
      He ceas'd; and, with his right hand, drawing nigh,
    Welcom'd Ulysses, whom he thus bespake.
      Hail venerable guest! and be thy lot
    Prosp'rous at least hereafter, who art held
    At present in the bonds of num'rous ills.
    Thou, Jupiter, of all the Gods, art most
    Severe, and spar'st not to inflict distress
    Even on creatures from thyself derived.[92]                      240
    I had no sooner mark'd thee, than my eyes
    Swam, and the sweat gush'd from me at the thought
    Of dear Ulysses; for if yet he live
    And see the sun, such tatters, I suppose,
    He wears, a wand'rer among human-kind.
    But if already with the dead he dwell
    In Pluto's drear abode, oh then, alas
    For kind Ulysses! who consign'd to me,
    While yet a boy, his Cephalenian herds,
    And they have now encreas'd to such a store                      250
    Innumerable of broad-fronted beeves,
    As only care like mine could have produced.
    These, by command of others, I transport
    For their regale, who neither heed his son,
    Nor tremble at the anger of the Gods,
    But long have wish'd ardently to divide
    And share the substance of our absent Lord.
    Me, therefore, this thought occupies, and haunts
    My mind not seldom; while the heir survives
    It were no small offence to drive his herds                      260
    Afar, and migrate to a foreign land;
    Yet here to dwell, suff'ring oppressive wrongs
    While I attend another's beeves, appears
    Still less supportable; and I had fled,
    And I had served some other mighty Chief
    Long since, (for patience fails me to endure
    My present lot) but that I cherish still
    Some hope of my ill-fated Lord's return,
    To rid his palace of those lawless guests.
      To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied.                           270
    Herdsman! since neither void of sense thou seem'st,
    Nor yet dishonest, but myself am sure
    That thou art owner of a mind discrete,
    Hear therefore, for I swear! bold I attest
    Jove and this hospitable board, and these
    The Lares[93] of the noble Chief, whose hearth
    Protects me now, that, ere thy going hence,
    Ulysses surely shall have reach'd his home,
    And thou shalt see him, if thou wilt, thyself,
    Slaying the suitors who now lord it here.                        280
      Him answer'd then the keeper of his beeves.
    Oh stranger! would but the Saturnian King
    Perform that word, thou should'st be taught (thyself
    Eye-witness of it) what an arm is mine.
      Eumaeus also ev'ry power of heav'n
    Entreated, that Ulysses might possess
    His home again. Thus mutual they conferr'd.
      Meantime, in conf'rence close the suitors plann'd
    Death for Telemachus; but while they sat
    Consulting, on their left the bird of Jove                       290
    An eagle soar'd, grasping a tim'rous dove.
    Then, thus, Amphinomus the rest bespake.
      Oh friends! our consultation how to slay
    Telemachus, will never smoothly run
    To its effect; but let us to the feast.
      So spake Amphinomus, whose counsel pleased.
    Then, all into the royal house repaired,
    And on the thrones and couches throwing off
    Their mantles, slew the fatted goats, the brawns,
    The sheep full-sized, and heifer of the herd.                    300
    The roasted entrails first they shared, then fill'd
    The beakers, and the swine-herd placed the cups,
    Philoetius, chief intendant of the beeves,
    Served all with baskets elegant of bread,
    While all their cups Melanthius charged with wine,
    And they assail'd at once the ready feast.
    Meantime Telemachus, with forecast shrewd,
    Fast by the marble threshold, but within
    The spacious hall his father placed, to whom
    A sordid seat he gave and scanty board.                          310
    A portion of the entrails, next, he set
    Before him, fill'd a golden goblet high,
    And thus, in presence of them all, began.
      There seated now, drink as the suitors drink.
    I will, myself, their biting taunts forbid,
    And violence. This edifice is mine,
    Not public property; my father first
    Possess'd it, and my right from him descends.
    Suitors! controul your tongues, nor with your hands
    Offend, lest contest fierce and war ensue.                       320
      He ceas'd: they gnawing, sat, their lips, aghast
    With wonder that Telemachus in his speech
    Such boldness used. Then spake Eupithes' son,
    Antinoues, and the assembly thus address'd.
      Let pass, ye Greeks! the language of the Prince,
    Harsh as it is, and big with threats to us.
    Had Jove permitted, his orations here,
    Although thus eloquent, ere now had ceased.
      So spake Antinoues, whom Ulysses' son
    Heard unconcern'd. And now the heralds came                      330
    In solemn pomp, conducting through the streets
    A sacred hecatomb, when in the grove
    Umbrageous of Apollo, King shaft-arm'd,
    The assembled Greecians met. The sav'ry roast
    Finish'd, and from the spits withdrawn, each shared
    His portion of the noble feast, and such
    As they enjoy'd themselves the attendants placed
    Before Ulysses, for the Hero's son
    Himself, Telemachus, had so enjoined.
    But Pallas (that they might exasp'rate more                      340
    Ulysses) suffer'd not the suitor Chiefs
    To banquet, guiltless of heart-piercing scoffs
    Malign. There was a certain suitor named
    Ctesippus, born in Samos; base of mind
    Was he and profligate, but, in the wealth
    Confiding of his father, woo'd the wife
    Of long-exiled Ulysses. From his seat
    The haughty suitors thus that man address'd.
      Ye noble suitors, I would speak; attend!
    The guest is served; he hath already shared                      350
    Equal with us; nor less the laws demand
    Of hospitality; for neither just
    It were nor decent, that a guest, received
    Here by Telemachus, should be denied
    His portion of the feast. Come then--myself
    Will give to him, that he may also give
    To her who laved him in the bath, or else
    To whatsoever menial here he will.
      So saying, he from a basket near at hand
    Heav'd an ox-foot, and with a vig'rous arm                       360
    Hurl'd it. Ulysses gently bow'd his head,
    Shunning the blow, but gratified his just
    Resentment with a broad sardonic smile[94]
    Of dread significance. He smote the wall.
    Then thus Telemachus rebuked the deed.
      Ctesippus, thou art fortunate; the bone
    Struck not the stranger, for he shunn'd the blow;
    Else, I had surely thrust my glitt'ring lance
    Right through thee; then, no hymenaeal rites
    Of thine should have employ'd thy father here,                   370
    But thy funereal. No man therefore treat
    Me with indignity within these walls,
    For though of late a child, I can discern
    Now, and distinguish between good and ill.
    Suffice it that we patiently endure
    To be spectators daily of our sheep
    Slaughter'd, our bread consumed, our stores of wine
    Wasted; for what can one to all opposed?
    Come then--persist no longer in offence
    And hostile hate of me; or if ye wish                            380
    To slay me, pause not. It were better far
    To die, and I had rather much be slain,
    Than thus to witness your atrocious deeds
    Day after day; to see our guests abused,
    With blows insulted, and the women dragg'd
    With a licentious violence obscene
    From side to side of all this fair abode.
      He said, and all sat silent, till at length
    Thus Agelaues spake, Diastor's son.
      My friends! let none with contradiction thwart                 390
    And rude reply, words rational and just;
    Assault no more the stranger, nor of all
    The servants of renown'd Ulysses here
    Harm any. My advice, both to the Queen
    And to Telemachus, shall gentle be,
    May it but please them. While the hope survived
    Within your bosoms of the safe return
    Of wise Ulysses to his native isle,
    So long good reason was that she should use
    Delay, and hold our wooing in suspence;                          400
    For had Ulysses come, that course had proved
    Wisest and best; but that he comes no more
    Appears, now, manifest. Thou, therefore, Prince!
    Seeking thy mother, counsel her to wed
    The noblest, and who offers richest dow'r,
    That thou, for thy peculiar, may'st enjoy
    Thy own inheritance in peace and ease,
    And she, departing, find another home.
      To whom Telemachus, discrete, replied.
    I swear by Jove, and by my father's woes,                        410
    Who either hath deceased far from his home,
    Or lives a wand'rer, that I interpose
    No hindrance to her nuptials. Let her wed
    Who offers most, and even whom she will.
    But to dismiss her rudely were a deed
    Unfilial--That I dare not--God forbid!
      So spake Telemachus. Then Pallas struck
    The suitors with delirium; wide they stretch'd
    Their jaws with unspontaneous laughter loud;
    Their meat dripp'd blood; tears fill'd their eyes, and dire
    Presages of approaching woe, their hearts.                       421
    Then thus the prophet Theoclymenus.[95]
      Ah miserable men! what curse is this
    That takes you now? night wraps itself around
    Your faces, bodies, limbs; the palace shakes
    With peals of groans--and oh, what floods ye weep!
    I see the walls and arches dappled thick
    With gore; the vestibule is throng'd, the court
    On all sides throng'd with apparitions grim
    Of slaughter'd men sinking into the gloom                        430
    Of Erebus; the sun is blotted out
    From heav'n, and midnight whelms you premature.
      He said, they, hearing, laugh'd; and thus the son
    Of Polybus, Eurymachus replied.
      This wand'rer from a distant shore hath left
    His wits behind. Hoa there! conduct him hence
    Into the forum; since he dreams it night
    Already, teach him there that it is day.
      Then answer'd godlike Theoclymenus.
    I have no need, Eurymachus, of guides                            440
    To lead me hence, for I have eyes and ears,
    The use of both my feet, and of a mind
    In no respect irrational or wild.
    These shall conduct me forth, for well I know
    That evil threatens you, such, too, as none
    Shall 'scape of all the suitors, whose delight
    Is to insult the unoffending guest
    Received beneath this hospitable roof.
      He said, and, issuing from the palace, sought
    Piraeus' house, who gladly welcom'd him.                          450
    Then all the suitors on each other cast
    A look significant, and, to provoke
    Telemachus the more, fleer'd at his guests.
    Of whom a youth thus, insolent began.
      No living wight, Telemachus, had e'er
    Guests such as thine. Witness, we know not who,
    This hungry vagabond, whose means of life
    Are none, and who hath neither skill nor force
    To earn them, a mere burthen on the ground.
    Witness the other also, who upstarts                             460
    A prophet suddenly. Take my advice;
    I counsel wisely; send them both on board
    Some gallant bark to Sicily for sale;
    Thus shall they somewhat profit thee at last.
      So spake the suitors, whom Telemachus
    Heard unconcern'd, and, silent, look'd and look'd
    Toward his father, watching still the time
    When he should punish that licentious throng.
    Meantime, Icarius' daughter, who had placed
    Her splendid seat opposite, heard distinct                       470
    Their taunting speeches. They, with noisy mirth,
    Feasted deliciously, for they had slain
    Many a fat victim; but a sadder feast
    Than, soon, the Goddess and the warrior Chief
    Should furnish for them, none shall ever share.
    Of which their crimes had furnish'd first the cause.
