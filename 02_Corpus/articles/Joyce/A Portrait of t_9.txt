--Simon, said Mrs Dedalus, you haven't given Mrs Riordan any sauce.
Mr Dedalus seized the sauceboat.
--Haven't I? he cried. Mrs Riordan, pity the poor blind. Dante covered
her plate with her hands and said:
--No, thanks.
Mr Dedalus turned to uncle Charles.
--How are you off, sir?
--Right as the mail, Simon.
--You, John?
--I'm all right. Go on yourself.
--Mary? Here, Stephen, here's something to make your hair curl.
He poured sauce freely over Stephen's plate and set the boat again on
the table. Then he asked uncle Charles was it tender. Uncle Charles
could not speak because his mouth was full; but he nodded that it was.
--That was a good answer our friend made to the canon. What? said Mr
Dedalus.
--I didn't think he had that much in him, said Mr Casey.
--I'LL PAY YOUR DUES, FATHER, WHEN YOU CEASE TURNING THE HOUSE OF GOD
INTO A POLLING-BOOTH.
--A nice answer, said Dante, for any man calling himself a catholic to
give to his priest.
--They have only themselves to blame, said Mr Dedalus suavely. If they
took a fool's advice they would confine their attention to religion.
--It is religion, Dante said. They are doing their duty in warning the
people.
--We go to the house of God, Mr Casey said, in all humility to pray to
our Maker and not to hear election addresses.
--It is religion, Dante said again. They are right. They must direct
their flocks.
--And preach politics from the altar, is it? asked Mr Dedalus.
--Certainly, said Dante. It is a question of public morality. A priest
would not be a priest if he did not tell his flock what is right and
what is wrong.
Mrs Dedalus laid down her knife and fork, saying:
--For pity sake and for pity sake let us have no political discussion
on this day of all days in the year.
--Quite right, ma'am, said uncle Charles. Now, Simon, that's quite
enough now. Not another word now.
--Yes, yes, said Mr Dedalus quickly.
He uncovered the dish boldly and said:
--Now then, who's for more turkey?
Nobody answered. Dante said:
--Nice language for any catholic to use!
--Mrs Riordan, I appeal to you, said Mrs Dedalus, to let the matter
drop now.
Dante turned on her and said:
--And am I to sit here and listen to the pastors of my church being
flouted?
--Nobody is saying a word against them, said Mr Dedalus, so long as
they don't meddle in politics.
--The bishops and priests of Ireland have spoken, said Dante, and they
must be obeyed.
--Let them leave politics alone, said Mr Casey, or the people may
leave their church alone.
--You hear? said Dante, turning to Mrs Dedalus.
--Mr Casey! Simon! said Mrs Dedalus, let it end now.
--Too bad! Too bad! said uncle Charles.
--What? cried Mr Dedalus. Were we to desert him at the bidding of the
English people?
--He was no longer worthy to lead, said Dante. He was a public sinner.
