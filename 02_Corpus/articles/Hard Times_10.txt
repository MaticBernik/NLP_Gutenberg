He frightened me so, said the girl, with his cruel faces!
Oh! cried Bitzer.  Oh!  Ant you one of the rest!  Ant you a
horse-rider!  I never looked at her, sir.  I asked her if she would know
how to define a horse to-morrow, and offered to tell her again, and she
ran away, and I ran after her, sir, that she might know how to answer
when she was asked.  You wouldnt have thought of saying such mischief if
you hadnt been a horse-rider?
Her calling seems to be pretty well known among em, observed Mr.
Bounderby.  Youd have had the whole school peeping in a row, in a
week.
Truly, I think so, returned his friend.  Bitzer, turn you about and
take yourself home. Jupe, stay here a moment.  Let me hear of your
running in this manner any more, boy, and you will hear of me through the
master of the school.  You understand what I mean.  Go along.
The boy stopped in his rapid blinking, knuckled his forehead again,
glanced at Sissy, turned about, and retreated.
Now, girl, said Mr. Gradgrind, take this gentleman and me to your
fathers; we are going there.  What have you got in that bottle you are
carrying?
Gin, said Mr. Bounderby.
Dear, no, sir!  Its the nine oils.
The what? cried Mr. Bounderby.
The nine oils, sir, to rub father with.
Then, said Mr. Bounderby, with a loud short laugh, what the devil do
you rub your father with nine oils for?
Its what our people aways use, sir, when they get any hurts in the
ring, replied the girl, looking over her shoulder, to assure herself
that her pursuer was gone.  They bruise themselves very bad sometimes.
Serve em right, said Mr. Bounderby, for being idle.  She glanced up
at his face, with mingled astonishment and dread.
By George! said Mr. Bounderby, when I was four or five years younger
than you, I had worse bruises upon me than ten oils, twenty oils, forty
oils, would have rubbed off.  I didnt get em by posture-making, but by
being banged about.  There was no rope-dancing for me; I danced on the
bare ground and was larruped with the rope.
Mr. Gradgrind, though hard enough, was by no means so rough a man as Mr.
Bounderby.  His character was not unkind, all things considered; it might
have been a very kind one indeed, if he had only made some round mistake
in the arithmetic that balanced it, years ago.  He said, in what he meant
for a reassuring tone, as they turned down a narrow road, And this is
Pods End; is it, Jupe?
This is it, sir, andif you wouldnt mind, sirthis is the house.
She stopped, at twilight, at the door of a mean little public-house, with
dim red lights in it.  As haggard and as shabby, as if, for want of
custom, it had itself taken to drinking, and had gone the way all
drunkards go, and was very near the end of it.
