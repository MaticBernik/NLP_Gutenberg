_Luce._ [_Within_] What a coil is there, Dromio? who are
        those at the gate?
_Dro. E._ Let my master in, Luce.
_Luce._                [_Within_] Faith, no; he comes too late;
And so tell your master.
_Dro. E._          O Lord, I must laugh!                            50
Have at you with a proverb;--Shall I set in my staff?
_Luce._ [_Within_] Have at you with another; that's,
       --When? can you tell?
_Dro. S._ [_Within_] If thy name be call'd Luce, --Luce,
        thou hast answer'd him well.
_Ant. E._ Do you hear, you minion? you'll let us in, I hope?
_Luce._ [_Within_] I thought to have ask'd you.
_Dro. S._     [_Within_] And you said no.                           55
_Dro. E._ So, come, help:--well struck! there was blow for blow.
_Ant. E._ Thou baggage, let me in.
_Luce._            [_Within_] Can you tell for whose sake?
_Dro. E._ Master, knock the door hard.
_Luce._            [_Within_] Let him knock till it ache.
_Ant. E._ You'll cry for this, minion, if I beat the door down.
_Luce._ [_Within_] What needs all that, and a pair of stocks
        in the town?                                                60
_Adr._ [_Within_] Who is that at the door that keeps
        all this noise?
_Dro. S._ [_Within_] By my troth, your town is troubled
        with unruly boys.
_Ant. E._ Are you, there, wife? you might have come before.
_Adr._ [_Within_] Your wife, sir knave! go get you from the door.
_Dro. E._ If you went in pain, master, this 'knave'
        would go sore.                                              65
_Aug._ Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome: we would
        fain have either.
_Bal._ In debating which was best, we shall part with neither.
_Dro. E._ They stand at the door, master; bid them welcome
        hither.
_Ant. E._ There is something in the wind, that we cannot get in.
_Dro. E._ You would say so, master, if your garments were thin.     70
Your cake here is warm within; you stand here in the cold:
It would make a man mad as a buck, to be so bought and sold.
_Ant. E._ Go fetch me something: I'll break ope the gate.
_Dro. S._ [_Within_] Break any breaking here, and I'll break
        your knave's pate.
_Dro. E._ A man may break a word with you, sir; and words
        are but wind;                                               75
Ay, and break it in your face, so he break it not behind.
_Dro. S._ [_Within_] It seems thou want'st breaking: out
        upon thee, hind!
_Dro. E._ Here's too much 'out upon thee!' I pray thee,
        let me in.
_Dro. S._ [_Within_] Ay, when fowls have no feathers, and
        fish have no fin.
_Ant. E._ Well, I'll break in:--go borrow me a crow.                80
_Dro. E._ A crow without feather? Master, mean you so?
For a fish without a fin, there's a fowl without a feather:
If a crow help us in, sirrah, we'll pluck a crow together.
_Ant. E._ Go get thee gone; fetch me an iron crow.
_Bal._ Have patience, sir; O, let it not be so!                     85
Herein you war against your reputation,
And draw within the compass of suspect
Th' unviolated honour of your wife.
Once this,--your long experience of her wisdom,
Her sober virtue, years, and modesty,                               90
Plead on her part some cause to you unknown;
And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse
Why at this time the doors are made against you.
Be ruled by me: depart in patience,
And let us to the Tiger all to dinner;                              95
And about evening come yourself alone
To know the reason of this strange restraint.
If by strong hand you offer to break in
Now in the stirring passage of the day,
A vulgar comment will be made of it,                               100
And that supposed by the common rout
Against your yet ungalled estimation,
That may with foul intrusion enter in,
And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;
For slander lives upon succession,                                 105
For ever housed where it gets possession.
