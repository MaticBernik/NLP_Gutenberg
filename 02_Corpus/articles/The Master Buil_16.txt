SOLNESS.
Promised you? Threatened, I suppose you mean?
HILDA.
I don't think there was any sort of threat in that.
SOLNESS.
Well then, a little bit of fun.
HILDA.
Was that all you wanted? To make fun of me?
SOLNESS.
Well, or to have a little joke with you. Upon my soul, I don't
recollect. But it must have been something of that kind; for you were a
mere child then.
HILDA.
Oh, perhaps I wasn't quite such a child either. Not such a mere chit as
you imagine.
SOLNESS.
[Looks searchingly at her.] Did you really and seriously expect me to
come again?
HILDA.
[Conceals a half-teasing smile.] Yes, indeed! I did expect that of you.
SOLNESS.
That I should come back to your home, and take you away with me?
HILDA.
Just like a troll--yes.
SOLNESS.
And make a princess of you?
HILDA.
That's what you promised.
SOLNESS.
And give you a kingdom as well?
HILDA.
[Looks up at the ceiling.] Why not? Of course it need not have been an
actual, every-day sort of a kingdom.
SOLNESS.
But something else just as good?
HILDA.
Yes, at least as good. [Looks at him a moment.] I thought, if you could
build the highest church-towers in the world, you could surely manage to
raise a kingdom of one sort or another as well.
SOLNESS.
[Shakes his head.] I can't quite make you out, Miss Wangel.
HILDA.
Can you not? To me it seems all so simple.
SOLNESS.
No, I can't make up my mind whether you mean all you say, or are simply
having a joke with me.
HILDA.
[Smiles.] Making fun of you, perhaps? I, too?
SOLNESS.
Yes, exactly. Making fun--of both of us. [Looks at her.] Is it long
since you found out that I was married?
HILDA.
I have know it all along. Why do you ask me that?
SOLNESS.
[Lightly.] Oh, well, it just occurred to me. [Looks earnestly at her,
and says in a low voice.] What have you come for?
HILDA.
I want my kingdom. The time is up.
SOLNESS.
[Laughs involuntarily.] What a girl you are!
HILDA.
[Gaily.] Out with my kingdom, Mr. Solness! [Raps with her fingers.] The
kingdom on the table!
SOLNESS.
[Pushing the rocking-chair nearer and sitting down.] Now, seriously
speaking--what have you come for? What do you really want to do here?
HILDA.
Oh, first of all, I want to go round and look at all the things that you
have built.
SOLNESS.
That will give you plenty of exercise.
HILDA.
Yes, I know you have built a tremendous lot.
SOLNESS.
I have indeed--especially of late years.
HILDA.
Many church-towers among the rest? Immensely high ones?
SOLNESS.
No. I build no more church-towers now. Nor churches either.
HILDA.
What do you build then?
SOLNESS.
Homes for human beings.
HILDA.
[Reflectively.] Couldn't you build a little--a little bit of a
church-tower over these homes as well?
SOLNESS.
[Starting.] What do you mean by that?
HILDA.
I mean--something that points--points up into the free air. With the
vane at a dizzy height.
