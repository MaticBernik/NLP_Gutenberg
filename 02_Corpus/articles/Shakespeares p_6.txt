_Por_. You must take your chance;
And either not attempt to choose at all,
Or swear, before you choose,--if you choose wrong,
Never to speak to lady afterward
In way of marriage; therefore be advis'd.[41]
_Mor_. Nor will not; come, bring me unto my chance.
How shall I know if I do choose the right?
_Por_. The one of them contains my picture, prince;
If you choose that, then I am yours withal.
_Mor_. Some god direct my judgment! Let me see.
The first, of gold, who this inscription bears:
    "Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire."
The second, silver, which this promise carries:
    "Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves."
The third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt:[42]
    "Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath."
One of these three contains her heavenly picture.
Is't like that lead contains her? 'Twere perdition
To think so base a thought;
Or shall I think in silver she's immur'd,
Being ten times undervalued to tried gold?
O sinful thought. Never so rich a gem
Was set in worse than gold.
Deliver me the key;
Here do I choose, and thrive I as I may!
_Por_. There, take it prince, and if my form lie there,
Then I am yours.
[_He unlocks the golden casket_.
_Mor_. What have we here?
A carrion death, within whose empty eye
There is a written scroll. I'll read the writing.
    "All that glitters is not gold,
    Often have you heard that told:
    "Had you been as wise as bold,
    Young in limbs, in judgment old,
    Your answer had not been inscrol'd:
    Fare you well; your suit is cold."
Cold, indeed; and labour lost:
Then, farewell, heat; and welcome frost--Portia,
adieu! I have too griev'd a heart
To take a tedious leave: thus losers part.
[_Exit_.
_Por_. A gentle riddance:--go:--
Let all of his complexion choose me so.

HISTORICAL NOTES TO ACT FIRST.
(A) The foundation of Venice is attributed to the inhabitants of the
surrounding districts, who fled from the cruelty of Attila, King of the
Huns, and took refuge among the islets at the mouth of the Brenta. Here,
about the middle of the fifth century, they founded two small towns,
called Rivoalto and Malmocco, and, being in a manner shut out from all
other modes of employment, naturally devoted themselves to commerce. In
this way they soon became prosperous, and their numbers increased so
rapidly, that in the year 697 they made application to the Emperor to be
elected into a body politic, and obtained authority to elect a chief, to
whom they gave the name of Duke or Doge. The town, continuing to
increase, gradually extended its buildings to the adjacent islands, and,
at the same time, acquired considerable tracts of territory on the
mainland, then inhabited by the Veneti, from whence the rising city is
supposed to have borrowed its name of Venetia or Venice.
