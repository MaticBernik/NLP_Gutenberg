and I think he ought to have _finished_ them by this time. So Im
going back to him. Will you come too? Its only just round at the other
side of this tree.
It was but a few steps for _me_; but it was a great many for Sylvie; and
I had to be very careful to walk slowly, in order not to leave the
little creature so far behind as to lose sight of her.
To find Brunos _lessons_ was easy enough: they appeared to be neatly
written out on large smooth ivy-leaves, which were scattered in some
confusion over a little patch of ground where the grass had been worn
away; but the pale student, who ought by rights to have been bending
over them, was nowhere to be seen: we looked in all directions, for some
time, in vain; but at last Sylvies sharp eyes detected him, swinging on
a tendril of ivy, and Sylvies stern voice commanded his instant return
to _terra firma_ and to the business of Life.

Pleasure first and business afterwards seemed to be the motto of these
tiny folk, so many hugs and kisses had to be interchanged before
anything else could be done.
Now, Bruno, Sylvie said reproachfully, didnt I tell you you were to
go on with your lessons, unless you heard to the contrary?
But I _did_ heard to the contrary! Bruno insisted, with a mischievous
twinkle in his eye.
_What_ did you hear, you wicked boy?
It were a sort of noise in the air, said Bruno: a sort of a
scrambling noise. Didnt _oo_ hear it, Mister Sir?
Well, anyhow, you neednt go to _sleep_ over them, you lazy-lazy! For
Bruno had curled himself up, on the largest lesson, and was arranging
another as a pillow.
I _wasnt_ asleep! said Bruno, in a deeply-injured tone. When I shuts
mine eyes, its to show that Im _awake_!
Well, how much have you learned, then?
Ive learned a little tiny bit, said Bruno, modestly, being evidently
afraid of overstating his achievement. _Cant_ learn no more!
Oh Bruno! You know you _can_, if you like.
Course I can, if I _like_, the pale student replied; but I cant if
I _dont_ like!
Sylvie had a waywhich I could not too highly admireof evading Brunos
logical perplexities by suddenly striking into a new line of thought;
and this masterly stratagem she now adopted.
Well, I must say _one_ thing
Did oo know, Mister Sir, Bruno thoughtfully remarked, that Sylvie
cant count? Whenever she says I must say _one_ thing, I _know_ quite
well shell say _two_ things! And she always doos.
Two heads are better than one, Bruno, I said, but with no very
distinct idea as to what I meant by it.
I shouldnt mind having two _heads_, Bruno said softly to himself:
one head to eat mine dinner, and one head to argue wiz Sylviedoos oo
think ood look prettier if ood got _two_ heads, Mister Sir?
