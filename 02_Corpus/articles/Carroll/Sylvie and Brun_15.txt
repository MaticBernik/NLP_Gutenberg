Im glad youve said that! said Arthur. I would not like to quit the
subject without exposing the _two_ fallacies of that statementwhich
have gone so long uncontradicted that Society now accepts it as an
axiom!
What are they? I said. I dont even see _one_, myself.
One is merely the fallacy of _ambiguity_the assumption that _doing
good_ (that is, benefiting somebody) is necessarily _a good thing to
do_ (that is, a _right_ thing). The other is the assumption that, if one
of two specified acts is _better_ than another, it is necessarily a
_good_ act in itself. I should like to call this the fallacy of
_comparison_meaning that it assumes that what is _comparatively_ good
is therefore _positively_ good.
Then what is _your_ test of a good act?
That it shall be _our best_, Arthur confidently replied. And even
_then_ _we are unprofitable servants_. But let me illustrate the two
fallacies. Nothing illustrates a fallacy so well as an extreme case,
which fairly comes under it. Suppose I find two children drowning in a
pond. I rush in, and save one of the children, and then walk away,
leaving the other to drown. Clearly I have _done good_, in saving a
childs life? But. Again, supposing I meet an inoffensive stranger,
and knock him down, and walk on. Clearly that is _better_ than if I
had proceeded to jump upon him and break his ribs? But
Those buts are quite unanswerable, I said. But I should like an
instance from _real_ life.
Well, let us take one of those abominations of modern Society, a
Charity-Bazaar. Its an interesting question to think outhow much of
the money, that reaches the object in view, is _genuine_ charity; and
whether even _that_ is spent in the _best_ way. But the subject needs
regular classification, and analysis, to understand it properly.
I should be glad to _have_ it analysed, I said: it has often puzzled
me.
Well, if I am really not boring you. Let us suppose our Charity-Bazaar
to have been organised to aid the funds of some Hospital: and that A, B,
C _give_ their services in making articles to sell, and in acting as
salesmen, while X, Y, Z buy the articles, and the money so paid goes to
the Hospital.
There are two distinct species of such Bazaars: one, where the payment
exacted is merely the _market-value_ of the goods supplied, that is,
exactly what you would have to pay at a shop: the other, where
_fancy-prices_ are asked. We must take these separately.
First, the market-value case. Here A, B, C are exactly in the same
position as ordinary shopkeepers; the only difference being that they
give the proceeds to the Hospital. Practically, they are _giving their
skilled labour_ for the benefit of the Hospital. This seems to me to be
genuine charity. And I dont see how they could use it better. But X, Y,
Z, are exactly in the same position as any ordinary purchasers of goods.
To talk of charity in connection with _their_ share of the business,
is sheer nonsense. Yet they are very likely to do so.
