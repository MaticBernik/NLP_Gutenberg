_Trin._ Thou liest, most ignorant monster: I am in case
to justle a constable. Why, thou debauched fish, thou, was          25
there ever man a coward that hath drunk so much sack as
I to-day? Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie, being but half a
fish and half a monster?
_Cal._ Lo, how he mocks me! wilt thou let him, my lord?
_Trin._ 'Lord,' quoth he! That a monster should be                  30
such a natural!
_Cal._ Lo, lo, again! bite him to death, I prithee.
_Ste._ Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head: if you
prove a mutineer,--the next tree! The poor monster's my
subject, and he shall not suffer indignity.                         35
_Cal._ I thank my noble lord. Wilt thou be pleased to
hearken once again to the suit I made to thee?
_Ste._ Marry, will I: kneel and repeat it; I will stand,
and so shall Trinculo.
  _Enter ARIEL, invisible._
_Cal._ As I told thee before, I am subject to a tyrant, a           40
sorcerer, that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island.
_Ari._ Thou liest.
_Cal._           Thou liest, thou jesting monkey, thou:
I would my valiant master would destroy thee!
I do not lie.
_Ste._ Trinculo, if you trouble him any more in's tale, by          45
this hand, I will supplant some of your teeth.
_Trin._ Why, I said nothing.
_Ste._ Mum, then, and no more. Proceed.
_Cal._ I say, by sorcery he got this isle;
From me he got it. If thy greatness will                            50
Revenge it on him,--for I know thou darest,
But this thing dare not,--
_Ste._ That's most certain.
_Cal._ Thou shalt be lord of it, and I'll serve thee.
_Ste._ How now shall this be compassed? Canst thou                  55
bring me to the party?
_Cal._ Yea, yea, my lord: I'll yield him thee asleep,
Where thou mayst knock a nail into his head.
_Ari._ Thou liest; thou canst not.
_Cal._ What a pied ninny's this! Thou scurvy patch!                 60
I do beseech thy Greatness, give him blows,
And take his bottle from him: when that's gone,
He shall drink nought but brine; for I'll not show him
Where the quick freshes are.
_Ste._ Trinculo, run into no further danger: interrupt the          65
monster one word further, and, by this hand, I'll turn my
mercy out o' doors, and make a stock-fish of thee.
_Trin._ Why, what did I? I did nothing. I'll go farther
off.
_Ste._ Didst thou not say he lied?                                  70
_Ari._ Thou liest.
_Ste._ Do I so? take thou that. [_Beats him._] As you
like this, give me the lie another time.
_Trin._ I did not give the lie. Out o' your wits, and
hearing too? A pox o' your bottle! this can sack and                75
drinking do. A murrain on your monster, and the devil
take your fingers!
_Cal._ Ha, ha, ha!
_Ste._ Now, forward with your tale. --Prithee, stand farther
off.                                                                80
_Cal._ Beat him enough: after a little time,
I'll beat him too.
_Ste._ Stand farther. Come, proceed.
