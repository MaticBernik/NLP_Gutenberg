    [_The English charge upon the breach, headed by the KING.
    Alarums. The GOVERNOR of the Town appears on the walls
    with a flag of truce._
  _K. Hen._ How yet resolves the governour of the town?
  This is the latest parle we will admit:
  Therefore, to our best mercy give yourselves;
  Or, like to men proud of destruction,
  Defy us to our worst: for, as I am a soldier
  (A name that, in my thoughts, becomes me best,)
  If I begin the battery once again,
  I will not leave the half-achieved Harfleur
  Till in her ashes she lie buried.
  The gates of mercy shall be all shut up.
  What say you? will you yield, and this avoid?
  Or, guilty in defence, be thus destroy'd?
  _Gov._ Our expectation hath this day an end:
  The Dauphin, whom of succour we entreated,[9]
  Returns us--that his powers are not yet ready
  To raise so great a siege. Therefore, dread king,
  We yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy.
  Enter our town; dispose of us and ours;
  For we no longer are defensible.
    [_Soldiers shout._
    [_The GOVERNOR and others come from the town, and kneeling,
    present to KING HENRY the keys of the city._
  _K. Hen._ Come, uncle Exeter, R.
  Go you and enter Harfleur; there remain,
  And fortify it strongly 'gainst the French:
  Use mercy to them all. For us, dear uncle,--
  The winter coming on, and sickness growing
  Upon our soldiers,--we'll retire to Calais.
  To-night in Harfleur[*] will we be your guest;
  To-morrow for the march are we addrest.[10]

    [Footnote *: Extracts from the Account of the Siege of Harfleur,
    selected from the pages of the anonymous Chronicler who was an
    eyewitness of the event.
    "Our King, who sought peace, not war, in order that he might
    further arm the cause in which he was engaged with the shield of
    justice offered peace to the besieged, if they would open the
    gates to him, and restore, as was their duty, freely, without
    compulsion, that town, the noble hereditary portion of his Crown
    of England, and of his Dukedom of Normandy.
    "But as they, despising and setting at nought this offer, strove
    to keep possession of, and to defend the town against him, our
    King summoned to fight, as it were, against his will, called upon
    God to witness his just cause * * * he (King Henry) gave himself
    no rest by day or night, until having fitted and fixed his engines
    and guns under the walls, he had planted them within shot of the
    enemy, against the front of the town, and against the walls,
    gates, and towers, of the same * * * so that taking aim at the
    place to be battered, the guns from beneath blew forth stones by
    the force of ignited powers, * * * and in the mean time our King,
    with his guns and engines, so battered the said bulwark, and the
    walls and towers on every side, that within a few days, by the
    impetuosity and fury of the stones, the same bulwark was in a
    great part broken down; and the walls and towers from which the
    enemy had sent forth their weapons, the bastions falling in ruins,
    were rendered defenceless; and very fine edifices, even in the
    middle of the city, either lay altogether in ruins, or threatened
    an inevitable fall; or at least were so shaken as to be
    exceedingly damaged. * * * And although our guns had disarmed the
    bulwark, walls, and towers during the day, the besieged by night,
    with logs, faggots, and tubs on vessels full of earth, mud, and
    sand or stones, piled up within the shattered walls, and with
    other barricadoes, refortified the streets. * * * The King had
    caused towers and wooden bulwarks to the height of the walls, and
    ladders and other instruments, besides those which he had brought
    with him for the assault." --We are then told that the enemy
    contrived to set these engines on fire 'by means of powders, and
    combustibles prepared on the walls.'
