{Knox}
(_Looking intently at Starkweather._) I should have recognized him
from his photographs. But why do you say such things?
{Margaret}
Because they are true.
(_He remains silent._) Now, aren't they? (_She laughs._) Oh, you
don't need to answer. You know the truth, the whole bitter truth.
This _is_ a den of thieves. There is Mr. Hubbard over there, for
instance, the trusty journalist lieutenant of the corporations.
{Knox}
(_With an expression of disgust._) I know him. It was he that wrote
the Standard Oil side of the story, after having abused Standard
Oil for years in the pseudo-muck-raking magazines. He made them
come up to his price, that was all. He's the star writer on
_Cartwright's_, now, since that magazine changed its policy
and became subsidizedly reactionary. I know him--a thoroughly
dishonest man. Truly am I Ali Baba, and truly I wonder why I am
here.
{Margaret}
You are here, sir, because I like you to come.
{Knox}
We do have much in common, you and I.
{Margaret}
The future.
{Knox}
(_Gravely, looking at her with shining eyes._) I sometimes fear for
more immediate reasons than that.
(_Margaret looks at him in alarm, and at the same time betrays
pleasure in what he has said._) For you.
{Margaret}
(_Hastily._) Don't look at me that way. Your eyes are flashing.
Some one might see and misunderstand.
{Knox}
(_In confusion, awkwardly._) I was unaware that I--that I was
looking at you----in any way that----
{Margaret}
I'll tell you why you are here. Because I sent for you.
{Knox}
(_With signs of ardor._) I would come whenever you sent for me, and
go wherever you might send me.
{Margaret}
(_Reprovingly._)
Please, please---- It was about that speech. I have been hearing
about it from everybody--rumblings and mutterings and dire
prophecies. I know how busy you are, and I ought not to have
asked you to come. But there was no other way, and I was so
anxious.
{Knox}
(_Pleased._) It seems so strange that you, being what you are,
affiliated as you are, should be interested in the welfare of the
common people.
{Margaret}
(_Judicially._) I do seem like a traitor in my own camp. But as
father said a while ago, I, too, have dreamed my dream. I did it
as a girl--Plato's _Republic_, Moore's _Utopia_--I was steeped in
all the dreams of the social dreamers.
(_During all that follows of her speech, Knox is keenly
interested, his eyes glisten and he hangs on her words._)
And I dreamed that I, too, might do something to bring on the
era of universal justice and fair play. In my heart I dedicated
myself to the cause of humanity. I made Lincoln my hero-he
still is. But I was only a girl, and where was I to find
this cause?--how to work for it? I was shut in by a thousand
restrictions, hedged in by a thousand conventions. Everybody
laughed at me when I expressed the thoughts that burned in me.
What could I do? I was only a woman. I had neither vote nor right
of utterance. I must remain silent. I must do nothing. Men, in
their lordly wisdom, did all. They voted, orated, governed. The
place for women was in the home, taking care of some lordly man
who did all these lordly things.
