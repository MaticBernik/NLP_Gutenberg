MISS JAY [looking round].
Where is he hid?
FALK.
                 His present hiding-place
Is in the garden loft, our common lair;
                                    [Blandly.
But let me beg you not to seek him there;
Give him a breathing time!
MISS JAY.
                           Well, good: the grace
Will not be long, tho'.
FALK.
                        Nay, be generous!
Ten minutes,--then begin the game again.
He has an English sermon on the brain.
MISS JAY.
An English--?
LADIES.
              O you laugh!  You're fooling us!
FALK.
I'm in grim earnest.  'Tis his fixed intention
To take a charge among the emigrants,
And therefore--
MISS JAY [with horror].
                Heavens, he had the face to mention
That mad idea?                      [To the ladies.
                      O quick--fetch all the aunts!
Anna, her mother, Mrs. Strawman too.
LADIES [agitated].
This must be stopped!
ALL.
                      We'll make a great ado!
MISS JAY.
Thank God, they're coming.
    [To ANNA, who comes from the garden-room with STRAWMAN,
      his wife and children, STIVER, GULDSTAD, MRS. HALM and
      the other guests.
MISS JAY.
                           Do you know what Lind
Has secretly determined in his mind?
To go as missionary--
ANNA.
                      Yes, I know.
MRS. HALM.
And you've agreed--!
ANNA [embarrassed].
                     That I will also go.
MISS JAY [indignant].
He's talked this stuff to you!
LADIES [clasping their hands together].
                               What tyranny!
FALK.
But think, his Call that would not be denied--!
MISS JAY.
Tut, that's what people follow when they're free:
A bridegroom follows nothing but his bride.--
No, my sweet Anna, ponder, I entreat:
You, reared in comfort from your earliest breath--?
FALK.
Yet, sure, to suffer for the faith is sweet!
MISS JAY.
Is one to suffer for one's bridegroom's faith?
That is a rather novel point of view.
                                    [To the ladies.
Ladies, attend!
                                 [Takes ANNA's arm.
                   Now listen; then repeat
For his instruction what he has to do.
    [They go into the background and out to the right
      in eager talk with several of the ladies; the
      other guests disperse in Groups about the garden.
      FALK stops STRAWMAN, whose wife and children keep
      close to him.  GULDSTAD goes to and fro during
      the following conversation.
FALK.
Come, pastor, help young fervour in its fight,
Before they lure Miss Anna from her vows.
STRAWMAN [in clerical cadence].
The wife must be submissive to the spouse;--
                                      [Reflecting.
But if I apprehended him aright,
His Call's a problematical affair,
The offering altogether in the air--
FALK.
Pray do not judge so rashly.  I can give
You absolute assurance, as I live,
His Call is definite and incontestable--
STRAWMAN [seeing it in a new light].
Ah--if there's something fixed--investable--
Per annum--then I've nothing more to say.
FALK [impatiently].
You think the most of what I count the least;
I mean the inspiration,--to the pay!
STRAWMAN [with an unctuous smile].
Pay is the first condition of a priest
In Asia, Africa, America,
Or where you will.  Ah yes, if he were free,
My dear young friend, I willingly agree,
The thing might pass; but, being pledged and bound,
He'll scarcely find the venture very sound.
Reflect, he's young and vigorous, sure to found
A little family in time; assume his will
To be the very best on earth--but still
The means, my friend--?  'Build not upon the sand,'
Says Scripture.  If, upon the other hand,
The Offering--
