Matter! replied the girl. Nothing. What do you look at me so hard
for?
What foolery is this? demanded Sikes, grasping her by the arm, and
shaking her roughly. What is it? What do you mean? What are you
thinking of, ha?
Of many things, Bill, replied the girl, shuddering, and as she did
so, pressing her hands upon her eyes. But, Lord! what odds in that?
The tone of forced gaiety in which the last words were spoken seemed to
produce a deeper impression on Sikes than the wild and rigid look which
had preceded them.
I tell you wot it is, said Sikes, if you havent caught the fever,
and got it comin on now, theres something more than usual in the
wind, and something dangerous, too. Youre not a-going to No,
damme! you wouldnt do that!
Do what? asked the girl.
There aint, said Sikes, fixing his eyes upon her, and muttering the
words to himself, there aint a stauncher-hearted gal going, or Id
have cut her throat three months ago. Shes got the fever coming on;
thats it.
Fortifying himself with this assurance, Sikes drained the glass to the
bottom, and then, with many grumbling oaths, called for his physic. The
girl jumped up with great alacrity, poured it quickly out, but with her
back towards him: and held the vessel to his lips, while he drank it
off.
Now, said the robber, come and sit aside of me, and put on your own
face, or Ill alter it so that you wont know it again when you _do_
want it.
The girl obeyed, and Sikes, locking her hand in his, fell back upon
the pillow, turning his eyes upon her face. They closed, opened again;
closed once more, again opened; the housebreaker shifted his position
restlessly, and, after dozing again and again for two or three minutes,
and as often springing up with a look of terror, and gazing vacantly
about him, was suddenly stricken, as it were, while in the very
attitude of rising, into a deep and heavy sleep. The grasp of his hand
relaxed, the upraised arm fell languidly by his side, and he lay like
one in a profound trance.
The laudanum has taken effect at last, murmured the girl as she rose
from the bedside. I may be too late even now.
She hastily dressed herself in her bonnet and shawl, looking fearfully
round from time to time as if, despite the sleeping draught, she
expected every moment to feel the pressure of Sikess heavy hand
upon her shoulder; then stooping softly over the bed, she kissed the
robbers lips, and opening and closing the room-door with noiseless
touch, hurried from the house.
A watchman was crying half-past nine down a dark passage through which
she had to pass in gaining the main thoroughfare.
Has it long gone the half-hour? asked the girl.
Itll strike the hour in another quarter, said the man, raising his
lantern to her face.
And I cannot get there in less than an hour or more, muttered Nancy,
brushing swiftly past him and gliding rapidly down the street.
