[Footnote 1: Woodcocks were understood to have no brains.]
[Footnote 2: _1st Q_. 'How prodigall the tongue lends the heart vowes.'
I was inclined to take _Prodigall_ for a noun, a proper name or epithet
given to the soul, as in a moral play: _Prodigall, the soul_; but I
conclude it only an adjective used as an adverb, and the capital P a
blunder.]
[Footnote 3: --in both light and heat.]
[Footnote 4: The _Quarto_ has not 'Daughter.']
[Footnote 5: _To be entreated_ is _to yield_: 'he would nowise be
entreated:' _entreatments, yieldings_: 'you are not to see him just
because he chooses to command a parley.']
[Footnote 6: 'In few words'; in brief.]
[Footnote 7: I suspect a misprint in the Folio here--that an _e_ has got
in for a _d_, and that the change from the _Quarto_ should be _Not of
the dye_. Then the line would mean, using the antecedent word _brokers_
in the bad sense, 'Not themselves of the same colour as their garments
(_investments_); his vows are clothed in innocence, but are not
innocent; they are mere panders.' The passage is rendered yet more
obscure to the modern sense by the accidental propinquity of _bonds,
brokers_, and _investments_--which have nothing to do with _stocks_.]
[Footnote 8: 'This means in sum:'.]
[Footnote 9: 'so slander any moment with the name of leisure as to': to
call it leisure, if leisure stood for talk with Hamlet, would be to
slander the time. We might say, 'so slander any man friend as to expect
him to do this or that unworthy thing for you.']
[Footnote 10: _1st Q_.
    _Ofelia_, receiue none of his letters,
    For louers lines are snares to intrap the heart;
    [Sidenote: 82] Refuse his tokens, both of them are keyes
    To vnlocke Chastitie vnto Desire;
    Come in _Ofelia_; such men often proue,
    Great in their wordes, but little in their loue.
'_men often prove such_--great &c.'--Compare _Twelfth Night_, act ii.
sc. 4, lines 120, 121, _Globe ed.]
[Footnote 11: Fresh trouble for Hamlet_.]
[Footnote 12: _1st Q._
    The ayre bites shrewd; it is an eager and
    An nipping winde, what houre i'st?]
[Footnote 13: Again the cold.]
[Footnote 14: The stage-direction of the _Q_. is necessary here.]

[Sidenote: 22, 25] _Ham_. The King doth wake to night, and takes his
rouse,
Keepes wassels and the swaggering vpspring reeles,[1]
                                         [Sidenote: wassell | up-spring]
And as he dreines his draughts of Renish downe,
The kettle Drum and Trumpet thus bray out
The triumph of his Pledge.
_Horat_. Is it a custome?
_Ham_. I marry ist;
And to my mind, though I am natiue heere,             [Sidenote: But to]
And to the manner borne: It is a Custome
More honour'd in the breach, then the obseruance.

_Enter Ghost._
_Hor_. Looke my Lord, it comes.
[Sidenote: 172] _Ham_. Angels and Ministers of Grace defend vs:

Bring with thee ayres from Heauen, or blasts from Hell,[2]
