LORD WINDERMERE.  I am not called on to encourage Lord Augustus, I
suppose?
MRS. ERLYNNE.  Oh, no!  I do the encouraging.  But you will make me a
handsome settlement, Windermere, wont you?
LORD WINDERMERE.  [_Frowning_.]  Is that what you want to talk to me
about to-night?
MRS. ERLYNNE.  Yes.
LORD WINDERMERE.  [_With a gesture of impatience_.]  I will not talk of
it here.
MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_Laughing_.]  Then we will talk of it on the terrace.
Even business should have a picturesque background.  Should it not,
Windermere?  With a proper background women can do anything.
LORD WINDERMERE.  Wont to-morrow do as well?
MRS. ERLYNNE.  No; you see, to-morrow I am going to accept him.  And I
think it would be a good thing if I was able to tell him that I hadwell,
what shall I say?L2000 a year left to me by a third cousinor a second
husbandor some distant relative of that kind.  It would be an additional
attraction, wouldnt it?  You have a delightful opportunity now of paying
me a compliment, Windermere.  But you are not very clever at paying
compliments.  I am afraid Margaret doesnt encourage you in that
excellent habit.  Its a great mistake on her part.  When men give up
saying what is charming, they give up thinking what is charming.  But
seriously, what do you say to L2000?  L2500, I think.  In modern life
margin is everything.  Windermere, dont you think the world an intensely
amusing place?  I do!
[_Exit on terrace with_ LORD WINDERMERE.  Music strikes up in ball-room.]
LADY WINDERMERE.  To stay in this house any longer is impossible.
To-night a man who loves me offered me his whole life.  I refused it.  It
was foolish of me.  I will offer him mine now.  I will give him mine.  I
will go to him!  [_Puts on cloak and goes to the door_, _then turns
back_.  _Sits down at table and writes a letter_, _puts it into an
envelope_, _and leaves it on table_.]  Arthur has never understood me.
When he reads this, he will.  He may do as he chooses now with his life.
I have done with mine as I think best, as I think right.  It is he who
has broken the bond of marriagenot I.  I only break its bondage.
                                                                 [_Exit_.]
[_PARKER enters L. and crosses towards the ball-room R._  _Enter_ MRS.
ERLYNNE.]
MRS. ERLYNNE.  Is Lady Windermere in the ball-room?
PARKER.  Her ladyship has just gone out.
MRS. ERLYNNE.  Gone out?  Shes not on the terrace?
PARKER.  No, madam.  Her ladyship has just gone out of the house.
MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_Starts_, _and looks at the servant with a puzzled
expression in her face_.]  Out of the house?
PARKER.  Yes, madamher ladyship told me she had left a letter for his
lordship on the table.
MRS. ERLYNNE.  A letter for Lord Windermere?
PARKER.  Yes, madam.
MRS. ERLYNNE.  Thank you.
[_Exit_ PARKER.  _The music in the ball-room stops_.]  Gone out of her
house!  A letter addressed to her husband!  [_Goes over to bureau and
looks at letter_.  _Takes it up and lays it down again with a shudder of
fear_.]  No, no!  It would be impossible!  Life doesnt repeat its
tragedies like that!  Oh, why does this horrible fancy come across me?
Why do I remember now the one moment of my life I most wish to forget?
Does life repeat its tragedies?  [_Tears letter open and reads it_, _then
sinks down into a chair with a gesture of anguish_.]  Oh, how terrible!
The same words that twenty years ago I wrote to her father! and how
bitterly I have been punished for it!  No; my punishment, my real
punishment is to-night, is now!  [_Still seated R._]
