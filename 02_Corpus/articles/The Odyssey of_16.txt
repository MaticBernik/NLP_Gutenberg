BOOK XVII
ARGUMENT
Telemachus returns to the city, and relates to his mother the principal
passages of his voyage; Ulysses, conducted by Eumaeus, arrives there also,
and enters among the suitors, having been known only by his old dog
Argus, who dies at his feet. The curiosity of Penelope being excited by
the account which Eumaeus gives her of Ulysses, she orders him immediately
into her presence, but Ulysses postpones the interview till evening, when
the suitors having left the palace, there shall be no danger of
interruption. Eumaeus returns to his cottage.
    Now look'd Aurora from the East abroad,
    When the illustrious offspring of divine
    Ulysses bound his sandals to his feet;
    He seiz'd his sturdy spear match'd to his gripe,
    And to the city meditating quick
    Departure now, the swine-herd thus bespake.
      Father! I seek the city, to convince
    My mother of my safe return, whose tears,
    I judge, and lamentation shall not cease
    Till her own eyes behold me. But I lay                            10
    On thee this charge. Into the city lead,
    Thyself, this hapless guest, that he may beg
    Provision there, a morsel and a drop
    From such as may, perchance, vouchsafe the boon.
    I cannot, vext and harass'd as I am,
    Feed all, and should the stranger take offence,
    The worse for him. Plain truth is my delight.
      To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied.
    Nor is it my desire to be detained.
    Better the mendicant in cities seeks                              20
    His dole, vouchsafe it whosoever may,
    Than in the villages. I am not young,
    Nor longer of an age that well accords
    With rural tasks, nor could I all perform
    That it might please a master to command.
    Go then, and when I shall have warm'd my limbs
    Before the hearth, and when the risen sun
    Shall somewhat chase the cold, thy servant's task
    Shall be to guide me thither, as thou bidd'st,
    For this is a vile garb; the frosty air                           30
    Of morning would benumb me thus attired,
    And, as ye say, the city is remote.
      He ended, and Telemachus in haste
    Set forth, his thoughts all teeming as he went
    With dire revenge. Soon in the palace-courts
    Arriving, he reclined his spear against
    A column, and proceeded to the hall.
    Him Euryclea, first, his nurse, perceived,
    While on the variegated seats she spread
    Their fleecy cov'ring; swift with tearful eyes                    40
    She flew to him, and the whole female train
    Of brave Ulysses swarm'd around his son,
    Clasping him, and his forehead and his neck
    Kissing affectionate; then came, herself,
    As golden Venus or Diana fair,
    Forth from her chamber to her son's embrace,
    The chaste Penelope; with tears she threw
    Her arms around him, his bright-beaming eyes
    And forehead kiss'd, and with a murmur'd plaint
    Maternal, in wing'd accents thus began.                           50
      Thou hast return'd, light of my eyes! my son!
    My lov'd Telemachus! I had no hope
    To see thee more when once thou hadst embark'd
    For Pylus, privily, and with no consent
    From me obtain'd, news seeking of thy sire.
    But haste; unfold. Declare what thou hast seen.
      To whom Telemachus, discrete, replied.
    Ah mother! let my sorrows rest, nor me
    From death so lately 'scaped afflict anew,
    But, bathed and habited in fresh attire,                          60
    With all the maidens of thy train ascend
    To thy superior chamber, there to vow
    A perfect hecatomb to all the Gods,
    When Jove shall have avenged our num'rous wrongs.
    I seek the forum, there to introduce
    A guest, my follower from the Pylian shore,
    Whom sending forward with my noble band,
    I bade Piraeus to his own abode
    Lead him, and with all kindness entertain
    The stranger, till I should myself arrive.                        70
      He spake, nor flew his words useless away.
    She, bathed and habited in fresh attire,
    Vow'd a full hecatomb to all the Gods,
    Would Jove but recompense her num'rous wrongs.
    Then, spear in hand, went forth her son, two dogs
    Fleet-footed following him. O'er all his form
    Pallas diffused a dignity divine,
    And ev'ry eye gazed on him as he pass'd.
    The suitors throng'd him round, joy on their lips
    And welcome, but deep mischief in their hearts.                   80
    He, shunning all that crowd, chose to himself
    A seat, where Mentor sat, and Antiphus,
    And Halytherses, long his father's friends
    Sincere, who of his voyage much enquired.
    Then drew Piraeus nigh, leading his guest
    Toward the forum; nor Telemachus
    Stood long aloof, but greeted his approach,
    And was accosted by Piraeus thus.
      Sir! send thy menial women to bring home
    The precious charge committed to my care,                         90
    Thy gifts at Menelaus' hands received.
      To whom Telemachus, discrete, replied.
    Piraeus! wait; for I not yet foresee
    The upshot. Should these haughty ones effect
    My death, clandestine, under my own roof,
    And parcel my inheritance by lot,
    I rather wish those treasures thine, than theirs.
    But should I with success plan for them all
    A bloody death, then, wing'd with joy, thyself
    Bring home those presents to thy joyful friend.                  100
      So saying, he led the anxious stranger thence
    Into the royal mansion, where arrived,
    Each cast his mantle on a couch or throne,
    And plung'd his feet into a polish'd bath.
    There wash'd and lubricated with smooth oils,
    From the attendant maidens each received
    Tunic and shaggy mantle. Thus attired,
    Forth from the baths they stepp'd, and sat again.
    A maiden, next, with golden ewer charged,
    And silver bowl, pour'd water on their hands,                    110
    And spread the polish'd table, which with food
    Of all kinds, remnants of the last regale,
    The mistress of the household charge supplied.
    Meantime, beside a column of the dome
    His mother, on a couch reclining, twirl'd
    Her slender threads. They to the furnish'd board
    Stretch'd forth their hands, and, hunger now and thirst
    Both satisfied, Penelope began.
      Telemachus! I will ascend again,
    And will repose me on my woeful bed;                             120
    For such it hath been, and with tears of mine
    Ceaseless bedew'd, e'er since Ulysses went
    With Atreus' sons to Troy. For not a word
    Thou would'st vouchsafe me till our haughty guests
    Had occupied the house again, of all
    That thou hast heard (if aught indeed thou hast)
    Of thy long-absent father's wish'd return.
      Her answer'd then Telemachus discrete.
    Mother, at thy request I will with truth
    Relate the whole. At Pylus shore arrived                         130
    We Nestor found, Chief of the Pylian race.
    Receiving me in his august abode,
    He entertain'd me with such welcome kind
    As a glad father shews to his own son
    Long-lost and newly found; so Nestor me,
    And his illustrious offspring, entertain'd,
    But yet assured me that he nought had heard
    From mortal lips of my magnanimous sire,
    Whether alive or dead; with his own steeds
    He sent me, and with splendid chariot thence                     140
    To spear-famed Menelaus, Atreus' son.
    There saw I Helen, by the Gods' decree
    Auth'ress of trouble both to Greece and Troy.
    The Hero Menelaus then enquired
    What cause had urged me to the pleasant vale
    Of Lacedaemon; plainly I rehearsed
    The occasion, and the Hero thus replied.
      Ye Gods! they are ambitious of the bed
    Of a brave man, however base themselves.
    But, as it chances when the hart hath laid                       150
    Her fawns new-yean'd and sucklings yet, to rest
    In some resistless lion's den, she roams,
    Meantime, the hills, and in the grassy vales
    Feeds heedless, but the lion to his lair
    Returning soon, both her and hers destroys,
    So shall thy father, brave Ulysses, them.
    Jove! Pallas! and Apollo! oh that such
    As erst in well-built Lesbos, where he strove
    With Philomelides, whom wrestling, flat
    He threw, when all Achaia's sons rejoiced,                       160
    Ulysses, now, might mingle with his foes!
    Short life and bitter nuptials should be theirs,
    But thy enquiries neither indirect
    Will I evade, nor give thee false reply,
    But all that from the Ancient of the Deep[73]
    I have received will utter, hiding nought.
    The God declared that he had seen thy sire
    In a lone island, sorrowing, and detain'd
    An inmate in the grotto of the nymph
    Calypso, wanting also means by which                             170
    To reach the country of his birth again,
    For neither gallant barks nor friends had he
    To speed his passage o'er the boundless waves.
      So Menelaus spake, the spear-renown'd.
    My errand thus accomplish'd, I return'd--
    And by the Gods with gales propitious blest,
    Was wafted swiftly to my native shore.
      He spake, and tumult in his mother's heart
    So speaking, raised. Consolatory, next,
    The godlike Theoclymenus began.                                  180
      Consort revered of Laertiades!
    Little the Spartan knew, but list to me,
    For I will plainly prophesy and sure.
    Be Jove of all in heav'n my witness first,
    Then this thy hospitable board, and, last,
    The household Gods of the illustrious Chief
    Ulysses, at whose hearth I have arrived,[74]
    That, even now, within his native isle
    Ulysses somewhere sits, or creeps obscure,
    Witness of these enormities, and seeds                           190
    Sowing of dire destruction for his foes;
    So sure an augury, while on the deck
    Reclining of the gallant bark, I saw,
    And with loud voice proclaim'd it to thy son.
      Him answer'd then Penelope discrete.
    Grant heav'n, my guest, that this good word of thine
    Fail not! then shalt thou soon such bounty share
    And friendship at my hands, that at first sight
    Whoe'er shall meet thee shall pronounce thee blest.
      Thus they conferr'd. Meantime the suitors hurl'd               200
    The quoit and lance on the smooth area spread
    Before Ulysses' gate, the custom'd scene
    Of their contentions, sports, and clamours rude.
    But when the hour of supper now approach'd,
    And from the pastures on all sides the sheep
    Came with their wonted drivers, Medon then
    (For he of all the heralds pleas'd them most,
    And waited at the board) them thus address'd.
      Enough of play, young princes! ent'ring now
    The house, prepare we sedulous our feast,                        210
    Since in well-timed refreshment harm is none.
      He spake, whose admonition pleas'd. At once
    All, rising, sought the palace; there arrived,
    Each cast his mantle off, which on his throne
    Or couch he spread, then, brisk, to slaughter fell
    Of many a victim; sheep and goats and brawns
    They slew, all fatted, and a pastur'd ox,
    Hast'ning the banquet; nor with less dispatch
    Ulysses and Eumaeus now prepared
    To seek the town, when thus the swain began.                     220
      My guest! since thy fixt purpose is to seek
    This day the city as my master bade,
    Though I, in truth, much rather wish thee here
    A keeper of our herds, yet, through respect
    And rev'rence of his orders, whose reproof
    I dread, for masters seldom gently chide,
    I would be gone. Arise, let us depart,
    For day already is far-spent, and soon
    The air of even-tide will chill thee more.
      To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied.                           230
    It is enough. I understand. Thou speak'st
    To one intelligent. Let us depart,
    And lead, thyself, the way; but give me, first,
    (If thou have one already hewn) a staff
    To lean on, for ye have described the road
    Rugged, and ofttimes dang'rous to the foot.
      So saying, his tatter'd wallet o'er his back
    He cast, suspended by a leathern twist,
    Eumaeus gratified him with a staff,
    And forth they went, leaving the cottage kept                    240
    By dogs and swains. He city-ward his King
    Led on, in form a squalid beggar old,
    Halting, and in unseemly garb attired.
    But when, slow-travelling the craggy way,
    They now approach'd the town, and had attain'd
    The marble fountain deep, which with its streams
    Pellucid all the citizens supplied,
    (Ithacus had that fountain framed of old
    With Neritus and Polyctor, over which
    A grove of water-nourish'd alders hung                           250
    Circular on all sides, while cold the rill
    Ran from the rock, on whose tall summit stood
    The altar of the nymphs, by all who pass'd
    With sacrifice frequented, still, and pray'r)
    Melantheus, son of Dolius, at that fount
    Met them; the chosen goats of ev'ry flock,
    With two assistants, from the field he drove,
    The suitors' supper. He, seeing them both,
    In surly accent boorish, such as fired
    Ulysses with resentment, thus began.                             260
      Ay--this is well--The villain leads the vile--
    Thus evermore the Gods join like to like.
    Thou clumsy swine-herd, whither would'st conduct
    This morsel-hunting mendicant obscene,
    Defiler base of banquets? many a post
    Shall he rub smooth that props him while he begs
    Lean alms, sole object of his low pursuit,
    Who ne'er to sword or tripod yet aspired.
    Would'st thou afford him to me for a guard
    Or sweeper of my stalls, or to supply                            270
    My kids with leaves, he should on bulkier thewes
    Supported stand, though nourish'd but with whey.
    But no such useful arts hath he acquired,
    Nor likes he work, but rather much to extort
    From others food for his unsated maw.
    But mark my prophecy, for it is true,
    At famed Ulysses' house should he arrive,
    His sides shall shatter many a footstool hurl'd
    Against them by the offended princes there.
      He spake, and drawing nigh, with his rais'd foot,              280
    Insolent as he was and brutish, smote
    Ulysses' haunch, yet shook not from his path
    The firm-set Chief, who, doubtful, mused awhile
    Whether to rush on him, and with his staff
    To slay him, or uplifting him on high,
    Downward to dash him headlong; but his wrath
    Restraining, calm he suffer'd the affront.
    Him then Eumaeus with indignant look
    Rebuking, rais'd his hands, and fervent pray'd.
      Nymphs of the fountains, progeny of Jove!                      290
    If e'er Ulysses on your altar burn'd
    The thighs of fatted lambs or kidlings, grant
    This my request. O let the Hero soon,
    Conducted by some Deity, return!
    So shall he quell that arrogance which safe
    Thou now indulgest, roaming day by day
    The city, while bad shepherds mar the flocks.
      To whom the goat-herd answer thus return'd
    Melantheus. Marvellous! how rare a speech
    The subtle cur hath framed! whom I will send                     300
    Far hence at a convenient time on board
    My bark, and sell him at no little gain.
    I would, that he who bears the silver bow
    As sure might pierce Telemachus this day
    In his own house, or that the suitors might,
    As that same wand'rer shall return no more!
      He said, and them left pacing slow along,
    But soon, himself, at his Lord's house arrived;
    There ent'ring bold, he with the suitors sat
    Opposite to Eurymachus, for him                                  310
    He valued most. The sewers his portion placed
    Of meat before him, and the maiden, chief
    Directress of the household gave him bread.
    And now, Ulysses, with the swain his friend
    Approach'd, when, hearing the harmonious lyre,
    Both stood, for Phemius had begun his song.
    He grasp'd the swine-herd's hand, and thus he said.
      This house, Eumaeus! of Ulysses seems
    Passing magnificent, and to be known
    With ease for his among a thousand more.                         320
    One pile supports another, and a wall
    Crested with battlements surrounds the court;
    Firm, too, the folding doors all force of man
    Defy; but num'rous guests, as I perceive,
    Now feast within; witness the sav'ry steam
    Fast-fuming upward, and the sounding harp,
    Divine associate of the festive board.
      To whom, Eumaeus, thou didst thus reply.
    Thou hast well-guess'd; no wonder, thou art quick
    On ev'ry theme; but let us well forecast                         330
    This business. Wilt thou, ent'ring first, thyself,
    The splendid mansion, with the suitors mix,
    Me leaving here? or shall I lead the way
    While thou remain'st behind? yet linger not,
    Lest, seeing thee without, some servant strike
    Or drive thee hence. Consider which were best.
      Him answer'd, then, the patient Hero bold.
    It is enough. I understand. Thou speak'st
    To one intelligent. Lead thou the way
    Me leaving here, for neither stripes nor blows                   340
    To me are strange. Much exercised with pain
    In fight and on the Deep, I have long since
    Learn'd patience. Follow, next, what follow may!
    But, to suppress the appetite, I deem
    Impossible; the stomach is a source
    Of ills to man, an avaricious gulph
    Destructive, which to satiate, ships are rigg'd,
    Seas travers'd, and fierce battles waged remote.
      Thus they discoursing stood; Argus the while,
    Ulysses' dog, uplifted where he lay                              350
    His head and ears erect. Ulysses him
    Had bred long since, himself, but rarely used,
    Departing, first, to Ilium. Him the youths
    In other days led frequent to the chace
    Of wild goat, hart and hare; but now he lodg'd
    A poor old cast-off, of his Lord forlorn,
    Where mules and oxen had before the gate
    Much ordure left, with which Ulysses' hinds
    Should, in due time, manure his spacious fields.
    There lay, with dog-devouring vermin foul                        360
    All over, Argus; soon as he perceived
    Long-lost Ulysses nigh, down fell his ears
    Clapp'd close, and with his tail glad sign he gave
    Of gratulation, impotent to rise
    And to approach his master as of old.
    Ulysses, noting him, wiped off a tear
    Unmark'd, and of Eumaeus quick enquired.
      I can but wonder seeing such a dog
    Thus lodg'd, Eumaeus! beautiful in form
    He is, past doubt, but whether he hath been                      370
    As fleet as fair I know not; rather such
    Perchance as masters sometimes keep to grace
    Their tables, nourish'd more for shew than use.
      To whom, Eumaeus, thou didst thus reply.
    He is the dog of one dead far remote.
    But had he now such feat-performing strength
    As when Ulysses left him, going hence
    To Ilium, in one moment thou shouldst mark,
    Astonish'd, his agility and force.
    He never in the sylvan deep recess                               380
    The wild beast saw that 'scaped him, and he track'd
    Their steps infallible; but he hath now
    No comfort, for (the master dead afar)
    The heedless servants care not for his dog.
    Domestics, missing once their Lord's controul,
    Grow wilful, and refuse their proper tasks;
    For whom Jove dooms to servitude, he takes
    At once the half of that man's worth away.
      He said, and, ent'ring at the portal, join'd
    The suitors. Then his destiny released                           390
    Old Argus, soon as he had lived to see
    Ulysses in the twentieth year restored.
      Godlike Telemachus, long ere the rest,
    Marking the swine-herd's entrance, with a nod
    Summon'd him to approach. Eumaeus cast
    His eye around, and seeing vacant there
    The seat which the dispenser of the feast
    Was wont to occupy while he supplied
    The num'rous guests, planted it right before
    Telemachus, and at his table sat,                                400
    On which the herald placed for him his share
    Of meat, and from the baskets gave him bread.
    Soon after _him_, Ulysses enter'd slow
    The palace, like a squalid beggar old,
    Staff-propp'd, and in loose tatters foul attired.
    Within the portal on the ashen sill
    He sat, and, seeming languid, lean'd against
    A cypress pillar by the builder's art
    Polish'd long since, and planted at the door.
    Then took Telemachus a loaf entire                               410
    Forth from the elegant basket, and of flesh
    A portion large as his two hands contained,
    And, beck'ning close the swine-herd, charged him thus.
      These to the stranger; whom advise to ask
    Some dole from ev'ry suitor; bashful fear
    Ill suits the mendicant by want oppress'd.
      He spake; Eumaeus went, and where he sat
    Arriving, in wing'd accents thus began.
      Telemachus, oh stranger, sends thee these,
    And counsels thee to importune for more                          420
    The suitors, one by one; for bashful fear
    Ill suits the mendicant by want oppress'd.
      To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied.
    Jove, King of all, grant ev'ry good on earth
    To kind Telemachus, and the complete
    Accomplishment of all that he desires!
      He said, and with both hands outspread, the mess
    Receiving as he sat, on his worn bag
    Disposed it at his feet. Long as the bard
    Chaunted, he ate, and when he ceas'd to eat,                     430
    Then also ceas'd the bard divine to sing.
    And now ensued loud clamour in the hall
    And tumult, when Minerva, drawing nigh
    To Laertiades, impell'd the Chief
    Crusts to collect, or any pittance small
    At ev'ry suitor's hand, for trial's sake
    Of just and unjust; yet deliv'rance none
    From evil she design'd for any there.
    From left to right[75] his progress he began
    Petitioning, with outstretch'd hands, the throng,                440
    As one familiar with the beggar's art.
    They, pitying, gave to him, but view'd him still
    With wonder, and enquiries mutual made
    Who, and whence was he? Then the goat-herd rose
    Melanthius, and th' assembly thus address'd.
      Hear me, ye suitors of th' illustrious Queen!
    This guest, of whom ye ask, I have beheld
    Elsewhere; the swine-herd brought him; but himself
    I know not, neither who nor whence he is.
      So he; then thus Antinoues stern rebuked                        450
    The swine-herd. Ah, notorious as thou art,
    Why hast thou shewn this vagabond the way
    Into the city? are we not enough
    Infested with these troublers of our feasts?
    Deem'st it a trifle that such numbers eat
    At thy Lord's cost, and hast thou, therefore, led
    This fellow hither, found we know not where?
      To whom, Eumaeus, thou didst thus reply.
    Antinoues! though of high degree, thou speak'st
    Not wisely. What man to another's house                          460
    Repairs to invite him to a feast, unless
    He be of those who by profession serve
    The public, prophet, healer of disease,
    Ingenious artist, or some bard divine
    Whose music may exhilarate the guests?
    These, and such only, are in ev'ry land
    Call'd to the banquet; none invites the poor,
    Who much consume, and no requital yield.
    But thou of all the suitors roughly treat'st
    Ulysses' servants most, and chiefly me;                          470
    Yet thee I heed not, while the virtuous Queen
    Dwells in this palace, and her godlike son.
      To whom Telemachus, discrete, replied.
    Peace! answer not verbose a man like him.
    Antinoues hath a tongue accustom'd much
    To tauntings, and promotes them in the rest.
      Then, turning to Antinoues, quick he said--
    Antinoues! as a father for his son
    Takes thought, so thou for me, who bidd'st me chase
    The stranger harshly hence; but God forbid![76]                  480
    Impart to him. I grudge not, but myself
    Exhort thee to it; neither, in this cause,
    Fear thou the Queen, or in the least regard
    Whatever menial throughout all the house
    Of famed Ulysses. Ah! within thy breast
    Dwells no such thought; thou lov'st not to impart
    To others, but to gratify thyself.
      To whom Antinoues answer thus return'd.
    High-soaring and intemp'rate in thy speech
    How hast thou said, Telemachus? Would all                        490
    As much bestow on him, he should not seek
    Admittance here again three months to come.
      So saying, he seized the stool which, banqueting,
    He press'd with his nice feet, and from beneath
    The table forth advanced it into view.
    The rest all gave to him, with bread and flesh
    Filling his wallet, and Ulysses, now,
    Returning to his threshold, there to taste
    The bounty of the Greeks, paused in his way
    Beside Antinoues, whom he thus address'd.                         500
      Kind sir! vouchsafe to me! for thou appear'st
    Not least, but greatest of the Achaians here,
    And hast a kingly look. It might become
    Thee therefore above others to bestow,
    So should I praise thee wheresoe'er I roam.
    I also lived the happy owner once
    Of such a stately mansion, and have giv'n
    To num'rous wand'rers (whencesoe'er they came)
    All that they needed; I was also served
    By many, and enjoy'd all that denotes                            510
    The envied owner opulent and blest.
    But Jove (for so it pleas'd him) hath reduced
    My all to nothing, prompting me, in league
    With rovers of the Deep, to sail afar
    To AEgypt, for my sure destruction there.
    Within th' AEgyptian stream my barks well-oar'd
    I station'd, and, enjoining strict my friends
    To watch them close-attendant at their side,
    Commanded spies into the hill-tops; but they,
    Under the impulse of a spirit rash                               520
    And hot for quarrel, the well-cultur'd fields
    Pillaged of the AEgyptians, captive led
    Their wives and little-ones, and slew the men.
    Ere long, the loud alarm their city reach'd.
    Down came the citizens, by dawn of day,
    With horse and foot and with the gleam of arms
    Filling the plain. Then Jove with panic dread
    Struck all my people; none found courage more
    To stand, for mischiefs swarm'd on ev'ry side.
    There, num'rous by the glitt'ring spear we fell                  530
    Slaughter'd, while others they conducted thence
    Alive to servitude; but me they gave
    To Dmetor, King in Cyprus, Jasus' son;
    He entertained me liberally, and thence
    This land I reach'd, but poor and woe-begone.
      Then answer thus Antinoues harsh return'd.
    What daemon introduced this nuisance here,
    This troubler of our feast? stand yonder, keep
    Due distance from my table, or expect
    To see an AEgypt and a Cyprus worse                               540
    Than those, bold mendicant and void of shame!
    Thou hauntest each, and, inconsid'rate, each
    Gives to thee, because gifts at other's cost
    Are cheap, and, plentifully serv'd themselves,
    They squander, heedless, viands not their own.
      To whom Ulysses while he slow retired.
    Gods! how illib'ral with that specious form!
    Thou wouldst not grant the poor a grain of salt
    From thy own board, who at another's fed
    So nobly, canst thou not spare a crust to me.                    550
      He spake; then raged Antinoues still the more,
    And in wing'd accents, louring, thus replied.
      Take such dismission now as thou deserv'st,
    Opprobrious! hast thou dared to scoff at me?
      So saying, he seized his stool, and on the joint
    Of his right shoulder smote him; firm as rock
    He stood, by no such force to be displaced,
    But silent shook his brows, and dreadful deeds
    Of vengeance ruminating, sought again
    His seat the threshold, where his bag full-charged               560
    He grounded, and the suitors thus address'd.
      Hear now, ye suitors of the matchless Queen,
    My bosom's dictates. Trivial is the harm,
    Scarce felt, if, fighting for his own, his sheep
    Perchance, or beeves, a man receive a blow.
    But me Antinoues struck for that I ask'd
    Food from him merely to appease the pangs
    Of hunger, source of num'rous ills to man.
    If then the poor man have a God t' avenge
    His wrongs, I pray to him that death may seize                   570
    Antinoues, ere his nuptial hour arrive!
      To whom Antinoues answer thus return'd,
    Son of Eupithes. Either seated there
    Or going hence, eat, stranger, and be still;
    Lest for thy insolence, by hand or foot
    We drag thee forth, and thou be flay'd alive.
      He ceased, whom all indignant heard, and thus
    Ev'n his own proud companions censured him.
      Antinoues! thou didst not well to smite
    The wretched vagabond. O thou art doom'd                         580
    For ever, if there be a God in heav'n;[77]
    For, in similitude of strangers oft,
    The Gods, who can with ease all shapes assume,
    Repair to populous cities, where they mark
    The outrageous and the righteous deeds of men.
      So they, for whose reproof he little cared.
    But in his heart Telemachus that blow
    Resented, anguish-torn, yet not a tear
    He shed, but silent shook his brows, and mused
    Terrible things. Penelope, meantime,                             590
    Told of the wand'rer so abused beneath
    Her roof, among her maidens thus exclaim'd.
      So may Apollo, glorious archer, smite
    Thee also. Then Eurynome replied,
      Oh might our pray'rs prevail, none of them all
    Should see bright-charioted Aurora more.
      Her answer'd then Penelope discrete.
    Nurse! they are odious all, for that alike
    All teem with mischief; but Antinoues' looks
    Remind me ever of the gloom of death.                            600
    A stranger hath arrived who, begging, roams
    The house, (for so his penury enjoins)
    The rest have giv'n him, and have fill'd his bag
    With viands, but Antinoues hath bruised
    His shoulder with a foot-stool hurl'd at him.
      While thus the Queen conversing with her train
    In her own chamber sat, Ulysses made
    Plenteous repast. Then, calling to her side
    Eumaeus, thus she signified her will.
      Eumaeus, noble friend! bid now approach                         610
    Yon stranger. I would speak with him, and ask
    If he has seen Ulysses, or have heard
    Tidings, perchance, of the afflicted Chief,
    For much a wand'rer by his garb he seems.
      To whom, Eumaeus, thou didst thus reply.
    Were those Achaians silent, thou shouldst hear,
    O Queen! a tale that would console thy heart.
    Three nights I housed him, and within my cot
    Three days detain'd him, (for his ship he left
    A fugitive, and came direct to me)                               620
    But half untold his hist'ry still remains.
    As when his eye one fixes on a bard
    From heav'n instructed in such themes as charm
    The ear of mortals, ever as he sings
    The people press, insatiable, to hear,
    So, in my cottage, seated at my side,
    That stranger with his tale enchanted me.
    Laertes, he affirms, hath been his guest
    Erewhile in Crete, where Minos' race resides,
    And thence he hath arrived, after great loss,                    630
    A suppliant to the very earth abased;
    He adds, that in Thesprotia's neighbour realm
    He of Ulysses heard, both that he lives,
    And that he comes laden with riches home.
      To whom Penelope, discrete, replied.
    Haste; call him. I would hear, myself, his tale.
    Meantime, let these, or in the palace gate
    Sport jocular, or here; their hearts are light,
    For their possessions are secure; _their_ wine
    None drinks, or eats _their_ viands, save their own,             640
    While my abode, day after day, themselves
    Haunting, my beeves and sheep and fatted goats
    Slay for the banquet, and my casks exhaust
    Extravagant, whence endless waste ensues;
    For no such friend as was Ulysses once
    Have I to expel the mischief. But might he
    Revisit once his native shores again,
    Then, aided by his son, he should avenge,
    Incontinent, the wrongs which now I mourn.
      Then sneezed Telemachus with sudden force,                     650
    That all the palace rang; his mother laugh'd,
    And in wing'd accents thus the swain bespake.
      Haste--bid him hither--hear'st thou not the sneeze
    Propitious of my son? oh might it prove
    A presage of inevitable death
    To all these revellers! may none escape!
    Now mark me well. Should the event his tale
    Confirm, at my own hands he shall receive
    Mantle and tunic both for his reward.
      She spake; he went, and where Ulysses sat                      660
    Arriving, in wing'd accents thus began.
      Penelope, my venerable friend!
    Calls thee, the mother of Telemachus.
    Oppress'd by num'rous troubles, she desires
    To ask thee tidings of her absent Lord.
    And should the event verify thy report,
    Thy meed shall be (a boon which much thou need'st)
    Tunic and mantle; but she gives no more;
    Thy sustenance thou must, as now, obtain,[78]
    Begging it at their hands who chuse to give.                     670
      Then thus Ulysses, Hero toil-inured.
    Eumaeus! readily I can relate
    Truth, and truth only, to the prudent Queen
    Icarius' daughter; for of him I know
    Much, and have suff'red sorrows like his own.
    But dread I feel of this imperious throng
    Perverse, whose riot and outrageous acts
    Of violence echo through the vault of heav'n.
    And, even now, when for no fault of mine
    Yon suitor struck me as I pass'd, and fill'd                     680
    My flesh with pain, neither Telemachus
    Nor any interposed to stay his arm.
    Now, therefore, let Penelope, although
    Impatient, till the sun descend postpone
    Her questions; then she may enquire secure
    When comes her husband, and may nearer place
    My seat to the hearth-side, for thinly clad
    Thou know'st I am, whose aid I first implored.
      He ceas'd; at whose reply Eumaeus sought
    Again the Queen, but ere he yet had pass'd                       690
    The threshold, thus she greeted his return.
      Com'st thou alone, Eumaeus? why delays
    The invited wand'rer? dreads he other harm?
    Or sees he aught that with a bashful awe
    Fills him? the bashful poor are poor indeed.
      To whom, Eumaeus, thou didst thus reply.
    He hath well spoken; none who would decline
    The rudeness of this contumelious throng
    Could answer otherwise; thee he entreats
    To wait till sun-set, and that course, O Queen,                  700
    Thou shalt thyself far more commodious find,
    To hold thy conf'rence with the guest, alone.
      Then answer thus Penelope return'd.
    The stranger, I perceive, is not unwise,
    Whoe'er he be, for on the earth are none
    Proud, insolent, and profligate as these.
      So spake the Queen. Then (all his message told)
    The good Eumaeus to the suitors went
    Again, and with his head inclined toward
    Telemachus, lest others should his words                         710
    Witness, in accents wing'd him thus address'd.
      Friend and kind master! I return to keep
    My herds, and to attend my rural charge,
    Whence we are both sustain'd. Keep thou, meantime,
    All here with vigilance, but chiefly watch
    For thy own good, and save _thyself_ from harm;
    For num'rous here brood mischief, whom the Gods
    Exterminate, ere yet their plots prevail!
      To whom Telemachus, discrete, replied.
    So be it, father! and (thy evening-mess                          720
    Eaten) depart; to-morrow come again,
    Bringing fair victims hither; I will keep,
    I and the Gods, meantime, all here secure.
      He ended; then resumed once more the swain
    His polish'd seat, and, both with wine and food
    Now satiate, to his charge return'd, the court
    Leaving and all the palace throng'd with guests;
    They (for it now was evening) all alike
    Turn'd jovial to the song and to the dance.
