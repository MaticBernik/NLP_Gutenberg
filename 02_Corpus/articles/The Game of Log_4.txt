which means, you know, "some x are y'."
These principles may be applied to all the other
oblongs.  For instance, to represent
"all y' are m'" we should mark the     -------
RIGHT-HAND UPRIGHT OBLONG (the one    |       |
that has the attribute y') thus:--    |---    |
                                      | 0 |   |
                                      |---|-1-|
                                      | 0 |   |
                                      |---    |
                                      |       |
                                       -------
and, if we were told to interpret the lower half of the cupboard,
marked as follows, with regard to x and y,
                   -------------------
                  |   |     |     |   |
                  |   |     |  0  |   |
                  |   |     |     |   |
                  |    -----|-----    |
                  | 1       |       0 |
                   -------------------
we should transfer it to the smaller Diagram thus,
                      -----------
                     |     |     |
                     |  1  |  0  |
                     |     |     |
                      -----------
and read it "all x' are y."
Two more remarks about Propositions need to be made.
One is that, in every Proposition beginning with "some" or "all",
the ACTUAL EXISTENCE of the 'Subject' is asserted.  If, for instance,
I say "all misers are selfish," I mean that misers ACTUALLY EXIST.
If I wished to avoid making this assertion, and merely to state
the LAW that miserliness necessarily involves selfishness, I should
say "no misers are unselfish" which does not assert that any misers
exist at all, but merely that, if any DID exist, they WOULD be
selfish.
The other is that, when a Proposition begins with "some" or "no",
and contains more that two Attributes, these Attributes may be
re-arranged, and shifted from one Term to the other, "ad libitum."
For example, "some abc are def" may be re-arranged as "some bf are
acde," each being equivalent to "some Things are abcdef".  Again "No
wise old men are rash and reckless gamblers" may be re-arranged as
"No rash old gamblers are wise and reckless," each being equivalent
to "No men are wise old rash reckless gamblers."
2.  Syllogisms
Now suppose we divide our Universe of Things in three ways, with regard
to three different Attributes.  Out of these three Attributes, we
may make up three different couples (for instance, if they were a,
b, c, we might make up the three couples ab, ac, bc).  Also suppose
we have two Propositions given us, containing two of these three
couples, and that from them we can prove a third Proposition containing
the third couple.  (For example, if we divide our Universe for m,
x, and y; and if we have the two Propositions given us, "no m are
x'" and "all m' are y", containing the two couples mx and my, it
might be possible to prove from them a third Proposition, containing
x and y.)
In such a case we call the given Propositions 'THE PREMISSES', the
third one 'THE CONCLUSION' and the whole set 'A SYLLOGISM'.
Evidently, ONE of the Attributes must occur in both Premisses; or
else one must occur in ONE Premiss, and its CONTRADICTORY in the
other.
In the first case (when, for example, the Premisses are "some m
are x" and "no m are y'") the Term, which occurs twice, is called
'THE MIDDLE TERM', because it serves as a sort of link between the
other two Terms.
