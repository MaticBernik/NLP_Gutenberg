LADY WINDERMERE.  You are mad!  [_Rises_.]
LORD WINDERMERE.  I entreat you.  People may chatter about her, do
chatter about her, of course, but they dont know anything definite
against her.  She has been to several housesnot to houses where you
would go, I admit, but still to houses where women who are in what is
called Society nowadays do go.  That does not content her.  She wants you
to receive her once.
LADY WINDERMERE.  As a triumph for her, I suppose?
LORD WINDERMERE.  No; but because she knows that you are a good womanand
that if she comes here once she will have a chance of a happier, a surer
life than she has had.  She will make no further effort to know you.
Wont you help a woman who is trying to get back?
LADY WINDERMERE.  No!  If a woman really repents, she never wishes to
return to the society that has made or seen her ruin.
LORD WINDERMERE.  I beg of you.
LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Crossing to door R._]  I am going to dress for
dinner, and dont mention the subject again this evening.  Arthur [_going
to him C._], you fancy because I have no father or mother that I am alone
in the world, and that you can treat me as you choose.  You are wrong, I
have friends, many friends.
LORD WINDERMERE.  [_L.C._]  Margaret, you are talking foolishly,
recklessly.  I wont argue with you, but I insist upon your asking Mrs.
Erlynne to-night.
LADY WINDERMERE.  [_R.C._]  I shall do nothing of the kind.  [_Crossing
L.C._]
LORD WINDERMERE.  You refuse?  [_C._]
LADY WINDERMERE.  Absolutely!
LORD WINDERMERE.  Ah, Margaret, do this for my sake; it is her last
chance.
LADY WINDERMERE.  What has that to do with me?
LORD WINDERMERE.  How hard good women are!
LADY WINDERMERE.  How weak bad men are!
LORD WINDERMERE.  Margaret, none of us men may be good enough for the
women we marrythat is quite truebut you dont imagine I would everoh,
the suggestion is monstrous!
LADY WINDERMERE.  Why should _you_ be different from other men?  I am
told that there is hardly a husband in London who does not waste his life
over _some_ shameful passion.
LORD WINDERMERE.  I am not one of them.
LADY WINDERMERE.  I am not sure of that!
LORD WINDERMERE.  You are sure in your heart.  But dont make chasm after
chasm between us.  God knows the last few minutes have thrust us wide
enough apart.  Sit down and write the card.
LADY WINDERMERE.  Nothing in the whole world would induce me.
LORD WINDERMERE.  [_Crossing to bureau_.]  Then I will!  [_Rings electric
bell_, _sits and writes card_.]
LADY WINDERMERE.  You are going to invite this woman?  [_Crossing to
him_.]
LORD WINDERMERE.  Yes.  [_Pause_.  _Enter_ PARKER.]  Parker!
PARKER.  Yes, my lord.  [_Comes down L.C._]
LORD WINDERMERE.  Have this note sent to Mrs. Erlynne at No. 84A Curzon
Street.  [_Crossing to L.C. and giving note to_ PARKER.]  There is no
answer!
                                                      [_Exit_ PARKER _C._]
LADY WINDERMERE.  Arthur, if that woman comes here, I shall insult her.
