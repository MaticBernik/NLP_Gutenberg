LORD WINDERMERE.  Margaret, dont say that.
LADY WINDERMERE.  I mean it.
LORD WINDERMERE.  Child, if you did such a thing, theres not a woman in
London who wouldnt pity you.
LADY WINDERMERE.  There is not a _good_ woman in London who would not
applaud me.  We have been too lax.  We must make an example.  I propose
to begin to-night.  [_Picking up fan_.]  Yes, you gave me this fan
to-day; it was your birthday present.  If that woman crosses my
threshold, I shall strike her across the face with it.
LORD WINDERMERE.  Margaret, you couldnt do such a thing.
LADY WINDERMERE.  You dont know me!  [_Moves R._]
[_Enter_ PARKER.]
Parker!
PARKER.  Yes, my lady.
LADY WINDERMERE.  I shall dine in my own room.  I dont want dinner, in
fact.  See that everything is ready by half-past ten.  And, Parker, be
sure you pronounce the names of the guests very distinctly to-night.
Sometimes you speak so fast that I miss them.  I am particularly anxious
to hear the names quite clearly, so as to make no mistake.  You
understand, Parker?
PARKER.  Yes, my lady.
LADY WINDERMERE.  That will do!
                                                      [_Exit_ PARKER _C._]
[_Speaking to_ LORD WINDERMERE.]  Arthur, if that woman comes hereI warn
you
LORD WINDERMERE.  Margaret, youll ruin us!
LADY WINDERMERE.  Us!  From this moment my life is separate from yours.
But if you wish to avoid a public scandal, write at once to this woman,
and tell her that I forbid her to come here!
LORD WINDERMERE.  I will notI cannotshe must come!
LADY WINDERMERE.  Then I shall do exactly as I have said.  [_Goes R._]
You leave me no choice.
                                                               [_Exit R._]
LORD WINDERMERE.  [_Calling after her_.]  Margaret!  Margaret!  [_A
pause_.]  My God!  What shall I do?  I dare not tell her who this woman
really is.  The shame would kill her.  [_Sinks down into a chair and
buries his face in his hands_.]

_Drawing-room in Lord Windermeres house_.  _Door R.U. opening into

_flowers_, _and brilliant lights_.  _Room crowded with guests_.  _Lady
Windermere is receiving them_.
DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  [_Up C._]  So strange Lord Windermere isnt here.
Mr. Hopper is very late, too.  You have kept those five dances for him,
Agatha?  [_Comes down_.]
LADY AGATHA.  Yes, mamma.
DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  [_Sitting on sofa_.]  Just let me see your card.
Im so glad Lady Windermere has revived cards.Theyre a mothers only
safeguard.  You dear simple little thing!  [_Scratches out two names_.]
No nice girl should ever waltz with such particularly younger sons!  It
looks so fast!  The last two dances you might pass on the terrace with
Mr. Hopper.
[_Enter_ MR. DUMBY _and_ LADY PLYMDALE _from the ball-room_.]
LADY AGATHA.  Yes, mamma.
DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  [_Fanning herself_.]  The air is so pleasant there.
PARKER.  Mrs. Cowper-Cowper.  Lady Stutfield.  Sir James Royston.  Mr.
Guy Berkeley.
