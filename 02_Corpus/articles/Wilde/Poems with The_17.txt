   The turtle now has ceased to call
      Upon her crimson-footed groom,
   The grey wolf prowls about the stall,
   The lilys singing seneschal
   Sleeps in the lily-bell, and all
      The violet hills are lost in gloom.
   O risen moon!  O holy moon!
      Stand on the top of Helice,
      And if my own true love you see,
   Ah! if you see the purple shoon,
   The hazel crook, the lads brown hair,
      The goat-skin wrapped about his arm,
   Tell him that I am waiting where
      The rushlight glimmers in the Farm.
   The falling dew is cold and chill,
      And no bird sings in Arcady,
   The little fauns have left the hill,
   Even the tired daffodil
   Has closed its gilded doors, and still
      My lover comes not back to me.
   False moon!  False moon!  O waning moon!
      Where is my own true lover gone,
      Where are the lips vermilion,
   The shepherds crook, the purple shoon?
   Why spread that silver pavilion,
      Why wear that veil of drifting mist?
   Ah! thou hast young Endymion,
      Thou hast the lips that should be kissed!
LA BELLA DONNA DELLA MIA MENTE
   MY limbs are wasted with a flame,
      My feet are sore with travelling,
   For, calling on my Ladys name,
      My lips have now forgot to sing.
   O Linnet in the wild-rose brake
      Strain for my Love thy melody,
   O Lark sing louder for loves sake,
      My gentle Lady passeth by.
   She is too fair for any man
      To see or hold his hearts delight,
   Fairer than Queen or courtesan
      Or moonlit water in the night.
   Her hair is bound with myrtle leaves,
      (Green leaves upon her golden hair!)
   Green grasses through the yellow sheaves
      Of autumn corn are not more fair.
   Her little lips, more made to kiss
      Than to cry bitterly for pain,
   Are tremulous as brook-water is,
      Or roses after evening rain.
   Her neck is like white melilote
      Flushing for pleasure of the sun,
   The throbbing of the linnets throat
      Is not so sweet to look upon.
   As a pomegranate, cut in twain,
      White-seeded, is her crimson mouth,
   Her cheeks are as the fading stain
      Where the peach reddens to the south.
   O twining hands!  O delicate
      White body made for love and pain!
   O House of love!  O desolate
      Pale flower beaten by the rain!
CHANSON
   A RING of gold and a milk-white dove
      Are goodly gifts for thee,
   And a hempen rope for your own love
      To hang upon a tree.
   For you a House of Ivory,
      (Roses are white in the rose-bower)!
   A narrow bed for me to lie,
      (White, O white, is the hemlock flower)!
   Myrtle and jessamine for you,
      (O the red rose is fair to see)!
   For me the cypress and the rue,
      (Finest of all is rosemary)!
   For you three lovers of your hand,
      (Green grass where a man lies dead)!
   For me three paces on the sand,
      (Plant lilies at my head)!
CHARMIDES
                                     I.
   HE was a Grecian lad, who coming home
      With pulpy figs and wine from Sicily
   Stood at his galleys prow, and let the foam
      Blow through his crisp brown curls unconsciously,
   And holding wave and wind in boys despite
   Peered from his dripping seat across the wet and stormy night.
