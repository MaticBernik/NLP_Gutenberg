   And let
   The floodgates of my passion swell and burst
   Till, like the wave when rivers overflow
   That sweeps the forest and the farm away,
   Love in the splendid avalanche of its might
   Swept my life with it?  Must I drop by drop
   Gather these waters back and seal them up?
   Alas!  Each drop will be a tear, and so
   Will with its saltness make life very bitter.
GUIDO
   I pray you speak no more, for I must go
   Forth from your life and love, and make a way
   On which you cannot follow.
DUCHESS
   I have heard
   That sailors dying of thirst upon a raft,
   Poor castaways upon a lonely sea,
   Dream of green fields and pleasant water-courses,
   And then wake up with red thirst in their throats,
   And die more miserably because sleep
   Has cheated them: so they die cursing sleep
   For having sent them dreams: I will not curse you
   Though I am cast away upon the sea
   Which men call Desolation.
GUIDO
   O God, God!
DUCHESS
   But you will stay: listen, I love you, Guido.
                                                   [_She waits a little_.]
   Is echo dead, that when I say I love you
   There is no answer?
GUIDO
   Everything is dead,
   Save one thing only, which shall die to-night!
DUCHESS
   If you are going, touch me not, but go.
                                                           [_Exit_ GUIDO.]
   Barrier!  Barrier!
   Why did he say there was a barrier?
   There is no barrier between us two.
   He lied to me, and shall I for that reason
   Loathe what I love, and what I worshipped, hate?
   I think we women do not love like that.
   For if I cut his image from my heart,
   My heart would, like a bleeding pilgrim, follow
   That image through the world, and call it back
   With little cries of love.
  [_Enter_ DUKE _equipped for the chase_, _with falconers and hounds_.]
DUKE
   Madam, you keep us waiting;
   You keep my dogs waiting.
DUCHESS
   I will not ride to-day.
DUKE
   How now, whatÂ’s this?
DUCHESS
   My Lord, I cannot go.
DUKE
   What, pale face, do you dare to stand against me?
   Why, I could set you on a sorry jade
   And lead you through the town, till the low rabble
   You feed toss up their hats and mock at you.
DUCHESS
   Have you no word of kindness ever for me?
DUKE
   I hold you in the hollow of my hand
   And have no need on you to waste kind words.
DUCHESS
   Well, I will go.
DUKE [_slapping his boot with his whip_]
   No, I have changed my mind,
   You will stay here, and like a faithful wife
   Watch from the window for our coming back.
   Were it not dreadful if some accident
   By chance should happen to your loving Lord?
   Come, gentlemen, my hounds begin to chafe,
   And I chafe too, having a patient wife.
   Where is young Guido?
MAFFIO
   My liege, I have not seen him
   For a full hour past.
DUKE
   It matters not,
   I dare say I shall see him soon enough.
   Well, Madam, you will sit at home and spin.
   I do protest, sirs, the domestic virtues
   Are often very beautiful in others.
