LORD GORING.  I like you immensely.
MABEL CHILTERN.  Well, I wish you'd show it in a more marked way!  [_They
go downstairs_.]
MRS. MARCHMONT.  Olivia, I have a curious feeling of absolute faintness.
I think I should like some supper very much.  I know I should like some
supper.
LADY BASILDON.  I am positively dying for supper, Margaret!
MRS. MARCHMONT.  Men are so horribly selfish, they never think of these
things.
LADY BASILDON.  Men are grossly material, grossly material!
[_The_ VICOMTE DE NANJAC _enters from the music-room with some other
guests_.  _After having carefully examined all the people present_, _he
approaches_ LADY BASILDON.]
VICOMTE DE NANJAC.  May I have the honour of taking you down to supper,
Comtesse?
LADY BASILDON.  [_Coldly_.]  I never take supper, thank you, Vicomte.
[_The_ VICOMTE _is about to retire_.  LADY BASILDON, _seeing this_,
_rises at once and takes his arm_.]  But I will come down with you with
pleasure.
VICOMTE DE NANJAC.  I am so fond of eating!  I am very English in all my
tastes.
LADY BASILDON.  You look quite English, Vicomte, quite English.
[_They pass out_.  MR. MONTFORD, _a perfectly groomed young dandy_,
_approaches_ MRS. MARCHMONT.]
MR. MONTFORD.  Like some supper, Mrs. Marchmont?
MRS. MARCHMONT.  [_Languidly_.]  Thank you, Mr. Montford, I never touch
supper.  [_Rises hastily and takes his arm_.]  But I will sit beside you,
and watch you.
MR. MONTFORD.  I don't know that I like being watched when I am eating!
MRS. MARCHMONT.  Then I will watch some one else.
MR. MONTFORD.  I don't know that I should like that either.
MRS. MARCHMONT.  [_Severely_.]  Pray, Mr. Montford, do not make these
painful scenes of jealousy in public!
[_They go downstairs with the other guests_, _passing_ SIR ROBERT
CHILTERN _and_ MRS. CHEVELEY, _who now enter_.]
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  And are you going to any of our country houses
before you leave England, Mrs. Cheveley?
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Oh, no!  I can't stand your English house-parties.  In
England people actually try to be brilliant at breakfast.  That is so
dreadful of them!  Only dull people are brilliant at breakfast.  And then
the family skeleton is always reading family prayers.  My stay in England
really depends on you, Sir Robert.  [_Sits down on the sofa_.]
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Taking a seat beside her_.]  Seriously?
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Quite seriously.  I want to talk to you about a great
political and financial scheme, about this Argentine Canal Company, in
fact.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  What a tedious, practical subject for you to talk
about, Mrs. Cheveley!
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Oh, I like tedious, practical subjects.  What I don't
like are tedious, practical people.  There is a wide difference.
Besides, you are interested, I know, in International Canal schemes.  You
were Lord Radley's secretary, weren't you, when the Government bought the
Suez Canal shares?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Yes.  But the Suez Canal was a very great and
splendid undertaking.  It gave us our direct route to India.  It had
imperial value.  It was necessary that we should have control.  This
Argentine scheme is a commonplace Stock Exchange swindle.
