ROSA MYSTICA
REQUIESCAT
   TREAD lightly, she is near
      Under the snow,
   Speak gently, she can hear
      The daisies grow.
   All her bright golden hair
      Tarnished with rust,
   She that was young and fair
      Fallen to dust.
   Lily-like, white as snow,
      She hardly knew
   She was a woman, so
      Sweetly she grew.
   Coffin-board, heavy stone,
      Lie on her breast,
   I vex my heart alone,
      She is at rest.
   Peace, Peace, she cannot hear
      Lyre or sonnet,
   All my lifes buried here,
      Heap earth upon it.
AVIGNON.
SONNET ON APPROACHING ITALY
   I REACHED the Alps: the soul within me burned,
      Italia, my Italia, at thy name:
      And when from out the mountains heart I came
   And saw the land for which my life had yearned,
   I laughed as one who some great prize had earned:
      And musing on the marvel of thy fame
      I watched the day, till marked with wounds of flame
   The turquoise sky to burnished gold was turned.
   The pine-trees waved as waves a womans hair,
      And in the orchards every twining spray
      Was breaking into flakes of blossoming foam:
   But when I knew that far away at Rome
      In evil bonds a second Peter lay,
      I wept to see the land so very fair.
TURIN.
SAN MINIATO
      SEE, I have climbed the mountain side
      Up to this holy house of God,
      Where once that Angel-Painter trod
   Who saw the heavens opened wide,
      And throned upon the crescent moon
      The Virginal white Queen of Grace,
      Mary! could I but see thy face
   Death could not come at all too soon.
      O crowned by God with thorns and pain!
      Mother of Christ!  O mystic wife!
      My heart is weary of this life
   And over-sad to sing again.
      O crowned by God with love and flame!
      O crowned by Christ the Holy One!
      O listen ere the searching sun
   Show to the world my sin and shame.
AVE MARIA GRATIA PLENA
   WAS this His coming!  I had hoped to see
      A scene of wondrous glory, as was told
      Of some great God who in a rain of gold
   Broke open bars and fell on Danae:
   Or a dread vision as when Semele
      Sickening for love and unappeased desire
      Prayed to see Gods clear body, and the fire
   Caught her brown limbs and slew her utterly:
   With such glad dreams I sought this holy place,
      And now with wondering eyes and heart I stand
      Before this supreme mystery of Love:
   Some kneeling girl with passionless pale face,
      An angel with a lily in his hand,
      And over both the white wings of a Dove.
FLORENCE.
ITALIA
   ITALIA! thou art fallen, though with sheen
      Of battle-spears thy clamorous armies stride
      From the north Alps to the Sicilian tide!
   Ay! fallen, though the nations hail thee Queen
   Because rich gold in every town is seen,
      And on thy sapphire-lake in tossing pride
      Of wind-filled vans thy myriad galleys ride
   Beneath one flag of red and white and green.
   O Fair and Strong!  O Strong and Fair in vain!
      Look southward where Romes desecrated town
      Lies mourning for her God-anointed King!
   Look heaven-ward! shall God allow this thing?
      Nay! but some flame-girt Raphael shall come down,
      And smite the Spoiler with the sword of pain.
