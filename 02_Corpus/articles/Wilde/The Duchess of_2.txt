COUNT BARDI [_aside_]
   Here is some bitter arrow for us, sure.
DUKE
   Why, every man among them has his price,
   Although, to do them justice, some of them
   Are quite expensive.
COUNT BARDI [_aside_]
   There it comes indeed.
DUKE
   So be not honest; eccentricity
   Is not a thing should ever be encouraged,
   Although, in this dull stupid age of ours,
   The most eccentric thing a man can do
   Is to have brains, then the mob mocks at him;
   And for the mob, despise it as I do,
   I hold its bubble praise and windy favours
   In such account, that popularity
   Is the one insult I have never suffered.
MAFFIO [_aside_]
   He has enough of hate, if he needs that.
DUKE
   Have prudence; in your dealings with the world
   Be not too hasty; act on the second thought,
   First impulses are generally good.
GUIDO [_aside_]
   Surely a toad sits on his lips, and spills its venom there.
DUKE
   See thou hast enemies,
   Else will the world think very little of thee;
   It is its test of power; yet see thou showst
   A smiling mask of friendship to all men,
   Until thou hast them safely in thy grip,
   Then thou canst crush them.
GUIDO [_aside_]
   O wise philosopher!
   That for thyself dost dig so deep a grave.
MORANZONE [_to him_]
   Dost thou mark his words?
GUIDO
   Oh, be thou sure I do.
DUKE
   And be not over-scrupulous; clean hands
   With nothing in them make a sorry show.
   If you would have the lions share of life
   You must wear the foxs skin.  Oh, it will fit you;
   It is a coat which fitteth every man.
GUIDO
   Your Grace, I shall remember.
DUKE
   That is well, boy, well.
   I would not have about me shallow fools,
   Who with mean scruples weigh the gold of life,
   And faltering, paltering, end by failure; failure,
   The only crime which I have not committed:
   I would have _men_ about me.  As for conscience,
   Conscience is but the name which cowardice
   Fleeing from battle scrawls upon its shield.
   You understand me, boy?
GUIDO
   I do, your Grace,
   And will in all things carry out the creed
   Which you have taught me.
MAFFIO
   I never heard your Grace
   So much in the vein for preaching; let the Cardinal
   Look to his laurels, sir.
DUKE
   The Cardinal!
   Men follow my creed, and they gabble his.
   I do not think much of the Cardinal;
   Although he is a holy churchman, and
   I quite admit his dulness.  Well, sir, from now
   We count you of our household
[_He holds out his hand for_ GUIDO _to kiss_.  GUIDO _starts back in
horror_, _but at a gesture from_ COUNT MORANZONE, _kneels and kisses
it_.]
   We will see
   That you are furnished with such equipage
   As doth befit your honour and our state.
GUIDO
   I thank your Grace most heartily.
DUKE
   Tell me again
   What is your name?
GUIDO
   Guido Ferranti, sir.
DUKE
   And you are Mantuan?  Look to your wives, my lords,
   When such a gallant comes to Padua.
   Thou dost well to laugh, Count Bardi; I have noted
   How merry is that husband by whose hearth
   Sits an uncomely wife.
