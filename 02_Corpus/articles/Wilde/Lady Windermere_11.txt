DUMBY.  [_With perfect nonchalance_.]  Delighted!
[LADY PLYMDALE _glares with indignation at_ MR. DUMBY.  LORD AUGUSTUS
_follows_ MRS. ERLYNNE _and_ LORD WINDERMERE _into the ball-room holding
bouquet_.]
LADY PLYMDALE.  [_To_ MR. DUMBY.]  What an absolute brute you are!  I
never can believe a word you say!  Why did you tell me you didnt know
her?  What do you mean by calling on her three times running?  You are
not to go to lunch there; of course you understand that?
DUMBY.  My dear Laura, I wouldnt dream of going!
LADY PLYMDALE.  You havent told me her name yet!  Who is she?
DUMBY.  [_Coughs slightly and smooths his hair_.]  Shes a Mrs. Erlynne.
LADY PLYMDALE.  That woman!
DUMBY.  Yes; that is what every one calls her.
LADY PLYMDALE.  How very interesting!  How intensely interesting!  I
really must have a good stare at her.  [_Goes to door of ball-room and
looks in_.]  I have heard the most shocking things about her.  They say
she is ruining poor Windermere.  And Lady Windermere, who goes in for
being so proper, invites her!  How extremely amusing!  It takes a
thoroughly good woman to do a thoroughly stupid thing.  You are to lunch
there on Friday!
DUMBY.  Why?
LADY PLYMDALE.  Because I want you to take my husband with you.  He has
been so attentive lately, that he has become a perfect nuisance.  Now,
this woman is just the thing for him.  Hell dance attendance upon her as
long as she lets him, and wont bother me.  I assure you, women of that
kind are most useful.  They form the basis of other peoples marriages.
DUMBY.  What a mystery you are!
LADY PLYMDALE.  [_Looking at him_.]  I wish _you_ were!
DUMBY.  I amto myself.  I am the only person in the world I should like
to know thoroughly; but I dont see any chance of it just at present.
[_They pass into the ball-room_, _and_ LADY WINDERMERE _and_ LORD
DARLINGTON _enter from the terrace_.]
LADY WINDERMERE.  Yes.  Her coming here is monstrous, unbearable.  I know
now what you meant to-day at tea-time.  Why didnt you tell me right out?
You should have!
LORD DARLINGTON.  I couldnt!  A man cant tell these things about
another man!  But if I had known he was going to make you ask her here
to-night, I think I would have told you.  That insult, at any rate, you
would have been spared.
LADY WINDERMERE.  I did not ask her.  He insisted on her comingagainst
my entreatiesagainst my commands.  Oh! the house is tainted for me!  I
feel that every woman here sneers at me as she dances by with my husband.
What have I done to deserve this?  I gave him all my life.  He took
itused itspoiled it!  I am degraded in my own eyes; and I lack
courageI am a coward!  [_Sits down on sofa_.]
LORD DARLINGTON.  If I know you at all, I know that you cant live with a
man who treats you like this!  What sort of life would you have with him?
You would feel that he was lying to you every moment of the day.  You
would feel that the look in his eyes was false, his voice false, his
touch false, his passion false.  He would come to you when he was weary
of others; you would have to comfort him.  He would come to you when he
was devoted to others; you would have to charm him.  You would have to be
to him the mask of his real life, the cloak to hide his secret.
