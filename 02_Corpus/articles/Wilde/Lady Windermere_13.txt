LADY WINDERMERE.  Ah, give me time to think.  I cannot answer you now.
[_Passes her hand nervously over her brow_.]
LORD DARLINGTON.  It must be now or not at all.
LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Rising from the sofa_.]  Then, not at all!  [_A
pause_.]
LORD DARLINGTON.  You break my heart!
LADY WINDERMERE.  Mine is already broken.  [_A pause_.]
LORD DARLINGTON.  To-morrow I leave England.  This is the last time I
shall ever look on you.  You will never see me again.  For one moment our
lives metour souls touched.  They must never meet or touch again.
Good-bye, Margaret.  [_Exit_.]
LADY WINDERMERE.  How alone I am in life!  How terribly alone!
[_The music stops_.  _Enter the_ DUCHESS OF BERWICK _and_ LORD PAISLEY
_laughing and talking_.  _Other guests come on from ball-room_.]
DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Dear Margaret, Ive just been having such a
delightful chat with Mrs. Erlynne.  I am so sorry for what I said to you
this afternoon about her.  Of course, she must be all right if _you_
invite her.  A most attractive woman, and has such sensible views on
life.  Told me she entirely disapproved of people marrying more than
once, so I feel quite safe about poor Augustus.  Cant imagine why people
speak against her.  Its those horrid nieces of minethe Saville
girlstheyre always talking scandal.  Still, I should go to Homburg,
dear, I really should.  She is just a little too attractive.  But where
is Agatha?  Oh, there she is:  [LADY AGATHA _and_ MR. HOPPER _enter from
terrace L.U.E._]  Mr. Hopper, I am very, very angry with you.  You have
taken Agatha out on the terrace, and she is so delicate.
HOPPER.  Awfully sorry, Duchess.  We went out for a moment and then got
chatting together.
DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  [_C._]  Ah, about dear Australia, I suppose?
HOPPER.  Yes!
DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Agatha, darling!  [_Beckons her over_.]
LADY AGATHA.  Yes, mamma!
DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  [_Aside_.]  Did Mr. Hopper definitely
LADY AGATHA.  Yes, mamma.
DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  And what answer did you give him, dear child?
LADY AGATHA.  Yes, mamma.
DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  [_Affectionately_.]  My dear one!  You always say
the right thing.  Mr. Hopper!  James!  Agatha has told me everything.
How cleverly you have both kept your secret.
HOPPER.  You dont mind my taking Agatha off to Australia, then, Duchess?
DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  [_Indignantly_.]  To Australia?  Oh, dont mention
that dreadful vulgar place.
HOPPER.  But she said shed like to come with me.
DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  [_Severely_.]  Did you say that, Agatha?
LADY AGATHA.  Yes, mamma.
DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Agatha, you say the most silly things possible.  I
think on the whole that Grosvenor Square would be a more healthy place to
reside in.  There are lots of vulgar people live in Grosvenor Square, but
at any rate there are no horrid kangaroos crawling about.  But well talk
about that to-morrow.  James, you can take Agatha down.  Youll come to
lunch, of course, James.  At half-past one, instead of two.  The Duke
will wish to say a few words to you, I am sure.
