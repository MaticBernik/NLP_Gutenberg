GEN. Yes. But, your Highness--
ALEX. (_haughtily_). General, they are my friends, that is enough. And,
General, not a word of this little adventure here, you understand. I
shall rely on you.
GEN. I shall not forget, Prince. But shall we not see you back to the
palace? The State ball is almost over and you are expected.
ALEX. I shall be there; but I shall return alone. Remember, not a word
about my strolling players.
GEN. Or your pretty gipsy, eh, Prince? your pretty gipsy! I' faith, I
should like to see her before I go; she has such fine eyes through her
mask. Well, good night, your Highness; good night.
ALEX. Good night, General.
(_Exit GENERAL and the soldiers._)
VERA (_throwing off her mask_). Saved! and by you!
ALEX. (_clasping her hand_). Brothers, you trust me now?
TABLEAU.
END OF ACT I.
ACT II.
SCENE.--_Council Chamber in the Emperor's Palace, hung with yellow
tapestry. Table, with chair of State, set for the Czar; window behind,
opening on to a balcony. As the scene progresses the light outside gets
darker._
_Present._--PRINCE PAUL MARALOFFSKI, PRINCE PETROVITCH, COUNT ROUVALOFF,
BARON RAFF, COUNT PETOUCHOF.
PRINCE PETRO. So our young scatter-brained Czarevitch has been forgiven
at last, and is to take his seat here again.
PRINCE PAUL. Yes; if that is not meant as an extra punishment. For my
own part, at least, I find these Cabinet Councils extremely exhausting.
PRINCE PETRO. Naturally; you are always speaking.
PRINCE PAUL. No; I think it must be that I have to listen sometimes.
COUNT R. Still, anything is better than being kept in a sort of prison,
like he was--never allowed to go out into the world.
PRINCE PAUL. My dear Count, for romantic young people like he is, the
world always looks best at a distance; and a prison where one's allowed
to order one's own dinner is not at all a bad place. (_Enter the
CZAREVITCH. The courtiers rise._) Ah! good afternoon, Prince. Your
Highness is looking a little pale to-day.
CZARE. (_slowly, after a pause_). I want change of air.
PRINCE PAUL (_smiling_). A most revolutionary sentiment! Your Imperial
father would highly disapprove of any reforms with the thermometer in
Russia.
CZARE. (_bitterly_). My Imperial father had kept me for six months in
this dungeon of a palace. This morning he has me suddenly woke up to see
some wretched Nihilists hung; it sickened me, the bloody butchery,
though it was a noble thing to see how well these men can die.
PRINCE PAUL. When you are as old as I am, Prince, you will understand
that there are few things easier than to live badly and to die well.
CZARE. Easy to die well! A lesson experience cannot have taught you,
whatever you may know of a bad life.
PRINCE PAUL (_shrugging his shoulders_). Experience, the name men give
to their mistakes. I never commit any.
CZARE. (_bitterly_). No; crimes are more in your line.
PRINCE PETRO. (_to the CZAREVITCH_). The Emperor was a good deal
agitated about your late appearance at the ball last night, Prince.
