For Aristotle, like all Greek thinkers, found his ideal within the walls
of the _<U+03C0><U+03CC><U+03BB><U+03B9><U+03C2>_, yet perhaps in his remark that a united Greece would rule
the world we may discern some anticipation of that federal union of free
states into one consolidated empire which, more than the _<U+03C0><U+03CC><U+03BB><U+03B9><U+03C2>_, is to
our eyes the ultimately perfect polity.
How far Aristotle was justified in regarding the family as the ultimate
unit, with the materials afforded to him by Greek literature, I have
already noticed.  Besides, Aristotle, I may remark, had he reflected on
the meaning of that Athenian law which, while prohibiting marriage with a
uterine sister, permitted it with a sister-german, or on the common
tradition in Athens that before the time of Cecrops children bore their
mothers names, or on some of the Spartan regulations, could hardly have
failed to see the universality of kinsmanship through women in early
days, and the late appearance of monandry.  Yet, while he missed this
point, in common, it must be acknowledged, with many modern writers, such
as Sir Henry Maine, it is essentially as an explorer of inductive
instances that we recognise his improvement on Plato.  The treatise _<U+03C0><U+03B5><U+03C1><U+1F76>
<U+03C0><U+03BF><U+03BB><U+03B9><U+03C4><U+03B5><U+03AF><U+03C9><U+03BD>_, did it remain to us in its entirety, would have been one of
the most valuable landmarks in the progress of historical criticism, and
the first scientific treatise on the science of comparative politics.
A few fragments still remain to us, in one of which we find Aristotle
appealing to the authority of an ancient inscription on the Disk of
Iphitus, one of the most celebrated Greek antiquities, to corroborate
his theory of the Lycurgean revival of the Olympian festival; while his
enormous research is evinced in the elaborate explanation he gives of the
historical origin of proverbs such as _<U+03BF><U+1F50><U+03B4><U+03B5><U+1FD6><U+03C2> µ<U+03AD><U+03B3><U+03B1><U+03C2> <U+03BA><U+03B1><U+03BA><U+1F78><U+03C2> <U+1F30><U+03C7><U+03B8><U+1FE6><U+03C2>_, of
religious songs like the _<U+1F30><U+1FF6>µ<U+03B5><U+03BD> <U+1F10><U+03C2> <U+1F08><U+03B8><U+03AE><U+03BD><U+03B1><U+03C2>_ of the Botticean virgins, or
the praises of love and war.
And, finally, it is to be observed how much wider than Platos his theory
of the origin of society is.  They both rest on a psychological basis,
but Aristotles recognition of the capacity for progress and the tendency
towards a higher life shows how much deeper his knowledge of human nature
was.
In imitation of these two philosophers, Polybius gives an account of the
origin of society in the opening to his philosophy of history.  Somewhat
in the spirit of Plato, he imagines that after one of the cyclic deluges
which sweep off mankind at stated periods and annihilate all pre-existing
civilisation, the few surviving members of humanity coalesce for mutual
protection, and, as in the case with ordinary animals, the one most
remarkable for physical strength is elected king.  In a short time, owing
to the workings of sympathy and the desire of approbation, the moral
qualities begin to make their appearance, and intellectual instead of
bodily excellence becomes the qualification for sovereignty.
Other points, as the rise of law and the like, are dwelt on in a somewhat
modern spirit, and although Polybius seems not to have employed the
inductive method of research in this question, or rather, I should say,
of the hierarchical order of the rational progress of ideas in life, he
is not far removed from what the laborious investigations of modern
travellers have given us.
