LORD GORING.  I wonder who dropped it.
MABEL CHILTERN.  It is a beautiful brooch.
LORD GORING.  It is a handsome bracelet.
MABEL CHILTERN.  It isn't a bracelet.  It's a brooch.
LORD GORING.  It can be used as a bracelet.  [_Takes it from her_, _and_,
_pulling out a green letter-case_, _puts the ornament carefully in it_,
_and replaces the whole thing in his breast-pocket with the most perfect
sang froid_.]
MABEL CHILTERN.  What are you doing?
LORD GORING.  Miss Mabel, I am going to make a rather strange request to
you.
MABEL CHILTERN.  [_Eagerly_.]  Oh, pray do!  I have been waiting for it
all the evening.
LORD GORING.  [_Is a little taken aback_, _but recovers himself_.]  Don't
mention to anybody that I have taken charge of this brooch.  Should any
one write and claim it, let me know at once.
MABEL CHILTERN.  That is a strange request.
LORD GORING.  Well, you see I gave this brooch to somebody once, years
ago.
MABEL CHILTERN.  You did?
LORD GORING.  Yes.
[LADY CHILTERN _enters alone_.  _The other guests have gone_.]
MABEL CHILTERN.  Then I shall certainly bid you good-night.  Good-night,
Gertrude!  [_Exit_.]
LADY CHILTERN.  Good-night, dear!  [_To_ LORD GORING.]  You saw whom Lady
Markby brought here to-night?
LORD GORING.  Yes.  It was an unpleasant surprise.  What did she come
here for?
LADY CHILTERN.  Apparently to try and lure Robert to uphold some
fraudulent scheme in which she is interested.  The Argentine Canal, in
fact.
LORD GORING.  She has mistaken her man, hasn't she?
LADY CHILTERN.  She is incapable of understanding an upright nature like
my husband's!
LORD GORING.  Yes.  I should fancy she came to grief if she tried to get
Robert into her toils.  It is extraordinary what astounding mistakes
clever women make.
LADY CHILTERN.  I don't call women of that kind clever.  I call them
stupid!
LORD GORING.  Same thing often.  Good-night, Lady Chiltern!
LADY CHILTERN.  Good-night!
[_Enter_ SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.]
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  My dear Arthur, you are not going?  Do stop a
little!
LORD GORING.  Afraid I can't, thanks.  I have promised to look in at the
Hartlocks'.  I believe they have got a mauve Hungarian band that plays
mauve Hungarian music.  See you soon.  Good-bye!
[_Exit_]
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  How beautiful you look to-night, Gertrude!
LADY CHILTERN.  Robert, it is not true, is it?  You are not going to lend
your support to this Argentine speculation?  You couldn't!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Starting_.]  Who told you I intended to do so?
LADY CHILTERN.  That woman who has just gone out, Mrs. Cheveley, as she
calls herself now.  She seemed to taunt me with it.  Robert, I know this
woman.  You don't.  We were at school together.  She was untruthful,
dishonest, an evil influence on every one whose trust or friendship she
could win.  I hated, I despised her.  She stole things, she was a thief.
She was sent away for being a thief.  Why do you let her influence you?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Gertrude, what you tell me may be true, but it
happened many years ago.  It is best forgotten!  Mrs. Cheveley may have
changed since then.  No one should be entirely judged by their past.
