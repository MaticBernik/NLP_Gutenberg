VERA. Be it so if you wish it.
PRES. Brothers, is it your will that Prince Paul Maraloffski be
admitted, and take the oath of the Nihilist?
CONSPS. It is! it is!
PRES. (_holding out dagger and a paper_). Prince Paul, the dagger or the
oath?
PRINCE PAUL (_smiles sardonically_). I would sooner annihilate than be
annihilated. (_Takes paper._)
PRES. Remember: [6]Betray us, and as long as the earth holds poison or
steel, as long as men can strike or woman betray, you shall not escape
vengeance.[6] The Nihilists never forget their friends, or forgive their
enemies.
PRINCE PAUL. Really? I did not think you were so civilized.
VERA (_pacing up and down_). Why is he not here? He will not keep the
crown. I know him well.
PRES. Sign. (_PRINCE PAUL signs_.) You said you thought we had no creed.
You were wrong. Read it!
VERA. This is a dangerous thing, President. What can we do with this
man?
PRES. We can use him.
VERA. And afterwards?
PRES. (_shrugging his shoulders_). Strangle him.
PRINCE PAUL (_reading_). "The rights of humanity!" In the old times men
carried out their rights for themselves as they lived, but nowadays
every baby seems born with a social manifesto in its mouth much bigger
than itself.[7] "Nature is not a temple, but a workshop: we demand the
right to labour." Ah, I shall surrender my own rights in that respect.
VERA (_pacing up and down behind_). Oh, will he never come? will he
never come?
PRINCE PAUL. "The family as subversive of true socialistic and communal
unity is to be annihilated." Yes, President, I agree completely with
Article 5. A family is a terrible incumbrance, especially when one is
not married. (_Three knocks at the door._)
VERA. Alexis at last!
_Password._ Vae tyrannis!
_Answer._ Vae victis!
(_Enter MICHAEL STROGANOFF._)
PRES.[8] Michael, the regicide! Brothers, let us do honour to a man who
has killed a king.
[9]VERA (_aside_). Oh, he will come yet.[9]
PRES. Michael, you have saved Russia.
MICH. Ay, Russia was free for a moment [10]when the tyrant fell, but the
sun of liberty has set again like that false dawn which cheats our eyes
in autumn.
PRES. The dread night of tyranny is not yet past for Russia.
MICH. (_clutching his knife_).[10] One more blow, and the end is come
indeed.
VERA (_aside_). One more blow! What does he mean? Oh, impossible! but
why is he not with us? Alexis! Alexis! why are you not here?
PRES. But how did you escape, Michael? They said you had been seized.
MICH. I was dressed in the uniform of the Imperial Guard. The Colonel on
duty was a brother, and gave me the password. I drove through the troops
in safety with it, and, thanks to my good horse, reached the walls
before the gates were closed.
PRES. What a chance his coming out on the balcony was!
MICH. A chance? There is no such thing as chance. It was God's finger
led him there.
