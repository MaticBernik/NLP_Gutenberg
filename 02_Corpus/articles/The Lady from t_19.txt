Arnholm. With whom? What?
Bolette. I mean that he and my stepmother--(breaks off). Father and
mother suffice one another, as you see.
Arnholm. Well, so much the better if you were to get away from here.
Bolette. Yes; but I don't think I've a right to; not to forsake father.
Arnholm. But, dear Bolette, you'll have to do that sometime, anyhow. So
it seems to me the sooner the better.
Bolette. I suppose there is nothing else for it. After all, I must think
of myself, too. I must try and get occupation of some sort. When once
father's gone, I have no one to hold to. But, poor father! I dread
leaving him.
Arnholm. Dread?
Bolette. Yes, for father's sake.
Arnholm. But, good heavens! Your stepmother? She is left to him.
Bolette. That's true. But she's not in the least fit to do all that
mother did so well. There is so much she doesn't see, or that she won't
see, or that she doesn't care about. I don't know which it is.
Arnholm. Um, I think I understand what you mean.
Bolette. Poor father! He is weak in some things. Perhaps you've noticed
that yourself? He hasn't enough occupation, either, to fill up his time.
And then she is so thoroughly incapable of helping him; however, that's
to some extent his own fault.
Arnholm. In what way?
Bolette. Oh! father always likes to see happy faces about him. There
must be sunshine and joy in the house, he says. And so I'm afraid he
often gives her medicine which will do her little good in the long run.
Arnholm. Do you really think that?
Bolette. Yes; I can't get rid of the thought. She is so odd at times.
(Passionately.) But isn't it unjust that I should have to stay at home
here? Really it's not of any earthly use to father. Besides, I have a
duty towards myself, too, I think.
Arnholm. Do you know what, Bolette? We two must talk these matters over
more carefully.
Bolette. Oh! That won't be much use. I suppose I was created to stay
here in the carp pond.
Arnholm. Not a bit of it. It depends entirely upon yourself.
Bolette (quickly). Do you think so?
Arnholm. Yes, believe me, it lies wholly and solely in your own hands.
Bolette. If only that were true! Will you perhaps put in a good word for
me with father?
Arnholm. Certainly. But first of all I must speak frankly and freely
with you yourself, dear.
Bolette (looks out to the left). Hush! don't let them notice anything.
We'll speak of this later.
(ELLIDA enters from the left. She has no hat on, but a large shawl is
thrown over her head and shoulders.)
Ellida (with restless animation). How pleasant it is here! How
delightful it is here!
Arnholm (rising). Have you been for a walk?
Ellida. Yes, a long, long lovely walk up there with Wangel. And now
we're going for a sail.
