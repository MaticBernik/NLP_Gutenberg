    (LADY INGER GYLDENLOVE enters from the hall along with
      OLAF SKAKTAVL.)
  LADY INGER (to NILS LYKKE).  Here is the man you seek.
  NILS LYKKE (aside).  In the name of hell--what means this?
  LADY INGER.  I have told this knight your name and all that you
have imparted to me----
  NILS LYKKE (irresolutely).  Ay?  Have you so?  Well----
  LADY INGER----  And I will not hide from you that his faith in
your help is none of the strongest.
  NILS LYKKE.  Is it not?
  LADY INGER.  Can you marvel at that?  You know, surely, both the
cause he fights for and his bitter fate----
  NILS LYKKE.  This man's----?  Ah--yes, truly----
  OLAF SKAKTAVL (to NILS LYKKE).  But seeing 'tis Peter Kanzler
himself that has appointed us this meeting----
  NILS LYKKE.  Peter Kanzler----?  (Recovers himself quickly.)
Ay, right,--I have a mission from Peter Kanzler----
  OLAF SKAKTAVL.  He must know best whom he can trust.  So why
should I trouble my head with thinking how----
  NILS LYKKE.  Ay, you are right, noble Sir; that were folly indeed.
  OLAF SKAKTAVL.  Rather let us come straight to the matter.
  NILS LYKKE.  Straight to the point; no beating about the bush--
'tis ever my fashion.
  OLAF SKAKTAVL.  Then will you tell me your mission here?
  NILS LYKKE.  Methinks you can partly guess my errand----
  OLAF SKAKTAVL.  Peter Kanzler said something of papers that----
  NILS LYKKE.  Papers?  Ay, true, the papers!
  OLAF SKAKTAVL.  Doubtless you have them with you?
  NILS LYKKE.  Of course; safely bestowed; so safely that I cannot
at once----
    (Appears to search the inner pockets of his doublet; says to
      himself:)
  Who the devil is he?  What pretext shall I make?  I may be on
the brink of great discoveries----
    (Notices that the Servants are laying the table and lighting
      the lamps in the Banquet Hall, and says to OLAF SKAKTAVL:)
  Ah, I see Lady Inger has taken order for the evening meal.  We
could perhaps better talk of our affairs at table.
  OLAF SKAKTAVL.  Good; as you will.
  NILS LYKKE (aside).  Time gained--all gained!
    (To LADY INGER with a show of great friendliness.)
  And meanwhile we might learn what part Lady Inger Gyldenlove
purposes to take in our design?
  LADY INGER.  I?--None.
  NILS LYKKE AND OLAF SKAKTAVL.  None!
  LADY INGER.  Can ye marvel, noble Sirs, that I venture not on
a game, wherein all is staked on one cast?  And that, too, when
none of my allies dare trust me fully.
  NILS LYKKE.  That reproach touches not me.  I trust you blindly;
I pray you be assured of that.
  OLAF SKAKTAVL.  Who should believe in you, if not your countrymen?
  LADY INGER.  Truly,--this confidence rejoices me.
    (Goes to a cupboard in the back wall and fills two goblets
      with wine.)
  NILS LYKKE (aside).  Curse her, will she slip out of the noose?
  LADY INGER (hands a goblet to each).  And since so it is, I
offer you a cup of welcome to Ostrat.  Drink, noble knights!
Pledge me to the last drop!
    (Looks from one to the other after they have drunk, and says
      gravely:)
  But now I must tell you--one goblet held a welcome for my friend;
the other--death for my enemy.
