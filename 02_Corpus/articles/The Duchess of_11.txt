   Do you not know that I am yours for ever,
   Body and soul?
 [_Kisses him_, _and then suddenly catches sight of_ MORANZONE _and leaps
                                  up_.]
   Oh, what is that?  [MORANZONE _disappears_.]
GUIDO
   What, love?
DUCHESS
   Methought I saw a face with eyes of flame
   Look at us through the doorway.
GUIDO
   Nay, twas nothing:
   The passing shadow of the man on guard.
          [_The_ DUCHESS _still stands looking at the window_.]
   Twas nothing, sweet.
DUCHESS
   Ay! what can harm us now,
   Who are in Loves hand?  I do not think Id care
   Though the vile world should with its lackey Slander
   Trample and tread upon my life; why should I?
   They say the common field-flowers of the field
   Have sweeter scent when they are trodden on
   Than when they bloom alone, and that some herbs
   Which have no perfume, on being bruiséd die
   With all Arabia round them; so it is
   With the young lives this dull world seeks to crush,
   It does but bring the sweetness out of them,
   And makes them lovelier often.  And besides,
   While we have love we have the best of life:
   Is it not so?
GUIDO
   Dear, shall we play or sing?
   I think that I could sing now.
DUCHESS
   Do not speak,
   For there are times when all existences
   Seem narrowed to one single ecstasy,
   And Passion sets a seal upon the lips.
GUIDO
   Oh, with mine own lips let me break that seal!
   You love me, Beatrice?
DUCHESS
   Ay! is it not strange
   I should so love mine enemy?
GUIDO
   Who is he?
DUCHESS
   Why, you: that with your shaft did pierce my heart!
   Poor heart, that lived its little lonely life
   Until it met your arrow.
GUIDO
   Ah, dear love,
   I am so wounded by that bolt myself
   That with untended wounds I lie a-dying,
   Unless you cure me, dear Physician.
DUCHESS
   I would not have you cured; for I am sick
   With the same malady.
GUIDO
   Oh, how I love you!
   See, I must steal the cuckoos voice, and tell
   The one tale over.
DUCHESS
   Tell no other tale!
   For, if that is the little cuckoos song,
   The nightingale is hoarse, and the loud lark
   Has lost its music.
GUIDO
   Kiss me, Beatrice!
[_She takes his face in her hands and bends down and kisses him_; _a loud
knocking then comes at the door_, _and_ GUIDO _leaps up_; _enter a
Servant_.]
SERVANT
   A package for you, sir.
GUIDO [_carelessly_]
   Ah! give it to me.
   [_Servant hands package wrapped in vermilion silk_, _and exit_; _as_
   GUIDO _is about to open it the_ DUCHESS _comes up behind_, _and in
   sport takes it from him_.]
DUCHESS [_laughing_]
   Now I will wager it is from some girl
   Who would have you wear her favour; I am so jealous
   I will not give up the least part in you,
   But like a miser keep you to myself,
   And spoil you perhaps in keeping.
GUIDO
   It is nothing.
DUCHESS
   Nay, it is from some girl.
GUIDO
   You know tis not.
