Do not heed my friend, Miss Maylie, said Mr. Brownlow; he does not
mean what he says.
Yes, he does, growled Mr. Grimwig.
No, he does not, said Mr. Brownlow, obviously rising in wrath as he
spoke.
Hell eat his head, if he doesnt, growled Mr. Grimwig.
He would deserve to have it knocked off, if he does, said Mr.
Brownlow.
And hed uncommonly like to see any man offer to do it, responded Mr.
Grimwig, knocking his stick upon the floor.
Having gone thus far, the two old gentlemen severally took snuff, and
afterwards shook hands, according to their invariable custom.
Now, Miss Maylie, said Mr. Brownlow, to return to the subject in
which your humanity is so much interested. Will you let me know what
intelligence you have of this poor child: allowing me to premise that
I exhausted every means in my power of discovering him, and that since
I have been absent from this country, my first impression that he had
imposed upon me, and been persuaded by his former associates to rob me,
has been considerably shaken.
Rose, who had had time to collect her thoughts, at once related in
a few natural words all that had befallen Oliver since he left Mr.
Brownlows house, reserving Nancys information for that gentlemans
private ear, and concluding with the assurance that his only sorrow for
some months past had been the not being able to meet with his former
benefactor and friend.
Thank God! said the old gentleman this is great happiness to me,
great happiness. But you have not told me where he is now, Miss Maylie.
You must pardon my finding fault with you,but why not have brought
him?
He is waiting in a coach at the door, replied Rose.
At this door! cried the old gentleman. With which he hurried out of
the room, down the stairs, up the coach-steps, and into the coach,
without another word.
When the room-door closed behind him, Mr. Grimwig lifted up his head,
and converting one of the hind legs of his chair into a pivot described
three distinct circles with the assistance of his stick and the table:
sitting in it all the time. After performing this evolution, he rose
and limped as fast as he could up and down the room at least a dozen
times, and then stopping suddenly before Rose, kissed her without the
slightest preface.
Hush! he said, as the young lady rose in some alarm at this unusual
proceeding, dont be afraid; Im old enough to be your grandfather.
Youre a sweet girlI like you. Here they are.
In fact, as he threw himself at one dexterous dive into his former
seat, Mr. Brownlow returned accompanied by Oliver, whom Mr. Grimwig
received very graciously; and if the gratification of that moment had
been the only reward for all her anxiety and care in Olivers behalf,
Rose Maylie would have been well repaid.
There is somebody else who should not be forgotten, by the by, said
Mr. Brownlow, ringing the bell. Send Mrs. Bedwin here, if you please.
