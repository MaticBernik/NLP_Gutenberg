    If, in the above example, we were to alter "lit with gas" into
    "paved with gold," we should get the _Imaginary_ Class "towns
    paved with gold."]
A Class, containing only _one_ Member is called an '=Individual=.'
    [For example, the Class "towns having four million inhabitants,"
    which Class contains only _one_ Member, viz. "London."]
                                                                   pg002 1/2
Hence, any single Thing, which we can name so as to distinguish it from
all other Things, may be regarded as a one-Member Class.
    [Thus "London" may be regarded as the one-Member Class, picked
    out from the Class "towns," which has, as its Differentia,
    "having four million inhabitants."]
A Class, containing two or more Members, is sometimes regarded as _one
single Thing_. When so regarded, it may possess an Adjunct which is
_not_ possessed by any Member of it taken separately.
    [Thus, the Class "The soldiers of the Tenth Regiment," when
    regarded as _one single Thing_, may possess the Attribute
    "formed in square," which is _not_ possessed by any Member of it
    taken separately.]
                                                                   pg003
CHAPTER III.
_DIVISION._
Sec. 1.
_Introductory._
'Division' is a Mental Process, in which we think of a certain Class of
Things, and imagine that we have divided it into two or more smaller
Classes.
    [Thus, we might think of the Class "books," and imagine that we
    had divided it into the two smaller Classes "bound books" and
    "unbound books," or into the three Classes, "books priced at
    less than a shilling," "shilling-books," "books priced at more
    than a shilling," or into the twenty-six Classes, "books whose
    names begin with _A_," "books whose names begin with _B_," &c.]
A Class, that has been obtained by a certain Division, is said to be
'codivisional' with every Class obtained by that Division.
    [Thus, the Class "bound books" is codivisional with each of the
    two Classes, "bound books" and "unbound books."
    Similarly, the Battle of Waterloo may be said to have been
    "contemporary" with every event that happened in 1815.]
Hence a Class, obtained by Division, is codivisional with itself.
    [Thus, the Class "bound books" is codivisional with itself.
    Similarly, the Battle of Waterloo may be said to have been
    "contemporary" with itself.]
                                                                   pg003 1/2
Sec. 2.
_Dichotomy._
If we think of a certain Class, and imagine that we have picked out from
it a certain smaller Class, it is evident that the _Remainder_ of the
large Class does _not_ possess the Differentia of that smaller Class.
Hence it may be regarded as _another_ smaller Class, whose Differentia
may be formed, from that of the Class first picked out, by prefixing the
word "not"; and we may imagine that we have _divided_ the Class first
thought of into _two_ smaller Classes, whose Differentiae are
_contradictory_. This kind of Division is called '=Dichotomy='.
    [For example, we may divide "books" into the two Classes whose
    Differentiae are "old" and "not-old."]
In performing this Process, we may sometimes find that the Attributes we
have chosen are used so loosely, in ordinary conversation, that it is
not easy to decide _which_ of the Things belong to the one Class and
_which_ to the other. In such a case, it would be necessary to lay down
some arbitrary _rule_, as to _where_ the one Class should end and the
other begin.
