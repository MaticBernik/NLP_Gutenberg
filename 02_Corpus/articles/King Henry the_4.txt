    [_Crosses L.H._
  Let us to France; like horse-leeches, my boys,
  To suck, to suck, the very blood to suck!
    [_Crosses R.H._
_Boy._ And that is but unwholesome food, they say.
_Pitt._ Touch her soft mouth, and march.
_Bard._ Farewell, hostess.
    [_Kissing her._
_Nym._ I cannot kiss, that is the humour of it; but adieu.
_Pist._ Let housewifery appear: keep close, I thee command.
_Quick._ Farewell; adieu.
    [_Exeunt BARDOLPH, PISTOL, NYM, R.H., and DAME QUICKLY, L.H._
_Boy._ As young as I am, I have observed these three swashers. I am boy
to them all three: but all they three, though they would serve me, could
not be a man to me; for, indeed, three such anticks do not amount to a
man. For Bardolph,--he is white-livered and red-faced; by the means
whereof 'a faces it out, but fights not. For Pistol,--he hath a killing
tongue and a quiet sword; by the means whereof 'a breaks words, and
keeps whole weapons. For Nym,--he hath heard that men of few words are
the best men; and therefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest 'a should
be thought a coward: but his few bad words are match'd with as few good
deeds; for 'a never broke any man's head but his own, and that was
against a post when he was drunk. They will steal any thing, and call
it--purchase. They would have me as familiar with men's pockets as their
gloves or their handkerchiefs: which makes much against my manhood, if I
should take from another's pocket to put into mine; for it is plain
pocketing up of wrongs. I must leave them, and seek some better service:
their villainy goes against my weak stomach, and therefore I must cast
it up.
    [_Distant March heard. Exit BOY, R.H._
END OF FIRST ACT.

    attend, or accompany thee.]
    [Footnote I.18: _----Arthur's bosom,_] Dame Quickly, in her usual
    blundering way, mistakes Arthur for Abraham.]
    [Footnote I.19: _'A made a finer end,_] To make a fine end is not
    an uncommon expression for making a good end. The Hostess means
    that Falstaff died with becoming resignation and patient
    submission to the will of Heaven.]
    [Footnote I.20: _----an it had been any christom child;_] i.e.,
    child that has wore the _chrysom_, or white cloth put on a new
    baptized child.]
    [Footnote I.21: _----turning o' the tide:_] It has been a very old
    opinion, which Mead, _de imperio solis_, quotes, as if he believed
    it, that nobody dies but in the time of ebb: half the deaths in
    London confute the notion; but we find that it was common among
    the women of the poet's time. --JOHNSON.]
    [Footnote I.22: _----I saw him fumble with the sheets,_] Pliny, in
    his chapter on _the signs of death_, makes mention of "_a fumbling
    and pleiting of the bed-clothes._" The same indication of
    approaching death is enumerated by Celsus, Lommius, Hippocrates,
    and Galen.]
    [Footnote I.23: _'A could never abide carnation;_] Mrs. Quickly
    blunders, mistaking the word _incarnate_ for a colour. _In
    questions of Love_, published 1566, we have "_yelowe, pale, redde,
    blue, whyte, gray, and incarnate._"]
