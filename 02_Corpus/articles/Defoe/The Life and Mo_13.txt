_Oct. 1_. That morning, with great comfort, I beheld the ship drove
ashore. Some hopes I had, that when the storm was abated I might be able
to get some food and necessaries out of her, which I conceived were not
damaged, because the ship did stand upright. At this time I lamented the
loss of my companions, and our misfortune in leaving the vessel. When I
perceived the ship as it were lay dry, I waded through the sands, then
swam aboard, the weather being very rainy, and with scarcely any wind.
To the 14th of this month, my time was employed in making voyages, every
tide getting what I could out of the ship. The weather very wet and
uncertain.
_Oct. 20_. My raft and all the goods thereon were overset: yet I
recovered most again at low water.
_Oct. 25_. It blew hard, and rained night and day, when the ship went in
pieces, so that nothing was seen of her but the wreck at low water. This
day I secured my goods from the inclemency of the weather.
_Oct. 26_. I wandered to see where I could find a place convenient for
my abode. I fixed upon a rock in the evening, marked out a half-moon,
intending to erect a wall, fortified with piles, lined within with
pieces of cables, and covered with turf.
_Nov. 1_. I erected my tent under a rock, and took up my lodgings very
contentedly in a hammock that night.
_Nov._ 2. This day I fenced myself in with timber, chests, and boards.
_Nov._ 3. I shot two wild fowl, resembling ducks, which were good to
eat, and in the afternoon made me a table.
_Nov._ 4. I began to live regularly. In the morning I allowed myself two
or three hours to walk out with my gun; I then worked till near eleven
o'clock, and afterwards refreshed myself, with what I had to eat. From
twelve to two I would lie down to sleep. Extremely sultry weather. In
the evening go to work again.
_Nov._ 5. Went out with my gun and dog, shot a wild ca with a soft skin,
but her flesh was good for nothing. The skins of those I killed, I
preserved. In my return, I perceived many wild birds, and was terrified
by some seals which made off to sea.
_Nov._ 6. Completed my table.
_Nov._ 7. Fair weather. I worked till the 12th, but omitted the 11th,
which, according to my calculation, I supposed to be Sunday.
_Nov._ 13. Rain in abundance, which, however, much cooled the air; with
thunder and lightening, caused in me a terrible surprise. The weather
clearing, I secured my powder in separate parcels.
_Nov._ 14--16. I made little boxes for my powder, lodging them in
several places. I also shot a large fowl, which proved excellent meat.
_Nov._ 17. I began to dig in the rock, yet was obliged to desist for
want of a pickax, shovel, and wheel-barrow. Iron crows I caused to
supply the place of the first; but with all my art I could not make a
wheel-barrow.
