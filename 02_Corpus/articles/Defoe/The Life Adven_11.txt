The first piece of news they told us after the short history of their
coming away was, that our companion was on board, but how he got
thither we could not imagine, for he had given us the slip, and we never
imagined he could swim so well as to venture off to the ship, which lay
at so great a distance; nay, we did not so much as know that he could
swim at all, and not thinking anything of what really happened, we
thought he must have wandered into the woods and was devoured, or
was fallen into the hands of the natives, and was murdered; and these
thoughts filled us with fears enough, and of several kinds, about its
being some time or other our lot to fall into their hands also. But
hearing how he had with much difficulty been received on board the ship
again and pardoned, we were much better satisfied than before.
Being now, as I have said, a considerable number of us, and in condition
to defend ourselves, the first thing we did was to give every one his
hand that we would not separate from one another upon any occasion
whatsoever, but that we would live and die together; that we would kill
no food, but that we would distribute it in public; and that we would
be in all things guided by the majority, and not insist upon our own
resolutions in anything if the majority were against it; that we would
appoint a captain among us to be our governor or leader during pleasure;
that while he was in office we would obey him without reserve, on pain
of death; and that every one should take turn, but the captain was not
to act in any particular thing without advice of the rest, and by the
majority.
Having established these rules, we resolved to enter into some measures
for our food, and for conversing with the inhabitants or natives of the
island for our supply. As for food, they were at first very useful to
us, but we soon grew weary of them, being an ignorant, ravenous, brutish
sort of people, even worse than the natives of any other country that we
had seen; and we soon found that the principal part of our subsistence
was to be had by our guns, shooting of deer and other creatures, and
fowls of all other sorts, of which there is abundance.
We found the natives did not disturb or concern themselves much about
us; nor did they inquire, or perhaps know, whether we stayed among them
or not, much less that our ship was gone quite away, and had cast us
off, as was our case; for the next morning, after we had sent back the
long-boat, the ship stood away to the south-east, and in four hours'
time was out of our sight.
The next day two of us went out into the country one way, and two
another, to see what kind of a land we were in; and we soon found the
country was very pleasant and fruitful, and a convenient place enough
to live in; but, as before, inhabited by a parcel of creatures scarce
human, or capable of being made social on any account whatsoever.
