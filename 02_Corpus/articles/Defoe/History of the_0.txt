The like increase of the bills was observed in the parishes of St.
Bride's, adjoining on one side of Holborn Parish, and in the parish of
St. James's, Clerkenwell, adjoining on the other side of Holborn; in
both which parishes the usual numbers that died weekly were from four to
six or eight, whereas at that time they were increased as follows:--
    Dec. 20 to Dec. 27, St. Bride's       0
                        St. James's       8
    Dec. 27 to Jan. 3,  St. Bride's       6
                        St. James's       9
    Jan. 3 to Jan. 10,  St. Bride's      11
                        St. James's       7
    Jan. 10 to Jan. 17, St. Bride's      12
                        St. James's       9
    Jan. 17 to Jan. 24, St. Bride's       9
                        St. James's      15
    Jan. 24 to Jan. 31, St. Bride's       8
                        St. James's      12
    Jan. 31 to Feb. 7,  St. Bride's      13
                        St. James's       5
    Feb. 7 to Feb. 14,  St. Bride's      12
                        St. James's       6
Besides this, it was observed, with great uneasiness by the people, that
the weekly bills in general increased very much during these weeks,
although it was at a time of the year when usually the bills are very
moderate.
The usual number of burials within the bills of mortality for a week was
from about two hundred and forty, or thereabouts, to three hundred. The
last was esteemed a pretty high bill; but after this we found the bills
successively increasing, as follows:--
                          Buried.   Increased.
    Dec. 20 to Dec. 27      291         0
    Dec. 27 to Jan. 3       349        58
    Jan. 3 to Jan. 10       394        45
    Jan. 10 to Jan. 17      415        21
    Jan. 17 to Jan. 24      474        59
This last bill was really frightful, being a higher number than had
been known to have been buried in one week since the preceding
visitation of 1656.
However, all this went off again; and the weather proving cold, and the
frost, which began in December, still continuing very severe, even till
near the end of February, attended with sharp though moderate winds, the
bills decreased again, and the city grew healthy; and everybody began to
look upon the danger as good as over, only that still the burials in St.
Giles's continued high. From the beginning of April, especially, they
stood at twenty-five each week, till the week from the 18th to the 25th,
when there was[13] buried in St. Giles's Parish thirty, whereof two of
the plague, and eight of the spotted fever (which was looked upon as the
same thing); likewise the number that died of the spotted fever in the
whole increased, being eight the week before, and twelve the week above
named.
This alarmed us all again; and terrible apprehensions were among the
people, especially the weather being now changed and growing warm, and
the summer being at hand. However, the next week there seemed to be some
hopes again: the bills were low; the number of the dead in all was but
388; there was none of the plague, and but four of the spotted fever.
