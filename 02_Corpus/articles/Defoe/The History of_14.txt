Nay they go farther, and suggest bold things against the wisdom of
Heaven, in exposing mankind, weak in comparison of the immense extent of
the _Devil_'s power, to so manifest an overthrow, to so unequal a fight,
in which he is sure, if alone in the conflict, to be worsted; to leave
him such a dreadful enemy to engage with, and so ill furnish'd with
weapons to assist him.
These objections I shall give as good an answer to as the case will
admit in this course, but must adjourn them for the present.
That the Devil is not yet a close prisoner, we have evidence enough to
confirm; I will not suggest, that like our _Newgate_ Thieves, (to bring
little Devils and great Devils together) he is let out by connivance,
and has some little latitudes and advantages for mischief, by that
means; returning at certain seasons to his confinement again. This
might hold, were it not, that the comparison must suggest, that the
power which has cast him down could be deluded, and the under-keepers or
jaylors, under whose charge he was in custody, could wink at his
excursions, and the Lord of the place know nothing of the matter. But
this wants farther explanation.
CHAP. III.
_Of the original of the_ DEVIL, _who he is, and what he was before his
     expulsion out of Heaven, and in what state he was from that time
     to the creation of Man._
To come to a regular enquiry into Satan's affairs, 'tis needful we
should go back to his original, as far as history and the opinion of the
learned World will give us leave.
It is agreed by all Writers, as well sacred as prophane, that this
creature we now call a Devil, was originally an Angel of light, a
glorious Seraph; perhaps the choicest of all the glorious Seraphs. See
how _Milton_ describes his original glory:
  _Satan_, so call him now, his former name
  Is heard no more in Heaven: He of the first,
  If not _the first Archangel_; great in power,
  In favour and preeminence.
  _lib._ v. _fol._ 140.
And again the same author, and upon the same subject:
  ------Brighter once amidst the host
  Of Angels, than that star the stars among.
  _lib._ vii. _fol._ 189.
The glorious figure which Satan is supposed to make among the _Thrones_
and _Dominions_ in Heaven is such, as we might suppose the highest Angel
in that exalted train could make; and some think, _as above_, that he
was the chief of the Arch-angels.
Hence that notion, (and not ill founded) _namely_, that the first cause
of his disgrace, and on which ensued his rebellion, was occasioned upon
God's proclaiming his SON Generalissimo, and with himself supreme ruler
in heaven; giving the dominion of all his works of creation, as well
already finish'd, as not then begun, to him; which post of honour (say
they) _Satan_ expected to be conferr'd on himself, as next in honour,
majesty and power to God the Supreme.
