And yet, before I have done, I shall make it very plain, that however my
information may be secret and difficult, that yet I came very honestly
by it, and shall make a very good use of it; for 'tis a great mistake in
those who think that an acquaintance with the affairs of _the Devil_ may
not be made very useful to us all: They that know no evil can know no
good; and, as the learned tell us, that a stone taken out of the head of
a Toad is a good antidote against poison; so a competent knowledge of
_the Devil_, and all his ways, may be the best help to make us defie
_the Devil_ and all his _works_.
CHAP. II.
_Of the word_ DEVIL, _as it is a proper name to the Devil, and any or all
     his host, Angels,_ &c.
It is a question, not yet determined by the learned, whether the word
_Devil_ be a _singular_, that is to say, the _name_ of a person standing
by himself, or a _noun of multitude_; if it be a singular, and so must
be used personally only as _a proper name_, it consequently implies one
imperial _Devil_, Monarch or King of the whole clan of Hell; justly
distinguish'd by the term THE DEVIL, or as the _Scots_ call him, _the
muckle horn'd Dee'l_, or as others in a wilder dialect, _the Devil of
Hell_, that is to say, the _Devil_ of a _Devil_; or (better still) as
the Scripture expresses it, by way of emphasis, the _great red Dragon_,
the _Devil_ and _Satan_.
But if we take this word to be, as above, _a noun of multitude_, and so
to be used _ambo-dexter_, as occasion presents, singular or plural; then
_the Devil_ signifies _Satan_ by himself, or _Satan with all his
Legions_ at his heels, as you please, more or less; and this way of
understanding the word, as it may be very convenient for my purpose, in
the account I am now to give of the infernal Powers, so it is not
altogether improper in the nature of the thing: It is thus express'd in
Scripture, where the person possess'd _Matt._ iv. 24. is first said to
be possess'd of _the Devil_ (singular) and our Saviour asks him, as
speaking to a single person, _what is thy name?_ and is answer'd in the
plural and singular together, my name is LEGION, for _we are many_.
Nor will it be any wrong to _the Devil_, supposing him a single person,
seeing entitling him to the conduct of all his inferior Agents, is what
he will take rather for an addition to his infernal glory, than a
diminution or lessening of him in the extent of his Fame.
Having thus articl'd with the _Devil_ for liberty of speech, I shall
talk of him sometimes in the singular, as a person, and sometimes in the
plural, as an host of _Devils_ or of infernal Spirits, just as occasion
requires, and as the history of his affairs makes necessary.
