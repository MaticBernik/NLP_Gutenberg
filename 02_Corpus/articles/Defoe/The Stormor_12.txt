Others thought they heard it thunder. 'Tis confess'd, the Wind by its
unusual Violence made such a noise in the Air as had a resemblance to
Thunder; and 'twas observ'd, the roaring had a Voice as much louder than
usual, as the Fury of the Wind was greater than was ever known: the
Noise had also something in it more formidable; it sounded aloft, and
roar'd not very much unlike remote Thunder.
And yet tho' I cannot remember to have heard it thunder, or that I saw
any Lightning, or heard of any that did in or near _London_; yet in the
Counties the Air was seen full of Meteors and vaporous Fires: and in
some places both Thundrings and unusual Flashes of Lightning, to the
great terror of the Inhabitants.
And yet I cannot but observe here, how fearless such People as are
addicted to Wickedness, are both of God's Judgments and uncommon
Prodigies; which is visible in this Particular, That a Gang of hardned
Rogues assaulted a Family at _Poplar_, in the very Height of the Storm,
broke into the House, and robb'd them: it is observable, that the People
cryed Thieves, and after that cryed Fire, in hopes to raise the
Neighbourhood, and to get some Assistance; but such is the Power of
Self-Preservation, and such was the Fear, the Minds of the People were
possess'd with, that no Body would venture out to the Assistance of the
distressed Family, who were rifled and plundered in the middle of all
the Extremity of the Tempest.
It would admit of a large Comment here, and perhaps not very
unprofitable, to examine from what sad Defect in Principle it must be
that Men can be so destitute of all manner of Regard to invisible and
superiour Power, to be acting one of the vilest Parts of a Villain,
while infinite Power was threatning the whole World with Disolation, and
Multitudes of People expected the Last Day was at Hand.
Several Women in the City of _London_ who were in Travail, or who fell
into Travail by the Fright of the Storm, were oblig'd to run the risque
of being delivered with such Help as they had; and Midwives found their
own Lives in such Danger, that few of them thought themselves oblig'd to
shew any Concern for the Lives of others.
Fire was the only Mischief that did not happen to make the Night
compleatly dreadful; and yet that was not so every where, for in
_Norfolk_ the Town of ---- was almost ruin'd by a furious Fire, which
burnt with such Vehemence, and was so fann'd by the Tempest, that the
Inhabitants had no Power to concern themselves in the extinguishing it;
the Wind blew the Flames, together with the Ruines, so about, that there
was no standing near it; for if the People came to Windward they were in
Danger to be blown into the Flames; and if to Leeward the Flames were so
blown up in their Faces, they could not bear to come near it.
