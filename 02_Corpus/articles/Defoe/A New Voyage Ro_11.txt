Captain Merlotte, who spoke Dutch, began, but the Dutch captain
interrupted him, and asked if the English captain, meaning me, spoke
Dutch; he said no; upon which he asked Captain Merlotte if he spoke
English, and he said yes, upon which he let me know that he understood
English, and desired I would speak to him in English.
I was heartily glad of this, and began immediately with the story, for
we had time little enough, I told him that he was particularly happy in
having it in his power to say he could put his life in the hand of any
man, the meanest in his ship; that my men were unhappily the reverse of
his; and, then beginning at the first of the story, I gave him a full
account of the whole, as related above.
He was extremely affected with it, and asked me what he could do to
serve me, and assured me that he would not only do what in him lay, but
would engage all the ships in the road to do the like, and the governor
also on shore. I thanked him very sincerely, and told him what at
present was the circumstance I thought lay before me, was this, viz.,
that the chief conspirators would be on shore on the morrow, with one,
or perhaps two, of our boats, to fetch water and get some fresh
provisions, and I should be very glad to have them seized upon by
surprise, when they were on shore, and that then I thought I could
master the rest on board well enough.
Leave that to me, says he, I will give the governor notice this evening,
and as soon as they come on shore they shall be all seized; But, says
he, if you think they may incline to make any resistance, I will write a
line to the governor, and give it you now; then, when your men go on
shore, order two of the principal rogues to go and wait on the governor
with the letter from you, and when he receives it, he shall secure them
there; so they will be divided, and taken with the more ease.
In the mean time, added he, while this is doing on shore, I will come on
board your ship, with my long boat and pinnace, and as many men as you
please, to repay you the compliment of this visit, and assist you in
reducing the rest.
This was so kind, and so completely what I desired, that I could have
asked nothing more; and I accepted his visit in his barge, which I
thought would be enough, but was afraid that, if more came, our men
might be alarmed, and take arms before I was ready; so we agreed upon
that, and, if I desired more help, I should hang out a signal, viz., a
red ancient, on the mizen top.
All things being thus consulted, I returned on board, pretending to our
men that I had spent so much time on board the Dutch ship, that I could
not go on shore; and indeed some of my men were so drunk, that they
could scarce sit to their oars; and the coxswain was so very far gone,
that I took occasion to ask publicly, to leave him on board till the
next day, giving the Dutch captain also a hint that he was in the
conspiracy, and I should be glad to leave him on that account.
