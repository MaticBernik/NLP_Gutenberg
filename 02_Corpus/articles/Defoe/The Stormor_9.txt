    _October_ and _November_ last, although not remarkably wet, yet have
    been open warm Months for the most part. My Thermometer (whose
    freezing Point is about 84) hath been very seldom below 100 all this
    Winter, and especially in _November_.
    Thus I have laid before you as short Account as I could of the
    preceding Disposition of the Year, particularly as to wet and
    warmth, because I am of opinion that these had a great Influence in
    the late Storm; not only in causing a Repletion of Vapours in the
    Atmosphere, but also in raising such Nitro-sulphureous or other
    heterogeneous matter, which when mix'd together might make a sort of
    Explosion (like fired Gun-powder) in the Atmosphere. And from this
    Explosion I judge those Corruscations or Flashes in the Storm to
    have proceeded, which most People as well as my self observed, and
    which some took for Lightning. But these things I leave to better
    Judgments, such as that very ingenious Member of our Society, who
    hath undertaken the Province of the late Tempest; to whom, if you
    please, you may impart these Papers; Mr. _Halley_ you know I mean.
    From Preliminaries it is time to proceed nearer to the Tempest it
    self. And the foregoing Day, _viz. Thursday, Nov._ 25. I think
    deserveth regard. In the Morning of that day was a little Rain, the
    Winds high in the Afternoon: S.b.E. and S. In the Evening there was
    Lightning; and between 9 and 10 of the Clock at Night, a violent,
    but short Storm of Wind, and much Rain at _Upminster_; and of Hail
    in some other Places, which did some Damage: There fell in that
    Storm 1,65 _l._ of Rain. The next Morning, which was _Friday,
    Novem._ 26. the Wind was S.S.W. and high all Day, and so continued
    till I was in Bed and asleep. About 12 that Night, the Storm
    awaken'd me, which gradually encreas'd till near 3 that Morning; and
    from thence till near 7 it continued in the greatest excess: and
    then began slowly to abate, and the _Mercury_ to rise swiftly. The
    Barometer I found at 12 h. 1/2 P.M. at 28,72, where it continued till
    about 6 the next Morning, or 61/4, and then hastily rose; so that it
    was gotten to 82 about 8 of the Clock, as in the Table.
    How the Wind sat during the late Storm I cannot positively say, it
    being excessively dark all the while, and my Vane blown down also,
    when I could have seen: But by Information from Millers, and others
    that were forc'd to venture abroad; and by my own guess, I imagin it
    to have blown about S.W. by S. or nearer to the S. in the
    beginning, and to veer about towards the West towards the End of the
    Storm, as far as W.S.W.
    The degrees of the Wind's Strength being not measurable (that I know
    of, though talk'd of) but by guess, I thus determine, with respect
    to other Storms. On _Feb._ 7. 1698/9. was a terrible Storm that did
    much damage. This I number 10 degrees; the Wind then W.N.W. _vid.
    Ph. Tr. No._ 262. Another remarkable Storm was _Feb._ 3. 1701/2. at
    which time was the greatest descent of the [m] ever known: This I
    number 9 degrees. But this last of _November_, I number at least 15
    degrees.
