An honest Yeoman likewise of _Scaldwel_ in _Northamptonshire_, being
upon a Ladder to save his Hovel, was blown off, and fell upon a Plough,
died outright, and never spoke Word more.
Also at _Tewksbury_ in _Gloucestershire_, a Man was blown from an House,
and broken to Pieces.
At _Elsbury_ likewise in the same County, a Woman was killed by the Fall
of Tiles or Bricks from an House.
And not far from the same Place, a Girl was killed by the Fall of a
Tree.
Near _Northampton_, a Man was killed by the Fall of a great Barn.
Near _Colchester_, a Young-man was killed by the Fall of a Wind-mill.
Not far from _Ipswich_ in _Suffolk_, a Man was killed by the Fall of a
Barn.
And about two Miles from the said Town of _Ipswich_, a Man was killed by
the Fall of a Tree.
At _Langton_, or near to it, in the County of _Leicester_, one Mr.
_Roberts_ had a Wind-mill blown down, in which were three Men; and by
the Fall of it, one of them was killed outright, a second had his Back
broken, and the other had his Arm or Leg struck off; and both of them
(according to our best Information) are since dead.
Several other Instances there are of the like Nature; but it would be
too tedious to mention them: Let these therefore suffice to stir us up
to Repentance, _lest we likewise perish_.
There are also many Effects of this Storm which are of another Nature,
whereof we shall give this following brief Account.
The Wind hath very much prejudiced many Churches in several Parts of the
Nation.
At _Tewksbury_ in _Gloucestershire_, it blew down a very fair Window
belonging to the Church there, both the Glass, and the Stone-work also;
the Doors likewise of that Church were blown open, much of the Lead torn
up, and some Part of a fair Pinnacle thrown down.
Also at _Red-Marly_ and _Newin_, not far from _Tewksbury_, their
Churches are extreamly broken and shatter'd, if not a considerable part
of them blown down. The like was done to most, if not all the Publick
Meeting-places at _Gloucester_ City. And it is reported, that some
Hundreds of Pounds will not suffice to repair the Damage done to the
Cathedral at _Worcester_, especially in that Part that is over the
Quire.
The like Fate happen'd to many more of them, as _Hereford_, and
_Leighton Beau-desart_ in _Bedfordshire_, and _Eaton-Soken_ in the same
County; where they had newly erected a very fair Cross of Stone, which
the Wind blew down: and, as some of the Inhabitants did observe, that
was the first Damage which that Town sustained by the Storm, though
afterwards in other respects also they were in the same Condition with
their Neighbours. The Steeples also, and other Parts of the Churches of
_Shenley_, _Waddon_, and _Woolston_ in the County of _Bucks_, have been
very much rent and torn by the Wind. The Spire of _Finchinfield_ Steeple
in the County of _Essex_, was blown down, and it brake through the Body
of the Church, and spoil'd many of the Pews; some Hundreds of Pounds
will not repair that Loss. But that which is most remarkable of this
kind, is, the Fall of that most famous Spire, or Pinnacle of the
Tower-Church in _Ipswich_: it was blown down upon the Body of the
Church, and fell reversed, the sharp End of the Shaft striking through
the Leads on the South-side of the Church, carried much of the
Timber-work down before it into the Alley just behind the Pulpit, and
took off one Side of the Sounding-board over the Pulpit: it shattered
many Pews: The Weather-Cock, and the Iron upon which it stood, broke off
as it fell; but the narrowest Part of the Wood-work, upon which the Fane
stood, fell into the Alley, broke quite through a Grave-stone, and ran
shoring under two Coffins that had been placed there one on another;
that Part of the Spire which was pluck'd up was about three Yards deep
in the Earth, and it is believed some Part of it is yet behind in the
Ground: some Hundreds of Pounds will not make good the Detriment done to
the Church by the Fall of this Pinnacle.
