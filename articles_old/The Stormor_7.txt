And in more modern times we have a famous Instance in the _Spanish
Armada_; which, after it was rather frighted than damag'd by Sir
_Francis Drake_'s Machines, not then known by the Name of Fireships,
were scatter'd by a terrible Storm, and lost upon every Shore.
The Case is plain, 'Twas all owing to the Accident of Navigation: They
had, no doubt, a hard Gale of Wind, and perhaps a Storm; but they were
also on an Enemy's Coast, their Pilots out of their Knowledge, no
Harbour to run into, and an Enemy a-stern, that when once they
separated, Fear drove them from one Danger to another, and away they
went to the Northward, where they had nothing but God's Mercy, and the
Winds and Seas to help them. In all those Storms and Distresses which
ruin'd that Fleet, we do not find an Account of the Loss of one Ship,
either of the _English_ or _Dutch_; the Queen's Fleet rode it out in the
_Downs_, which all Men know is none of the best Roads in the World; and
the _Dutch_ rode among the Flats of the _Flemish_ Coast, while the vast
Galleons, not so well fitted for the Weather, were forc'd to keep the
Sea, and were driven to and fro till they had got out of their
Knowledge; and like Men desperate, embrac'd every Danger they came near.
This long Digression I could not but think needful, in order to clear up
the Case, having never met with any thing on this Head before: At the
same time 'tis allow'd, and Histories are full of the Particulars, that
we have often very high Winds, and sometimes violent Tempests in these
Northen Parts of the World; but I am still of opinion, such a Tempest
never happen'd before as that which is the Subject of these Sheets: and
I refer the Reader to the Particulars.
CHAPTER III
_Of the Storm in General_
Before we come to examine the Damage suffer'd by this terrible Night,
and give a particular Relation of its dismal Effects; 'tis necessary to
give a summary Account of the thing it self, with all its affrightning
Circumstances.
It had blown exceeding hard, as I have already observ'd, for about
fourteen Days past; and that so hard, that we thought it terrible
Weather: Several Stacks of Chimnies were blown down, and several Ships
were lost, and the Tiles in many Places were blown off from the Houses;
and the nearer it came to the fatal 26_th_ of _November_, the
Tempestuousness of the Weather encreas'd.
On the _Wednesday_ Morning before, being the 24_th_ of _November_, it
was fair Weather, and blew hard; but not so as to give any
Apprehensions, till about 4 a Clock in the Afternoon the Wind encreased,
and with Squauls of Rain and terrible Gusts blew very furiously.
The Collector of these Sheets narrowly escap'd the Mischief of a Part of
a House, which fell on the Evening of that Day by the Violence of the
Wind; and abundance of Tiles were blown off the Houses that Night: the
Wind continued with unusual Violence all the next Day and Night; and had
not the Great Storm follow'd so soon, this had pass'd for a great Wind.
