She goes off with her hands on her waist, skipping on one foot.
The slaves file off before Saint Antony's face, together with the
horses, the dromedaries, the elephant, the attendants, the mules, once
more covered with their loads, the negro boys, the ape, and the
green-clad couriers holding their broken lilies in their hands--and the
Queen of Sheba departs, with a spasmodic utterance which might be either
a sob or a chuckle.

CHAPTER III.
THE DISCIPLE, HILARION.
When she has disappeared, Antony perceives a child on the threshold of
his cell.
"It is one of the Queen's servants," he thinks.
This child is small, like a dwarf, and yet thickset, like one of the
Cabiri, distorted, and with a miserable aspect. White hair covers his
prodigiously large head, and he shivers under a sorry tunic, while he
grasps in his hand a roll of papyrus. The light of the moon, across
which a cloud is passing, falls upon him.
Antony observes him from a distance, and is afraid of him.
"Who are you?"
The child replies:
"Your former disciple, Hilarion."
_Antony_--"You lie! Hilarion has been living for many years in
Palestine."
_Hilarion_--"I have returned from it! It is I, in good sooth!"
_Antony_, draws closer and inspects him--"Why, his figure was bright as
the dawn, open, joyous. This one is quite sombre, and has an aged
look."
_Hilarion_--"I am worn out with constant toiling."
_Antony_--"The voice, too, is different. It has a tone that chills you."
_Hilarion_--"That is because I nourish myself on bitter fare."
_Antony_--"And those white locks?"
_Hilarion_--"I have had so many griefs."
_Antony_, aside--"Can it be possible? ..."
_Hilarion_--"I was not so far away as you imagined. The hermit, Paul,
paid you a visit this year during the month of Schebar. It is just
twenty days since the nomads brought you bread. You told a sailor the
day before yesterday to send you three bodkins."
_Antony_--"He knows everything!"
_Hilarion_--"Learn, too, that I have never left you. But you spend long
intervals without perceiving me."
_Antony_--"How is that? No doubt my head is troubled! To-night
especially ..."
_Hilarion_--"All the deadly sins have arrived. But their miserable
snares are of no avail against a saint like you!"
_Antony_--"Oh! no! no! Every minute I give way! Would that I were one of
those whose souls are always intrepid and their minds firm--like the
great Athanasius, for example!"
_Hilarion_--"He was unlawfully ordained by seven bishops!"
_Antony_--"What does it matter? If his virtue ..."
_Hilarion_--"Come, now! A haughty, cruel man, always mixed up in
intrigues, and finally exiled for being a monopolist."
_Antony_--"Calumny!"
_Hilarion_--"You will not deny that he tried to corrupt Eustatius, the
treasurer of the bounties?"
_Antony_--"So it is stated, and I admit it."
_Hilarion_--"He burned, for revenge, the house of Arsenius."
_Antony_--"Alas!"
_Hilarion_--"At the Council of Nicaea, he said, speaking of Jesus, 'The
man of the Lord.'"
_Antony_--"Ah! that is a blasphemy!"
_Hilarion_--"So limited is he, too, that he acknowledges he knows
nothing as to the nature of the Word."
