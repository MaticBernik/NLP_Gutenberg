What, he repeated presently, would Mr. Bounderby say?  All the way to
Stone Lodge, as with grave indignation he led the two delinquents home,
he repeated at intervals What would Mr. Bounderby say?as if Mr.
Bounderby had been Mrs. Grundy.
CHAPTER IV
MR. BOUNDERBY
NOT being Mrs. Grundy, who _was_ Mr. Bounderby?
Why, Mr. Bounderby was as near being Mr. Gradgrinds bosom friend, as a
man perfectly devoid of sentiment can approach that spiritual
relationship towards another man perfectly devoid of sentiment.  So near
was Mr. Bounderbyor, if the reader should prefer it, so far off.
He was a rich man: banker, merchant, manufacturer, and what not.  A big,
loud man, with a stare, and a metallic laugh.  A man made out of a coarse
material, which seemed to have been stretched to make so much of him.  A
man with a great puffed head and forehead, swelled veins in his temples,
and such a strained skin to his face that it seemed to hold his eyes
open, and lift his eyebrows up.  A man with a pervading appearance on him
of being inflated like a balloon, and ready to start.  A man who could
never sufficiently vaunt himself a self-made man.  A man who was always
proclaiming, through that brassy speaking-trumpet of a voice of his, his
old ignorance and his old poverty.  A man who was the Bully of humility.
A year or two younger than his eminently practical friend, Mr. Bounderby
looked older; his seven or eight and forty might have had the seven or
eight added to it again, without surprising anybody.  He had not much
hair.  One might have fancied he had talked it off; and that what was
left, all standing up in disorder, was in that condition from being
constantly blown about by his windy boastfulness.
In the formal drawing-room of Stone Lodge, standing on the hearthrug,
warming himself before the fire, Mr. Bounderby delivered some
observations to Mrs. Gradgrind on the circumstance of its being his
birthday.  He stood before the fire, partly because it was a cool spring
afternoon, though the sun shone; partly because the shade of Stone Lodge
was always haunted by the ghost of damp mortar; partly because he thus
took up a commanding position, from which to subdue Mrs. Gradgrind.
I hadnt a shoe to my foot.  As to a stocking, I didnt know such a
thing by name.  I passed the day in a ditch, and the night in a pigsty.
Thats the way I spent my tenth birthday.  Not that a ditch was new to
me, for I was born in a ditch.
Mrs. Gradgrind, a little, thin, white, pink-eyed bundle of shawls, of
surpassing feebleness, mental and bodily; who was always taking physic
without any effect, and who, whenever she showed a symptom of coming to
life, was invariably stunned by some weighty piece of fact tumbling on
her; Mrs. Gradgrind hoped it was a dry ditch?
No!  As wet as a sop.  A foot of water in it, said Mr. Bounderby.
