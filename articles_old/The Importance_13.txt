Chasuble.  Perhaps she followed us to the schools.
[Enter Jack slowly from the back of the garden.  He is dressed in the
deepest mourning, with crape hatband and black gloves.]
Miss Prism.  Mr. Worthing!
Chasuble.  Mr. Worthing?
Miss Prism.  This is indeed a surprise.  We did not look for you till
Monday afternoon.
Jack.  [Shakes Miss Prism's hand in a tragic manner.]  I have returned
sooner than I expected.  Dr. Chasuble, I hope you are well?
Chasuble.  Dear Mr. Worthing, I trust this garb of woe does not betoken
some terrible calamity?
Jack.  My brother.
Miss Prism.  More shameful debts and extravagance?
Chasuble.  Still leading his life of pleasure?
Jack.  [Shaking his head.]  Dead!
Chasuble.  Your brother Ernest dead?
Jack.  Quite dead.
Miss Prism.  What a lesson for him!  I trust he will profit by it.
Chasuble.  Mr. Worthing, I offer you my sincere condolence.  You have at
least the consolation of knowing that you were always the most generous
and forgiving of brothers.
Jack.  Poor Ernest!  He had many faults, but it is a sad, sad blow.
Chasuble.  Very sad indeed.  Were you with him at the end?
Jack.  No.  He died abroad; in Paris, in fact.  I had a telegram last
night from the manager of the Grand Hotel.
Chasuble.  Was the cause of death mentioned?
Jack.  A severe chill, it seems.
Miss Prism.  As a man sows, so shall he reap.
Chasuble.  [Raising his hand.]  Charity, dear Miss Prism, charity!  None
of us are perfect.  I myself am peculiarly susceptible to draughts.  Will
the interment take place here?
Jack.  No.  He seems to have expressed a desire to be buried in Paris.
Chasuble.  In Paris!  [Shakes his head.]  I fear that hardly points to
any very serious state of mind at the last.  You would no doubt wish me
to make some slight allusion to this tragic domestic affliction next
Sunday.  [Jack presses his hand convulsively.]  My sermon on the meaning
of the manna in the wilderness can be adapted to almost any occasion,
joyful, or, as in the present case, distressing.  [All sigh.]  I have
preached it at harvest celebrations, christenings, confirmations, on days
of humiliation and festal days.  The last time I delivered it was in the
Cathedral, as a charity sermon on behalf of the Society for the
Prevention of Discontent among the Upper Orders.  The Bishop, who was
present, was much struck by some of the analogies I drew.
Jack.  Ah! that reminds me, you mentioned christenings I think, Dr.
Chasuble?  I suppose you know how to christen all right?  [Dr. Chasuble
looks astounded.]  I mean, of course, you are continually christening,
aren't you?
Miss Prism.  It is, I regret to say, one of the Rector's most constant
duties in this parish.  I have often spoken to the poorer classes on the
subject.  But they don't seem to know what thrift is.
Chasuble.  But is there any particular infant in whom you are interested,
Mr. Worthing?  Your brother was, I believe, unmarried, was he not?
