<U+202D>  THE THIRTEENTH BOOK OF HOMERS ODYSSEYS
<U+202D>  THE ARGUMENT
<U+202D>  Ulysses (shippd, but in the even,
<U+202D>  With all the presents he was given,
<U+202D>  And sleeping then) is set next morn
<U+202D>  In full scope of his wishd return,
<U+202D>  And treads unknown his country-shore,
<U+202D>  Whose search so many winters wore.
<U+202D>  The ship (returning, and arrivd
<U+202D>  Against the city) is deprivd
<U+202D>  Of form, and, all her motion gone,
<U+202D>  Transformd by Neptune to a stone.
<U+202D>     Ulysses (let to know the strand
<U+202D>  Where the Phaacians made him land)
<U+202D>  Consults with Pallas, for the life
<U+202D>  Of evry wooer of his wife.
<U+202D>  His gifts she hides within a cave,
<U+202D>  And him into a man more grave,
<U+202D>  All hid in wrinkles, crookéd, gray,
<U+202D>  Transformd; who so goes on his way.
<U+202D>
<U+202D>  ANOTHER ARGUMENT
<U+202D>  _<U+039D><U+03C5><U+0311>._
<U+202D>     Phaacia
<U+202D>        Ulysses leaves;
<U+202D>     Whom Ithaca,
<U+202D>        Unwares, receives.
<U+202D>  He said; and silence all their tongues containd,
<U+202D>  In admiration, when with pleasure chaind
<U+202D>  Their ears had long been to him.  At last brake
<U+202D>  Alcinous silence, and in this sort spake
<U+202D>  To th Ithacensian, Laertes son:
<U+202D>  O Ithacus!  However over-run
<U+202D>  With former suffrings in your way for home,
<U+202D>  Since twas, at last, your happy fate to come
<U+202D>  To my high-roofd and brass-foundationd house,
<U+202D>  I hope, such speed and pass auspicious
<U+202D>  Our loves shall yield you, that you shall no more
<U+202D>  Wander, nor suffer, homewards, as before.
<U+202D>     You then, whoever that are ever gracd
<U+202D>  With all choice of authorizd powr to taste
<U+202D>  Such wine with me as warms the sacred rage,
<U+202D>  And is an honorary givn to age,  [1]
<U+202D>  With which ye likewise hear divinely sing,
<U+202D>  In honours praise, the poet of the king,
<U+202D>  I move, by way of my command, to this:
<U+202D>  That where in an elaborate chest there lies
<U+202D>  A present for our guest, attires of price,
<U+202D>  And gold engravn with infinite device,
<U+202D>  I wish that each of us should add beside
<U+202D>  A tripod, and a caldron, amplified
<U+202D>  With size, and metal of most rate, and great;
<U+202D>  For we, in council of taxation met,
<U+202D>  Will from our subjects gain their worth again;
<U+202D>  Since tis unequal one man should sustain
<U+202D>  A charge so weighty, being the grace of all,
<U+202D>  Which borne by many is a weight but small.
<U+202D>     Thus spake Alcinous, and pleasd the rest;
<U+202D>  When each man closd with home and sleep his feast.
<U+202D>  But when the colour-giving light arose,
<U+202D>  All to the ship did all their speeds dispose,  [2]
<U+202D>  And wealth, that honest men makes, brought with them.  [3]
<U+202D>  All which evn he that wore the diadem
<U+202D>  Stowd in the ship himself, beneath the seats
<U+202D>  The rowers sat in, stooping, lest their lets
<U+202D>  In any of their labours he might prove.
<U+202D>  Then home he turnd, and after him did move
<U+202D>  The whole assembly to expected feast.
<U+202D>  Among whom he a sacrifice addrest,
<U+202D>  And slew an ox, to weather-wielding Jove,
<U+202D>  Beneath whose empire all things are, and move.
<U+202D>     The thighs then roasting, they made glorious cheer
<U+202D>  Delighted highly; and amongst them there
<U+202D>  The honourd-of-the-people usd his voice,
<U+202D>  Divine Demodocus.  Yet, through this choice
<U+202D>  Of cheer and music, had Ulysses still
<U+202D>  An eye directed to the Eastern hill,
<U+202D>  To see Him rising that illustrates all;
<U+202D>  For now into his mind a fire did fall
<U+202D>  Of thirst for home.  And as in hungry vow
<U+202D>  To needful food a man at fixéd plow
<U+202D>  (To whom the black ox all day long hath turnd
<U+202D>  The stubborn fallows up, his stomach burnd
<U+202D>  With empty heat and appetite to food,
<U+202D>  His knees afflicted with his spirit-spent blood)
<U+202D>  At length the long-expected sunset sees,
<U+202D>  That he may sit to food, and rest his knees;
<U+202D>  So to Ulysses set the friendly light
<U+202D>  The sun afforded, with as wishd a sight.
<U+202D>  Who straight bespake that oar-affecting State,
<U+202D>  But did in chief his speech appropriate
<U+202D>  To him by name, that with their rule was crownd.
<U+202D>     Alcinous, of all men most renownd,
<U+202D>  Dismiss me with as safe pass as you vow
<U+202D>  (Your offring past) and may the Gods to you
<U+202D>  In all contentment use as full a hand;
<U+202D>  For now my landing here and stay shall stand
<U+202D>  In all perfection with my hearts desire,
<U+202D>  Both my so safe deduction to aspire,
<U+202D>  And loving gifts; which may the Gods to me
<U+202D>  As blest in use make as your acts are free,
<U+202D>  Evn to the finding firm in love, and life,
<U+202D>  With all desird event, my friends, and wife.
<U+202D>  When, as myself shall live delighted there,
<U+202D>  May you with your wives rest as happy here,
<U+202D>  Your sons and daughters, in particular state,
<U+202D>  With evry virtue renderd consummate;
<U+202D>  And, in your genral empire, may ill never
<U+202D>  Approach your land, but good your good quit ever.
<U+202D>     This all applauded, and all jointly cried:
<U+202D>  Dismiss the stranger!  He hath dignified
<U+202D>  With fit speech his dismission.  Then the king
<U+202D>  Thus chargd the herald:  Fill for offering
<U+202D>  A bowl of wine; which through the whole large house
<U+202D>  Dispose to all men, that, propitious
<U+202D>  Our father Jove made with our prayrs, we may
<U+202D>  Give home our guest in full and wishéd way.
<U+202D>     This said, Pontonous commixd a bowl
<U+202D>  Of such sweet wine as did delight the soul.
<U+202D>  Which making sacred to the blessed Gods,
<U+202D>  That hold in broad heavn their supreme abodes,
<U+202D>  God-like Ulysses from his chair arose,
<U+202D>  And in the hands of th empress did impose
<U+202D>  The all-round cup; to whom, fair spoke, he said:
<U+202D>    Rejoice, O queen, and be your joys repaid
<U+202D>  By heavn, for me, till age and death succeed;
<U+202D>  Both which inflict their most unwelcome need
<U+202D>  On men and dames alike.  And, first, for me,
<U+202D>  I must from hence, to both: Live you here free,
<U+202D>  And ever may all living blessings spring,
<U+202D>  Your joy in children, subjects, and your king.
<U+202D>     This said, divine Ulysses took his way;
<U+202D>  Before whom the unalterable sway
<U+202D>  Of king Alcinous virtue did command
<U+202D>  A heralds fit attendance to the strand,
<U+202D>  And ship appointed.  With him likewise went
<U+202D>  Handmaids, by Aretes injunction sent.
<U+202D>  One bore an out and in-weed, fair and sweet,
<U+202D>  The other an embroiderd cabinet,
<U+202D>  The third had bread to bear, and ruddy wine;
<U+202D>  All which, at sea and ship arrivd, resign
<U+202D>  Their freight conferrd.  With fair attendants then,
<U+202D>  The sheets and bedding of the man of men,
<U+202D>  Within a cabin of the hollow keel,
<U+202D>  Spread, and made soft, that sleep might sweetly seel
<U+202D>  His restful eyes, he enterd, and his bed
<U+202D>  In silence took.  The rowers orderéd
<U+202D>  Themselves in sevral seats, and then set gone
<U+202D>  The ship, the gable from the hollow stone
<U+202D>  Dissolvd and weighd-up, all, together, close
<U+202D>  Then beat the sea.  His lids in sweet repose
<U+202D>  Sleep bound so fast, it scarce gave way to breath
<U+202D>  Inexcitable, most dear, next of all to death.
<U+202D>  And as amids a fair field four brave horse
<U+202D>  Before a chariot stung into their course
<U+202D>  With fervent lashes of the smarting scourge,
<U+202D>  That all their fire blows high, and makes them urge
<U+202D>  To utmost speed the measure of their ground;
<U+202D>  So bore the ship aloft her fiery bound;
<U+202D>  About whom rushd the billows black and vast,
<U+202D>  In which the sea-roars burst.  As firm as fast
<U+202D>  She plyd her course yet; nor her wingéd speed
<U+202D>  The falcon-gentle could for pace exceed;
<U+202D>  So cut she through the waves, and bore a man
<U+202D>  Even with the Gods in counsels, that began
<U+202D>  And spent his former life in all misease,
<U+202D>  Battles of men, and rude waves of the seas,
<U+202D>  Yet now securely slept, forgetting all.
<U+202D>  And when heavns brightest star, that first doth call
<U+202D>  The early morning out, advancd her head,
<U+202D>  Then near to Ithaca the billow-bred
<U+202D>  Phracian ship approachd.  There is a port,
<U+202D>  That th aged sea-God Phorcys makes his fort,
<U+202D>  Whose earth the Ithacensian people own,
<U+202D>  In which two rocks inaccessible are grown
<U+202D>  Far forth into the sea, whose each strength binds
<U+202D>  The boistrous waves in from the high-flown winds
<U+202D>  On both the out-parts so, that all within
<U+202D>  The well-built ships, that once their harbour win
<U+202D>  In his calm bosom, without anchor rest,
<U+202D>  Safe, and unstirrd.  From forth the havens high crest
<U+202D>  Branch the well-brawnd arms of an olive-tree;
<U+202D>  Beneath which runs a cave from all sun free,
<U+202D>  Cool, and delightsome, sacred to th access
<U+202D>  Of Nymphs whose surnames are the Naiadés;
<U+202D>  In which flew humming bees, in which lay thrown
<U+202D>  Stone cups, stone vessels, shittles all of stone,
<U+202D>  With which the Nymphs their purple mantles wove,
<U+202D>  In whose contexture art and wonder strove;
<U+202D>  In which pure springs perpetually ran;
<U+202D>  To which two entries were; the one for man,
<U+202D>  On which the North breathd;  th other for the Gods,
<U+202D>  On which the South; and that bore no abodes
<U+202D>  For earthy men, but only deathless feet
<U+202D>  Had there free way.  This port these men thought meet
<U+202D>  To land Ulysses, being the first they knew,
<U+202D>  Drew then their ship in, but no further drew
<U+202D>  Than half her bulk reachd, by such cunning hand
<U+202D>  Her course was managd.  Then her men took land,
<U+202D>  And first brought forth Ulysses, bed, and all
<U+202D>  That richly furnishd it, he still in thrall
<U+202D>  Of all-subduing sleep.  Upon the sand
<U+202D>  They set him softly down; and then the strand
<U+202D>  They strewd with all the goods he had, bestowd
<U+202D>  By the renownd Phaacians, since he showd
<U+202D>  So much Minerva.  At the olive root
<U+202D>  They drew them then in heap, most far from foot
<U+202D>  Of any traveller, lest, ere his eyes
<U+202D>  Resumd their charge, they might be others prise.
<U+202D>     These then turnd home; nor was the seas Supreme
<U+202D>  Forgetful of his threats, for Polypheme
<U+202D>  Bent at divine Ulysses, yet would prove
<U+202D>  (Ere their performance) the decree of Jove.
<U+202D>     Father!  no more the Gods shall honour me,
<U+202D>  Since men despise me, and those men that see
<U+202D>  The light in lineage of mine own lovd race.  [4]
<U+202D>  I vowd Ulysses should, before the grace
<U+202D>  Of his return, encounter woes enow
<U+202D>  To make that purchase dear; yet did not vow
<U+202D>  Simply against it, since thy brow had bent
<U+202D>  To his reduction, in the fore-consent
<U+202D>  Thou hadst vouchsafd it; yet, before my mind
<U+202D>  Hath full powr on him, the Phaacians find
<U+202D>  Their own minds satisfaction with his pass,
<U+202D>  So far from suffring what my pleasure was,
<U+202D>  That ease and softness now is habited
<U+202D>  In his secure breast, and his careless head
<U+202D>  Returnd in peace of sleep to Ithaca,
<U+202D>  The brass and gold of rich Phaacia
<U+202D>  Rocking his temples, garments richly wovn,
<U+202D>  And worlds of prise, more than was ever strovn
<U+202D>  From all the conflicts he sustaind at Troy,
<U+202D>  If safe he should his full share there enjoy.
<U+202D>     The Showr-dissolver answerd:  What a speech
<U+202D>  Hath passd thy palate, O thou great in reach
<U+202D>  Of wrackful empire!  Far the Gods remain
<U+202D>  From scorn of thee, for twere a work of pain
<U+202D>  To prosecute with ignominies one
<U+202D>  That sways our ablest and most ancient throne.
<U+202D>  For men, if any so beneath in powr
<U+202D>  Neglect thy high will, now, or any hour
<U+202D>  That moves hereafter, take revenge to thee,
<U+202D>  Soothe all thy will, and be thy pleasure free.
<U+202D>     Why then,  said he,  thou blacker of the fumes
<U+202D>  That dim the sun, my licensd powr resumes
<U+202D>  Act from thy speech; but I observe so much
<U+202D>  And fear thy pleasure, that, I dare not touch
<U+202D>  At any inclination of mine own,
<U+202D>  Till thy consenting influence be known.
<U+202D>  But now this curious-built Phaacian ship,
<U+202D>  Returning from her convoy, I will strip
<U+202D>  Of all her fleeting matter, and to stone
<U+202D>  Transform and fix it, just when she hath gone
<U+202D>  Her full time home, and jets before their prease
<U+202D>  In all her trim, amids the sable seas,
<U+202D>  That they may cease to convoy strangers still,
<U+202D>  When they shall see so like a mighty hill
<U+202D>  Their glory stick before their citys grace,
<U+202D>  And my hands cast a mask before her face.  [5]
<U+202D>     O friend,  said Jove,  it shows to me the best
<U+202D>  Of all earths objects, that their whole prease, drest
<U+202D>  In all their wonder, near their town shall stand,
<U+202D>  And stare upon a stone, so near the land,
<U+202D>  So like a ship, and dam up all their lights,
<U+202D>  As if a mountain interposd their sights.
<U+202D>     When Neptune heard this, he for Scheria went,
<U+202D>  Whence the Phaacians took their first descent.
<U+202D>  Which when he reachd, and, in her swiftest pride,
<U+202D>  The water-treader by the citys side
<U+202D>  Came cutting close, close he came swiftly on,
<U+202D>  Took her in violent hand, and to a stone
<U+202D>  Turnd all her sylvan substance; all below
<U+202D>  Firmd her with roots, and left her.  This strange show
<U+202D>  When the Phaacians saw, they stupid stood,
<U+202D>  And askd each other, who amids the flood
<U+202D>  Could fix their ship so in her full speed home,
<U+202D>  And quite transparent make her bulk become?
<U+202D>     Thus talkd they; but were far from knowing how
<U+202D>  These things had issue.  Which their king did show,
<U+202D>  And said:  O friends, the ancient prophecies
<U+202D>  My father told to me, to all our eyes
<U+202D>  Are now in proof.  He said, the time would come,
<U+202D>  When Neptune, for our safe conducting home
<U+202D>  All sorts of strangers, out of envy fird,
<U+202D>  Would meet our fairest ship as she retird,
<U+202D>  And all the goodly shape and speed we boast
<U+202D>  Should like a mountain stand before us lost
<U+202D>  Amids the moving waters; which we see
<U+202D>  Performd in full end to our prophecy.
<U+202D>  Hear then my counsel, and obey me then:
<U+202D>  Renounce henceforth our convoy home of men,
<U+202D>  Whoever shall hereafter greet our town;
<U+202D>  And to th offended Deitys renown
<U+202D>  Twelve chosen oxen let us sacred make,
<U+202D>  That he may pity us, and from us take
<U+202D>  This shady mountain.  They, in fear, obeyd,
<U+202D>  Slew all the beeves, and to the Godhead prayd,
<U+202D>  The dukes and princes all ensphering round
<U+202D>  The sacred altar; while whose tops were crownd,
<U+202D>  Divine Ulysses, on his countrys breast
<U+202D>  Laid bound in sleep, now rose out of his rest,
<U+202D>  Nor (being so long removd) the region knew.
<U+202D>  Besides which absence yet, Minerva threw
<U+202D>  A cloud about him, to make strange the more
<U+202D>  His safe arrival, lest upon his shore
<U+202D>  He should make known his face, and utter all
<U+202D>  That might prevent th event that was to fall.
<U+202D>  Which she prepard so well, that not his wife,
<U+202D>  Presented to him, should perceive his life,
<U+202D>  No citizen, no friend, till righteous fate
<U+202D>  Upon the Wooers wrongs were consummate.
<U+202D>  Through which cloud all things showd now to the king
<U+202D>  Of foreign fashion; the enflowréd spring
<U+202D>  Amongst the trees there, the perpetual waves,
<U+202D>  The rocks, that did more high their foreheads raise
<U+202D>  To his wrapt eye than naturally they did,
<U+202D>  And all the haven, in which a man seemd hid
<U+202D>  From wind and weather, when storms loudest chid.
<U+202D>     He therefore, being risen, stood and viewd
<U+202D>  His country-earth; which, not perceivd, he rued,
<U+202D>  And, striking with his hurld-down hands his thighs,
<U+202D>  He mournd, and said:  O me!  Again where lies
<U+202D>  My desert way?  To wrongful men and rude,
<U+202D>  And with no laws of human right endued?
<U+202D>  Or are they human, and of holy minds?
<U+202D>  What fits my deed with these so many kinds
<U+202D>  Of goods late givn?  What with myself will floods
<U+202D>  And errors do?  I would to God, these goods
<U+202D>  Had rested with their owners, and that I
<U+202D>  Had falln on kings of more regality,
<U+202D>  To grace out my return, that lovd indeed,
<U+202D>  And would have givn me consorts of fit speed
<U+202D>  To my distresses ending!  But, as now
<U+202D>  All knowledge flies me where I may bestow
<U+202D>  My labourd purchase, here they shall not stay,
<U+202D>  Lest what I card for others make their prey.
<U+202D>  O Gods!  I see the great Phaacians then
<U+202D>  Were not all just and understanding men,
<U+202D>  That land me elsewhere than their vaunts pretended,
<U+202D>  Assuring me my country should see ended
<U+202D>  My miseries told them, yet now eat their vaunts.
<U+202D>  O Jove!  Great Guardian of poor suppliants,
<U+202D>  That others sees, and notes too, shutting in
<U+202D>  All in thy plagues that most presume on sin,
<U+202D>  Revenge me on them.  Let me number now
<U+202D>  The goods they gave, to give my mind to know
<U+202D>  If they have stoln none in their close retreat.
<U+202D>     The goodly caldrons then, and tripods, set
<U+202D>  In sevral ranks from out the heap, he told,
<U+202D>  His rich wrought garments too, and all his gold,
<U+202D>  And nothing lackd; and yet this man did mourn
<U+202D>  The but supposd miss of his home-return,
<U+202D>  And creeping to the shore with much complaint;
<U+202D>  Minerva (like a shepherd, young, and quaint,  [6]
<U+202D>  As king sons are, a double mantle cast
<U+202D>  Athwart his shoulders, his fair goers gracd
<U+202D>  With fitted shoes, and in his hand a dart)
<U+202D>  Appeard to him, whose sight rejoicd his heart,
<U+202D>  To whom he came, and said:  O friend!  Since first
<U+202D>  I meet your sight here, be all good the worst
<U+202D>  That can join our encounter.  Fare you fair,
<U+202D>  Nor with adverse mind welcome my repair,
<U+202D>  But guard these goods of mine, and succour me.
<U+202D>  As to a God I offer prayrs to thee,
<U+202D>  And low access make to thy lovéd knee.
<U+202D>  Say truth, that I may know, what country then,
<U+202D>  What common people live here, and what men?
<U+202D>  Some famous isle is this?  Or gives it vent,
<U+202D>  Being near the sea, to some rich continent?
<U+202D>     She answerd:  Stranger, whatsoeer you are,
<U+202D>  Yare either foolish, or come passing far,
<U+202D>  That know not this isle, and make that doubt trouble,
<U+202D>  For tis not so exceedingly ignoble,
<U+202D>  But passing many know it; and so many,
<U+202D>  That of all nations there abides not any,
<U+202D>  From where the morning rises and the sun,
<U+202D>  To where the even and night their courses run,
<U+202D>  But know this country.  Rocky tis, and rough,
<U+202D>  And so for use of horse unapt enough,
<U+202D>  Yet with sad barrenness not much infested,  [7]
<U+202D>  Since clouds are here in frequent rains digested,
<U+202D>  And flowry dews.  The compass is not great,
<U+202D>  The little yet well-filld with wine and wheat.
<U+202D>  It feeds a goat and ox well, being still
<U+202D>  Waterd with floods, that ever over-fill
<U+202D>  With heavns continual showrs; and wooded so,
<U+202D>  It makes a spring of all the kinds that grow.
<U+202D>  And therefore, Stranger, the extended name
<U+202D>  Of this dominion makes access by fame
<U+202D>  From this extreme part of Achaia
<U+202D>  As far as Ilion, and tis Ithaca.
<U+202D>     This joyd him much, that so unknown a land
<U+202D>  Turnd to his country.  Yet so wise a hand
<U+202D>  He carried, evn of this joy, flown so high,
<U+202D>  That other end he put to his reply
<U+202D>  Than straight to show that joy, and lay abroad
<U+202D>  His life to strangers.  Therefore he bestowd
<U+202D>  A veil on truth; for evermore did wind
<U+202D>  About his bosom a most crafty mind,
<U+202D>  Which thus his words showd:  I have far at sea,
<U+202D>  In spacious Crete, heard speak of Ithaca,
<U+202D>  Of which myself, it seems, now reach the shore,
<U+202D>  With these my fortunes; whose whole value more
<U+202D>  I left in Crete amongst my children there,
<U+202D>  From whence I fly for being the slaughterer
<U+202D>  Of royal Idomens most-lovéd son,
<U+202D>  Swift-foot Orsilochus, that could out-run
<U+202D>  Professd men for the race.  Yet him I slew,
<U+202D>  Because he would deprive me of my due
<U+202D>  In Trojan prise; for which I sufferd so
<U+202D>  (The rude waves piercing) the redoubled woe
<U+202D>  Of mind and body in the wars of men.
<U+202D>  Nor did I gratify his father then
<U+202D>  With any service, but, as well as he
<U+202D>  Swayd in command of other soldiery,
<U+202D>  So, with a friend withdrawn, we waylaid him,
<U+202D>  When gloomy night the cope of heavn did dim,
<U+202D>  And no man knew; but, we lodgd close, he came,
<U+202D>  And I put out to him his vital flame.
<U+202D>  Whose slaughter having authord with my sword,
<U+202D>  I instant flight made, and straight fell aboard
<U+202D>  A ship of the renownd Phonician state;
<U+202D>  When prayr, and pay at a sufficient rate,
<U+202D>  Obtaind my pass of men in her command;
<U+202D>  Whom I enjoind to set me on the land
<U+202D>  Of Pylos, or of Elis the divine,
<U+202D>  Where the Epeians in great empire shine.
<U+202D>  But force of weather checkd that course to them,
<U+202D>  Though (loth to fail me) to their most extreme
<U+202D>  They spent their willing powrs.   But, forcd from thence,
<U+202D>  We errd, and put in here, with much expence
<U+202D>  Of care and labour; and in dead of night,
<U+202D>  When no man there servd any appetite
<U+202D>  So much as with the memory of food,
<U+202D>  Though our estates exceeding needy stood.
<U+202D>  But, going ashore, we lay; when gentle sleep
<U+202D>  My weary powrs invaded, and from ship
<U+202D>  They fetching these my riches, with just hand
<U+202D>  About me laid them, while upon the sand
<U+202D>  Sleep bound my senses; and for Sidon they
<U+202D>  (Put off from hence) made sail, while here I lay,
<U+202D>  Left sad alone.  The Goddess laughd, and took
<U+202D>  His hand in hers, and with another look
<U+202D>  (Assuming then the likeness of a dame,
<U+202D>  Lovely and goodly, expert in the frame
<U+202D>  Of virtuous housewifries) she answerd thus:
<U+202D>     He should be passing-sly, and covetous
<U+202D>  Of stealth, in mens deceits, that coted thee  [8]
<U+202D>  In any craft, though any God should be
<U+202D>  Ambitious to exceed in subtilty.
<U+202D>  Thou still-wit-varying wretch!  Insatiate  [9]
<U+202D>  In over-reaches!  Not secure thy state
<U+202D>  Without these wiles, though on thy native shore
<U+202D>  Thou settst safe footing, but upon thy store
<U+202D>  Of false words still spend, that evn from thy birth
<U+202D>  Have been thy best friends?  Come, our either worth
<U+202D>  Is known to either.  Thou of men art far,
<U+202D>  For words and counsels, the most singular,
<U+202D>  But I above the Gods in both may boast
<U+202D>  My still-tried faculties.  Yet thou hast lost
<U+202D>  The knowledge evn of me, the Seed of Jove,
<U+202D>  Pallas Athenia, that have still out-strove
<U+202D>  In all thy labours their extremes, and stood
<U+202D>  Thy sure guard ever, making all thy good
<U+202D>  Known to the good Phaacians, and receivd.
<U+202D>  And now again I greet thee, to see weavd
<U+202D>  Fresh counsels for thee, and will take on me
<U+202D>  The close reserving of these goods for thee,
<U+202D>  Which the renownd Phaacian states bestowd
<U+202D>  At thy deduction homewards, only movd
<U+202D>  With my both spirit and counsel.  All which grace
<U+202D>  I now will amplify, and tell what case
<U+202D>  Thy household stands in, uttring all those pains
<U+202D>  That of mere need yet still must wrack thy veins.
<U+202D>  Do thou then freely bear, nor one word give
<U+202D>  To man nor dame to show thou yet dost live,
<U+202D>  But silent suffer over all again
<U+202D>  Thy sorrows past, and bear the wrongs of men.
<U+202D>     Goddess,  said he,  unjust men, and unwise,
<U+202D>  That author injuries and vanities,
<U+202D>  By vanities and wrongs should rather be
<U+202D>  Bound to this ill-abearing destiny,
<U+202D>  Than just and wise men.  What delight hath heavn,
<U+202D>  That lives unhurt itself, to suffer givn
<U+202D>  Up to all domage those poor few that strive
<U+202D>  To imitate it, and like the Deities live?
<U+202D>  But where you wonder that I know you not
<U+202D>  Through all your changes, that skill is not got
<U+202D>  By sleight or art, since thy most hard-hit face
<U+202D>  Is still distinguishd by thy free-givn grace;
<U+202D>  And therefore, truly to acknowledge thee
<U+202D>  In thy encounters, is a mastery
<U+202D>  In men most-knowing; for to all men thou
<U+202D>  Takst sevral likeness.  All men think they know
<U+202D>  Thee in their wits; but, since thy seeming view
<U+202D>  Appears to all, and yet thy truth to few,
<U+202D>  Through all thy changes to discern thee right
<U+202D>  Asks chief love to thee, and inspiréd light.
<U+202D>  But this I surely know, that, some years past,
<U+202D>  I have been often with thy presence gracd,
<U+202D>  All time the sons of Greece wagd war at Troy;
<U+202D>  But when Fates full hour let our swords enjoy
<U+202D>  Our vows in sack of Priams lofty town,
<U+202D>  Our ships all boarded, and when God had blown
<U+202D>  Our fleet in sunder, I could never see
<U+202D>  The Seed of Jove, nor once distinguish thee
<U+202D>  Boarding my ship, to take one woe from me.
<U+202D>  But only in my proper spirit involvd,
<U+202D>  Errd here and there, quite slain, till heavn dissolvd
<U+202D>  Me, and my ill; which chancd not, till thy grace
<U+202D>  By open speech confirmd me, in a place
<U+202D>  Fruitful of people, where, in person, thou
<U+202D>  Didst give me guide, and all their city show;
<U+202D>  And that was the renownd Phaacian earth.
<U+202D>  Now then, evn by the Author of thy birth,
<U+202D>  Vouchsafe my doubt the truth (for far it flies
<U+202D>  My thoughts that thus should fall into mine eyes
<U+202D>  Conspicuous Ithaca, but fear I touch
<U+202D>  At some far shore, and that thy wit is such
<U+202D>  Thou dost delude me) is it sure the same
<U+202D>  Most honourd earth that bears my countrys name?
<U+202D>     I see,  said she,  thou wilt be ever thus
<U+202D>  In evry worldly good incredulous,
<U+202D>  And therefore have no more the powr to see
<U+202D>  Frail life more plagued with infelicity
<U+202D>  In one so eloquent, ingenious, wise.
<U+202D>  Another man, that so long miseries
<U+202D>  Had kept from his lovd home, and thus returnd
<U+202D>  To see his house, wife, children, would have burnd
<U+202D>  In headlong lust to visit.  Yet t inquire
<U+202D>  What states they hold, affects not thy desire,
<U+202D>  Till thou hast tried if in thy wife there be
<U+202D>  A sorrow wasting days and nights for thee
<U+202D>  In loving tears, that then the sight may prove
<U+202D>  A full reward for eithers mutual love.
<U+202D>  But I would never credit in you both
<U+202D>  Least cause of sorrow, but well knew the troth
<U+202D>  Of this thine own return, though all thy friends,
<U+202D>  I knew as well, should make returnless ends;
<U+202D>  Yet would not cross mine uncle Neptune so
<U+202D>  To stand their safeguard, since so high did go
<U+202D>  His wrath for thy extinction of the eye
<U+202D>  Of his lovd son.  Come then, Ill show thee why
<U+202D>  I call this isle thy Ithaca, to ground
<U+202D>  Thy credit on my words: This haven is ownd
<U+202D>  By th agéd sea-god Phorcys, in whose brow
<U+202D>  This is the olive with the ample bough,
<U+202D>  And here, close by, the pleasant-shaded cave
<U+202D>  That to the Fount-Nymphs th Ithacensians gave,
<U+202D>  As sacred to their pleasures.  Here doth run
<U+202D>  The large and coverd den, where thou hast done
<U+202D>  Hundreds of offrings to the Naiades,
<U+202D>  Here Mount Neritus shakes his curléd tress
<U+202D>  Of shady woods.  This said, she cleard the cloud
<U+202D>  That first deceivd his eyes; and all things showd
<U+202D>  His country to him.  Glad he stood with sight
<U+202D>  Of his lovd soil, and kissd it with delight;
<U+202D>  And instantly to all the Nymphs he paid
<U+202D>  (With hands held up to heavn) these vows, and said:
<U+202D>     Ye Nymphs the Naiades, great Seed of Jove,
<U+202D>  I had conceit that never more should move
<U+202D>  Your sight in these spheres of my erring eyes,
<U+202D>  And therefore, in the fuller sacrifice
<U+202D>  Of my hearts gratitude, rejoice, till more
<U+202D>  I pay your names in offrings as before;
<U+202D>  Which here I vow, if Joves benign descent,
<U+202D>  The mighty Pillager, with life convent
<U+202D>  My person home, and to my savd decease
<U+202D>  Of my lovd sons sight add the sweet increase.
<U+202D>  Be confident,  said Pallas,  nor oppress
<U+202D>  Thy spirits with care of these performances,
<U+202D>  But these thy fortunes let us straight repose
<U+202D>  In this divine caves bosom, that may close
<U+202D>  Reserve their value; and we then may see
<U+202D>  How best to order other acts to thee.
<U+202D>     Thus enterd she the light-excluding cave,
<U+202D>  And through it sought some inmost nook to save
<U+202D>  The gold, the great brass, and robes richly-wrought,
<U+202D>  Givn to Ulysses.  All which in he brought,
<U+202D>  Laid down in heap; and she imposd a stone
<U+202D>  Close to the caverns mouth.  Then sat they on
<U+202D>  The sacred olives root, consulting how
<U+202D>  To act th insulting Wooers overthrow;
<U+202D>  When Pallas said:  Examine now the means
<U+202D>  That best may lay hands on the impudence
<U+202D>  Of those proud Wooers, that have now three years
<U+202D>  Thy roofs rule swayd, and been bold offerers
<U+202D>  Of suit and gifts to thy renownéd wife,
<U+202D>  Who for thy absence all her desolate life
<U+202D>  Dissolves in tears till thy desird return;
<U+202D>  Yet all her Wooers, while she thus doth mourn,
<U+202D>  She holds in hope, and evry one affords
<U+202D>  (In fore-sent message) promise; but her words
<U+202D>  Bear other uttrance than her heart approves.
<U+202D>     O Gods,  said Ithacus,  it now behoves
<U+202D>  My fate to end me in the ill decease
<U+202D>  That Agamemnon underwent, unless
<U+202D>  You tell me, and in time; their close intents.
<U+202D>  Advise then means to the revengd events
<U+202D>  We both resolve on.  Be thyself so kind
<U+202D>  To stand close to me, and but such a mind
<U+202D>  Breathe in my bosom, as when th Ilion towrs
<U+202D>  We tore in cinders.  O if equal powrs
<U+202D>  Thou wouldst enflame amidst my nerves as then,
<U+202D>  I could encounter with three hundred men,
<U+202D>  Thy only self, great Goddess, had to friend,
<U+202D>  In those brave ardors thou wert wont t extend!
<U+202D>     I will be strongly with thee,  answerd she,
<U+202D>  Nor must thou fail, but do thy part with me.
<U+202D>  When both whose powrs combine, I hope the bloods
<U+202D>  And brains of some of these that waste thy goods
<U+202D>  Shall strew thy goodly pavements.  Join we then:
<U+202D>  I first will render thee unknown to men,
<U+202D>  And on thy solid lineaments make dry
<U+202D>  Thy now smooth skin; thy bright-brown curls imply
<U+202D>  In hoary mattings; thy broad shoulders clothe
<U+202D>  In such a cloak as evry eye shall lothe;
<U+202D>  Thy bright eyes blear and wrinkle; and so change
<U+202D>  Thy form at all parts, that thou shalt be strange
<U+202D>  To all the Wooers, thy young son, and wife.
<U+202D>  But to thy herdsman first present thy life,
<U+202D>  That guards thy swine, and wisheth well to thee,
<U+202D>  That loves thy son and wife Penelopé.
<U+202D>  Thy search shall find him set aside his herd,
<U+202D>  That are with taste-delighting acorns reard,
<U+202D>  And drink the dark-deep water of the spring,
<U+202D>  Bright Arethusa, the most nourishing
<U+202D>  Raiser of herds.  There stay, and, taking seat
<U+202D>  Aside thy herdsman, of the whole state treat
<U+202D>  Of home-occurrents, while I make access
<U+202D>  To fair-dame-breeding Sparta for regress
<U+202D>  Of lovd Telemachus, who went in quest
<U+202D>  Of thy lovd fame, and livd the welcome guest
<U+202D>  Of Menelaus.  The much-knower said:
<U+202D>     Why wouldst not thou, in whose grave breast is bred
<U+202D>  The art to order all acts, tell in this
<U+202D>  His error to him?  Let those years of his
<U+202D>  Amids the rude seas wander, and sustain
<U+202D>  The woes there raging, while unworthy men
<U+202D>  Devour his fortunes?  Let not care extend
<U+202D>  Thy heart for him,  said she,  myself did send
<U+202D>  His person in thy search; to set his worth,
<U+202D>  By good fame blown, to such a distance forth.
<U+202D>  Nor suffers he in any least degree
<U+202D>  The grief you fear, but all variety
<U+202D>  That Plenty can yield in her quietst fare,
<U+202D>  In Menelaus court, doth sit and share.
<U+202D>  In whose return from home, the Wooers yet
<U+202D>  Lay bloody ambush, and a ship have set
<U+202D>  To sea, to intercept his life before
<U+202D>  He touch again his births attempted shore.
<U+202D>  All which, my thoughts say, they shall never do,
<U+202D>  But rather, that the earth shall overgo
<U+202D>  Some one at least of these love-making men,
<U+202D>  By which thy goods so much impair sustain.
<U+202D>  Thus using certain secret words to him,
<U+202D>  She touchd him with her rod; and evry limb
<U+202D>  Was hid all-over with a witherd skin;
<U+202D>  His bright eyes bleard; his brow-curls white and thin;
<U+202D>  And all things did an agéd man present.
<U+202D>  Then, for his own weeds, shirt and coat, all-rent,
<U+202D>  Tannd, and all-sootiéd with noisome smoke,
<U+202D>  She put him on; and, over all, a cloke
<U+202D>  Made of a stags huge hide, of which was worn
<U+202D>  The hair quite off; a scrip, all-patchd and torn,
<U+202D>  Hung by a cord, oft broke and knit again;
<U+202D>  And with a staff did his old limbs sustain.
<U+202D>  Thus having both consulted of th event,
<U+202D>  They parted both; and forth to Sparta went
<U+202D>  The gray-eyed Goddess, to see all things done
<U+202D>  That appertaind to wise Ulysses son.
