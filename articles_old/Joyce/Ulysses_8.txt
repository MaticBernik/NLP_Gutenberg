--Is the brother with you, Malachi?
--Down in Westmeath. With the Bannons.
--Still there? I got a card from Bannon. Says he found a sweet young
thing down there. Photo girl he calls her.
--Snapshot, eh? Brief exposure.
Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots. An elderly man shot up near
the spur of rock a blowing red face. He scrambled up by the stones,
water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water
rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black
sagging loincloth.
Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at Haines
and Stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips
and breastbone.
--Seymour's back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of
rock. Chucked medicine and going in for the army.
--Ah, go to God! Buck Mulligan said.
--Going over next week to stew. You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily?
--Yes.
--Spooning with him last night on the pier. The father is rotto with
money.
--Is she up the pole?
--Better ask Seymour that.
--Seymour a bleeding officer! Buck Mulligan said.
He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying
tritely:
--Redheaded women buck like goats.
He broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt.
--My twelfth rib is gone, he cried. I'm the _<dc>bermensch._ Toothless
Kinch and I, the supermen.
He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his
clothes lay.
--Are you going in here, Malachi?
--Yes. Make room in the bed.
The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached
the middle of the creek in two long clean strokes. Haines sat down on a
stone, smoking.
--Are you not coming in? Buck Mulligan asked.
--Later on, Haines said. Not on my breakfast.
Stephen turned away.
--I'm going, Mulligan, he said.
--Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat.
Stephen handed him the key. Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped
clothes.
--And twopence, he said, for a pint. Throw it there.
Stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap. Dressing, undressing. Buck
Mulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly:
--He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord. Thus spake
Zarathustra.
His plump body plunged.
--We'll see you again, Haines said, turning as Stephen walked up the
path and smiling at wild Irish.
Horn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a Saxon.
--The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried. Half twelve.
--Good, Stephen said.
He walked along the upwardcurving path.
     _Liliata rutilantium.
     Turma circumdet.
     Iubilantium te virginum._
The priest's grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly. I will
not sleep here tonight. Home also I cannot go.
A voice, sweettoned and sustained, called to him from the sea. Turning
the curve he waved his hand. It called again. A sleek brown head, a
seal's, far out on the water, round.
