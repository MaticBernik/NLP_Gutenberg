<U+202D>  The man, O Muse, inform, that many a way  [1]
<U+202D>  Wound with his wisdom to his wished stay;
<U+202D>  That wanderd wondrous far, when he the town
<U+202D>  Of sacred Troy had sackd and shiverd down;
<U+202D>  The cities of a world of nations,
<U+202D>  With all their manners, minds, and fashions,
<U+202D>  He saw and knew; at sea felt many woes,
<U+202D>  Much care sustaind, to save from overthrows
<U+202D>  Himself and friends in their retreat for home;
<U+202D>  But so their fates he could not overcome,
<U+202D>  Though much he thirsted it.  O men unwise,
<U+202D>  They perishd by their own impieties!
<U+202D>  That in their hungers rapine would not shun
<U+202D>  The oxen of the lofty-going Sun,
<U+202D>  Who therefore from their eyes the day bereft
<U+202D>  Of safe return.  These acts, in some part left,
<U+202D>  Tell us, as others, deified Seed of Jove.
<U+202D>     Now all the rest that austere death outstrove
<U+202D>  At Troys long siege at home safe anchord are,
<U+202D>  Free from the malice both of sea and war;
<U+202D>  Only Ulysses is denied access
<U+202D>  To wife and home.  The grace of Goddesses,
<U+202D>  The revrend nymph Calypso, did detain
<U+202D>  Him in her caves, past all the race of men
<U+202D>  Enflamd to make him her lovd lord and spouse.
<U+202D>  And when the Gods had destind that his house,
<U+202D>  Which Ithaca on her rough bosom bears,
<U+202D>  (The point of time wrought out by ambient years)
<U+202D>  Should be his haven, Contention still extends
<U+202D>  Her envy to him, evn amongst his friends.
<U+202D>  All Gods took pity on him; only he,
<U+202D>  That girds earth in the cincture of the sea,
<U+202D>  Divine Ulysses ever did envy,
<U+202D>  And made the fixd port of his birth to fly.
<U+202D>     But he himself solemnizd a retreat
<U+202D>  To th Athiops, far dissunderd in their seat,
<U+202D>  (In two parts parted, at the suns descent,
<U+202D>  And underneath his golden orient,
<U+202D>  The first and last of men) t enjoy their feast
<U+202D>  Of bulls and lambs, in hecatombs addrest;  [2]
<U+202D>  At which he sat, givn over to delight.
<U+202D>     The other Gods in heavns supremest height
<U+202D>  Were all in council met; to whom began
<U+202D>  The mighty Father both of God and man
<U+202D>  Discourse, inducing matter that inclind
<U+202D>  To wise Ulysses, calling to his mind
<U+202D>  Faultful Agisthus, who to death was done  [3]
<U+202D>  By young Orestes, Agamemnons son.
<U+202D>  His memory to the Immortals then
<U+202D>  Movd Jove thus deeply:  O how falsely men
<U+202D>  Accuse us Gods as authors of their ill!
<U+202D>  When, by the bane their own bad lives instill,
<U+202D>  They suffer all the misries of their states,
<U+202D>  Past our inflictions, and beyond their fates.
<U+202D>  As now Agisthus, past his fate, did wed
<U+202D>  The wife of Agamemnon, and (in dread
<U+202D>  To suffer death himself) to shun his ill,
<U+202D>  Incurrd it by the loose bent of his will,
<U+202D>  In slaughtering Atrides in retreat.
<U+202D>  Which we foretold him would so hardly set
<U+202D>  To his murdrous purpose, sending Mercury
<U+202D>  That slaughterd Argus, our considrate spy,
<U+202D>  To give him this charge: Do not wed his wife,
<U+202D>  Nor murder him; for thou shalt buy his life
<U+202D>  With ransom of thine own, imposd on thee
<U+202D>  By his Orestes, when in him shall be
<U+202D>  Atrides-self renewd, and but the prime
<U+202D>  Of youths spring put abroad, in thirst to climb
<U+202D>  His haughty fathers throne by his high acts.
<U+202D>  These words of Hermes wrought not into facts
<U+202D>  Agisthus powers; good counsel he despisd,
<U+202D>  And to that good his ill is sacrificd.
<U+202D>     Pallas, whose eyes did sparkle like the skies,
<U+202D>  Answerd: O Sire! Supreme of Deities,
<U+202D>  Agisthus passd his fate, and had desert
<U+202D>  To warrant our infliction; and convert
<U+202D>  May all the pains such impious men inflict
<U+202D>  On innocent suffrers to revenge as strict,
<U+202D>  Their own hearts eating.  But, that Ithacus,
<U+202D>  Thus never meriting, should suffer thus,
<U+202D>  I deeply suffer.  His more pious mind
<U+202D>  Divides him from these fortunes.  Though unkind
<U+202D>  Is piety to him, giving him a fate
<U+202D>  More suffring than the most unfortunate,
<U+202D>  So long kept friendless in a sea-girt soil,
<U+202D>  Where the seas navel is a sylvan isle,
<U+202D>  In which the Goddess dwells that doth derive
<U+202D>  Her birth from Atlas, who of all alive
<U+202D>  The motion and the fashion doth command
<U+202D>  With his wise mind, whose forces understand  [4]
<U+202D>  The inmost deeps and gulfs of all the seas,
<U+202D>  Who (for his skill of things superior) stays
<U+202D>  The two steep columns that prop earth and heavn.
<U+202D>  His daughter tis, who holds this homeless-drivn  [5]
<U+202D>  Still mourning with her; evermore profuse
<U+202D>  Of soft and winning speeches, that abuse
<U+202D>  And make so languishingly, and possest  [6]
<U+202D>  With so remiss a mind her loved guest,
<U+202D>  Manage the action of his way for home.
<U+202D>  Where he, though in affection overcome,
<U+202D>  In judgment yet more longs to show his hopes
<U+202D>  His countrys smoke leap from her chimney tops,
<U+202D>  And death asks in her arms.  Yet never shall
<U+202D>  Thy lovd heart be converted on his thrall,
<U+202D>  Austere Olympius.  Did not ever he,
<U+202D>  In ample Troy, thy altars gratify,
<U+202D>  And Grecians fleet make in thy offrings swim?
<U+202D>  Jove, why still then burns thy wrath to him?
<U+202D>     The Cloud-assembler answerd: What words fly,
<U+202D>  Bold daughter, from thy pale of ivory?  [7]
<U+202D>  As if I ever could cast from my care
<U+202D>  Divine Ulysses, who exceeds so far
<U+202D>  All men in wisdom, and so oft hath givn
<U+202D>  To all th Immortals thrond in ample heavn
<U+202D>  So great and sacred gifts?  But his decrees,
<U+202D>  That holds the earth in with his nimble knees,
<U+202D>  Stand to Ulysses longings so extreme,
<U+202D>  For taking from the God-foe Polypheme
<U+202D>  His only eye; a Cyclop, that excelld
<U+202D>  All other Cyclops, with whose burden swelld
<U+202D>  The nymph Thoosa, the divine increase
<U+202D>  Of Phorcys seed, a great God of the seas.
<U+202D>  She mixd with Neptune in his hollow caves,
<U+202D>  And bore this Cyclop to that God of waves.
<U+202D>  For whose lost eye, th Earth-shaker did not kill
<U+202D>  Erring Ulysses, but reserves him still
<U+202D>  In life for more death.  But use we our powrs,
<U+202D>  And round about us cast these cares of ours,
<U+202D>  All to discover how we may prefer
<U+202D>  His wishd retreat, and Neptune make forbear
<U+202D>  His stern eye to him, since no one God can,
<U+202D>  In spite of all, prevail, but gainst a man.
<U+202D>     To this, this answer made the grey-eyed Maid:
<U+202D>  Supreme of rulers, since so well apaid
<U+202D>  The blesséd Gods are all then, now, in thee,
<U+202D>  To limit wise Ulysses misery,
<U+202D>  And that you speak as you referrd to me
<U+202D>  Prescription for the means, in this sort be
<U+202D>  Their sacred order: Let us now address
<U+202D>  With utmost speed our swift Argicides,
<U+202D>  To tell the nymph that bears the golden tress
<U+202D>  In th isle Ogygia, that tis our will
<U+202D>  She should not stay our lovd Ulysses still,
<U+202D>  But suffer his return; and then will I
<U+202D>  To Ithaca, to make his son apply
<U+202D>  His sires inquest the more; infusing force
<U+202D>  Into his soul, to summon the concourse
<U+202D>  Of curld-head Greeks to council, and deter
<U+202D>  Each wooer, that hath been the slaughterer
<U+202D>  Of his fat sheep and crooked-headed beeves.
<U+202D>  From more wrong to his mother, and their leaves
<U+202D>  Take in such terms as fit deserts so great.
<U+202D>  To Sparta then, and Pylos, where doth beat
<U+202D>  Bright Amathus, the flood, and epithet
<U+202D>  To all that kingdom, my advice shall send
<U+202D>  The spirit-advancd Prince, to the pious end
<U+202D>  Of seeking his lost father, if he may
<U+202D>  Receive report from Fame where rests his stay;
<U+202D>  And make, besides, his own successive worth
<U+202D>  Known to the world, and set in action forth.
<U+202D>     This said, her wingd shoes to her feet she tied,
<U+202D>  Formd all of gold, and all eternified,
<U+202D>  That on the round earth or the sea sustaind
<U+202D>  Her ravishd substance swift as gusts of wind.
<U+202D>  Then took she her strong lance with steel made keen,
<U+202D>  Great, massy, active, that whole hosts of men,
<U+202D>  Though all heroës, conquers, if her ire
<U+202D>  Their wrongs inflame, backd by so great a Sire.
<U+202D>  Down from Olympus tops she headlong divd,
<U+202D>  And swift as thought in Ithaca arrivd,
<U+202D>  Close at Ulysses gates; in whose first court
<U+202D>  She made her stand, and, for her breasts support,
<U+202D>  Leand on her iron lance; her form imprest
<U+202D>  With Mentas likeness, come as being a guest.
<U+202D>  There found she those proud wooers, that were then
<U+202D>  Set on those ox-hides that themselves had slain,
<U+202D>  Before the gates, and all at dice were playing.
<U+202D>  To them the heralds, and the rest obeying,
<U+202D>  Filld wine and water; some, still as they playd,
<U+202D>  And some, for solemn suppers state, purveyd,
<U+202D>  With porous sponges cleansing tables, servd
<U+202D>  With much rich feast; of which to all they kervd.
<U+202D>     God-like Telemachus amongst them sat,
<U+202D>  Grievd much in mind; and in his heart begat
<U+202D>  All representment of his absent sire,
<U+202D>  How, come from far-off parts, his spirits would fire
<U+202D>  With those proud wooers sight, with slaughter parting
<U+202D>  Their bold concourse, and to himself converting
<U+202D>  The honours they usurpd, his own commanding.
<U+202D>     In this discourse, he first saw Pallas standing,
<U+202D>  Unbidden entry; up rose, and addrest
<U+202D>  His pace right to her, angry that a guest
<U+202D>  Should stand so long at gate; and, coming near,
<U+202D>  Her right hand took, took in his own her spear,
<U+202D>  And thus saluted:  Grace to your repair,
<U+202D>  Fair guest, your welcome shall be likewise fair.
<U+202D>  Enter, and, cheerd with feast, disclose th intent
<U+202D>  That causd your coming.  This said, first he went,
<U+202D>  And Pallas followd.  To a room they came,
<U+202D>  Steep, and of state; the javlin of the Dame
<U+202D>  He set against a pillar vast and high,
<U+202D>  Amidst a large and bright-kept armory,
<U+202D>  Which was, besides, with woods of lances gracd
<U+202D>  Of his grave fathers.  In a throne he placd
<U+202D>  The man-turnd Goddess, under which was spread
<U+202D>  A carpet, rich and of deviceful thread;
<U+202D>  A footstool staying her feet; and by her chair
<U+202D>  Another seat (all garnishd wondrous fair,
<U+202D>  To rest or sleep on in the day) he set,
<U+202D>  Far from the prease of wooers, lest at meat
<U+202D>  The noise they still made might offend his guest,
<U+202D>  Disturbing him at banquet or at rest,
<U+202D>  Evn to his combat with that pride of theirs,
<U+202D>  That kept no noble form in their affairs.
<U+202D>  And these he set far from them, much the rather
<U+202D>  To question freely of his absent father.
<U+202D>     A table fairly-polishd then was spread,
<U+202D>  On which a revrend officer set bread,
<U+202D>  And other servitors all sorts of meat
<U+202D>  (Salads, and flesh, such as their haste could get)
<U+202D>  Servd with observance in.  And then the sewer
<U+202D>  Pourd water from a great and golden ewer,
<U+202D>  That from their hands t a silver caldron ran.
<U+202D>  Both washd, and seated close, the voiceful man
<U+202D>  Fetchd cups of gold, and set by them, and round
<U+202D>  Those cups with wine with all endeavour crownd.
<U+202D>     Then rushd in the rude wooers, themselves placd;
<U+202D>  The heralds water gave; the maids in haste
<U+202D>  Servd bread from baskets.  When, of all prepard
<U+202D>  And set before them, the bold wooers shard,
<U+202D>  Their pages plying their cups past the rest.
<U+202D>  But lusty wooers must do more than feast;
<U+202D>  For now, their hungers and their thirsts allayd,
<U+202D>  They calld for songs and dances; those, they said,
<U+202D>  Were th ornaments of feast.  The herald straight
<U+202D>  A harp, carvd full of artificial sleight,
<U+202D>  Thrust into Phemius, a learnd singers, hand,
<U+202D>  Who, till he much was urgd, on terms did stand,
<U+202D>  But, after, playd and sung with all his art.
<U+202D>     Telemachus to Pallas then (apart,
<U+202D>  His ear inclining close, that none might hear)
<U+202D>  In this sort said:  My guest, exceeding dear,
<U+202D>  Will you not sit incensd with what I say?
<U+202D>  These are the cares these men take; feast and play.
<U+202D>  Which easly they may use, because they eat,
<U+202D>  Free and unpunishd, of anothers meat;
<U+202D>  And of a mans, whose white bones wasting lie
<U+202D>  In some far region; with th incessancy
<U+202D>  Of showrs pourd down upon them, lying ashore,
<U+202D>  Or in the seas washd nakd.  Who, if he wore
<U+202D>  Those bones with flesh and life and industry,
<U+202D>  And these might here in Ithaca set eye
<U+202D>  On him returnd, they all would wish to be
<U+202D>  Either past other in celerity
<U+202D>  Of feet and knees, and not contend t exceed
<U+202D>  In golden garments.  But his virtues feed
<U+202D>  The fate of ill death; nor is left to me
<U+202D>  The least hope of his lifes recovery,
<U+202D>  No, not if any of the mortal race
<U+202D>  Should tell me his return; the cheerful face
<U+202D>  Of his returnd day never will appear.
<U+202D>  But tell me, and let Truth your witness bear,
<U+202D>  Who, and from whence you are?  What citys birth?
<U+202D>  What parents?  In what vessel set you forth?
<U+202D>  And with what mariners arrivd you here?
<U+202D>  I cannot think you a foot passenger.
<U+202D>  Recount then to me all, to teach me well
<U+202D>  Fit usage for your worth.  And if it fell
<U+202D>  In chance now first that you thus see us here,
<U+202D>  Or that in former passages you were
<U+202D>  My fathers guest?  For many men have been
<U+202D>  Guests to my father.  Studious of men
<U+202D>  His sociable nature ever was.
<U+202D>  On him again the grey-eyed Maid did pass
<U+202D>  This kind reply:  Ill answer passing true
<U+202D>  All thou hast askd: My birth his honour drew
<U+202D>  From wise Anchialus.  The name I bear
<U+202D>  Is Mentas, the commanding islander
<U+202D>  Of all the Taphians studious in the art
<U+202D>  Of navigation; having touchd this part
<U+202D>  With ship and men, of purpose to maintain
<U+202D>  Course through the dark seas t other-languagd men;
<U+202D>  And Temesis sustains the citys name
<U+202D>  For which my ship is bound, made known by fame
<U+202D>  For rich in brass, which my occasions need,
<U+202D>  And therefore bring I shining steel in stead,
<U+202D>  Which their use wants, yet makes my vessels freight,
<U+202D>  That near a ploughd field rides at anchors weight,
<U+202D>  Apart this city, in the harbour calld
<U+202D>  Rhethrus, whose waves with Neius woods are walld.
<U+202D>  Thy sire and I were ever mutual guests,
<U+202D>  At eithers house still interchanging feasts.
<U+202D>  I glory in it.  Ask, when thou shalt see
<U+202D>  Laertes, th old heroë, these of me,
<U+202D>  From the beginning.   He, men say, no more
<U+202D>  Visits the city, but will needs deplore
<U+202D>  His sons believd loss in a private field;
<U+202D>  One old maid only at his hands to yield
<U+202D>  Food to his life, as oft as labour makes
<U+202D>  His old limbs faint; which, though he creeps, he takes
<U+202D>  Along a fruitful plain, set all with vines,
<U+202D>  Which husbandman-like, though a king, he proins.
<U+202D>  But now I come to be thy fathers guest;
<U+202D>  I hear he wanders, while these wooers feast.
<U+202D>  And (as th Immortals prompt me at this hour)
<U+202D>  Ill tell thee, out of a prophetic powr,
<U+202D>  (Not as professd a prophet, nor clear seen
<U+202D>  At all times what shall after chance to men)
<U+202D>  What I conceive, for this time, will be true:
<U+202D>  The Gods inflictions keep your sire from you.
<U+202D>  Divine Ulysses, yet, abides not dead
<U+202D>  Above earth, nor beneath, nor buried
<U+202D>  In any seas, as you did late conceive,
<U+202D>  But, with the broad sea siegd, is kept alive
<U+202D>  Within an isle by rude and upland men,
<U+202D>  That in his spite his passage home detain.
<U+202D>  Yet long it shall not be before he tread
<U+202D>  His countrys dear earth, though solicited,
<U+202D>  And held from his return, with iron chains;
<U+202D>  For he hath wit to forge a world of trains,
<U+202D>  And will, of all, be sure to make good one
<U+202D>  For his return, so much relied upon.
<U+202D>  But tell me, and be true: Art thou indeed
<U+202D>  So much a son, as to be said the seed  [8]
<U+202D>  Of Ithacus himself?  Exceeding much
<U+202D>  Thy forehead and fair eyes at his form touch;
<U+202D>  For oftentimes we met, as you and I
<U+202D>  Meet at this hour, before he did apply
<U+202D>  His powrs for Troy, when other Grecian states
<U+202D>  In hollow ships were his associates.
<U+202D>  But, since that time, mine eyes could never see
<U+202D>  Renownd Ulysses, nor met his with me.
<U+202D>     The wise Telemachus again replied:
<U+202D>  You shall with all I know be satisfied.
<U+202D>  My mother certain says I am his son;
<U+202D>  I know not; nor was ever simply known
<U+202D>  By any child the sure truth of his sire.
<U+202D>  But would my veins had took in living fire
<U+202D>  From some man happy, rather than one wise,
<U+202D>  Whom age might see seisd of what youth made prise.
<U+202D>  But he whoever of the mortal race
<U+202D>  Is most unblest, he holds my fathers place.
<U+202D>  This, since you ask, I answer. She, again:
<U+202D>     The Gods sure did not make the future strain
<U+202D>  Both of thy race and days obscure to thee,
<U+202D>  Since thou wert born so of Penelope.
<U+202D>  The style may by thy after acts be won,
<U+202D>  Of so great sire the high undoubted son.
<U+202D>     Say truth in this then: Whats this feasting here?
<U+202D>  What all this rout?  Is all this nuptial cheer?
<U+202D>  Or else some friendly banquet made by thee?
<U+202D>  For here no shots are, where all sharers be.
<U+202D>  Past measure contumeliously this crew
<U+202D>  Fare through thy house; which should th ingenuous view
<U+202D>  Of any good or wise man come and find,
<U+202D>  (Impiety seeing playd in evry kind)
<U+202D>  He could not but through evry vein be movd.
<U+202D>     Again Telemachus: My guest much lovd.
<U+202D>  Since you demand and sift these sights so far,
<U+202D>  I grant twere fit a house so regular,
<U+202D>  Rich, and so faultless once in government,
<U+202D>  Should still at all parts the same form present
<U+202D>  That gave it glory while her lord was here.
<U+202D>  But now the Gods, that us displeasure bear,
<U+202D>  Have otherwise appointed, and disgrace
<U+202D>  My father most of all the mortal race.
<U+202D>  For whom I could not mourn so were he dead,
<U+202D>  Amongst his fellow-captains slaughteréd
<U+202D>  By common enemies, or in the hands
<U+202D>  Of his kind friends had ended his commands,
<U+202D>  After he had egregiously bestowd
<U+202D>  His powr and order in a war so vowd,
<U+202D>  And to his tomb all Greeks their grace had done,
<U+202D>  That to all ages he might leave his son
<U+202D>  Immortal honour; but now Harpies have
<U+202D>  Diggd in their gorges his abhorréd grave.
<U+202D>  Obscure, inglorious, death hath made his end,
<U+202D>  And me, for glories, to all griefs contend.
<U+202D>  Nor shall I any more mourn him alone,
<U+202D>  The Gods have givn me other cause of moan.
<U+202D>  For look how many optimates remain
<U+202D>  In Samos, or the shores Dulichian,
<U+202D>  Shady Zacynthus, or how many bear
<U+202D>  Rule in the rough brows of this island here;
<U+202D>  So many now my mother and this house
<U+202D>  At all parts make defamd and ruinous;
<U+202D>  And she her hateful nuptials nor denies,
<U+202D>  Nor will despatch their importunities,
<U+202D>  Though she beholds them spoil still as they feast
<U+202D>  All my free house yields, and the little rest
<U+202D>  Of my dead sire in me perhaps intend
<U+202D>  To bring ere long to some untimely end.
<U+202D>     This Pallas sighd and answerd:  O,  said she,
<U+202D>  Absent Ulysses is much missd by thee,
<U+202D>  That on these shameless suitors he might lay
<U+202D>  His wreakful hands.  Should he now come, and stay
<U+202D>  In thy courts first gates, armd with helm and shield,
<U+202D>  And two such darts as I have seen him wield,
<U+202D>  When first I saw him in our Taphian court,
<U+202D>  Feasting, and doing his deserts disport;
<U+202D>  When from Ephyrus he returnd by us
<U+202D>  From Ilus, son to Centaur Mermerus,
<U+202D>  To whom he travelld through the watry dreads,
<U+202D>  For bane to poison his sharp arrows heads,
<U+202D>  That death, but touchd, causd; which he would not give,
<U+202D>  Because he feard the Gods that ever live
<U+202D>  Would plague such death with death; and yet their fear
<U+202D>  Was to my fathers bosom not so dear
<U+202D>  As was thy fathers love; (for what he sought
<U+202D>  My loving father found him to a thought.)
<U+202D>  If such as then Ulysses might but meet
<U+202D>  With these proud wooers, all were at his feet
<U+202D>  But instant dead men, and their nuptialls
<U+202D>  Would prove as bitter as their dying galls.
<U+202D>  But these things in the Gods knees are reposd,
<U+202D>  If his return shall see with wreak inclosd,
<U+202D>  These in his house, or he return no more;
<U+202D>  And therefore I advise thee to explore
<U+202D>  All ways thyself, to set these wooers gone;
<U+202D>  To which end give me fit attentión:
<U+202D>  To-morrow into solemn council call
<U+202D>  The Greek heroës, and declare to all
<U+202D>  (The Gods being witness) what thy pleasure is.
<U+202D>  Command to towns of their nativity
<U+202D>  These frontless wooers.  If thy mothers mind
<U+202D>  Stands to her second nuptials so inclind,
<U+202D>  Return she to her royal fathers towrs,
<U+202D>  Where th one of these may wed her, and her dowrs
<U+202D>  Make rich, and such as may consort with grace
<U+202D>  So dear a daughter of so great a race
<U+202D>  And thee I warn as well (if thou as well
<U+202D>  Wilt hear and follow) take thy best-built sail,
<U+202D>  With twenty oars mannd, and haste t inquire
<U+202D>  Where the abode is of thy absent sire,
<U+202D>  If any can inform thee, or thine ear
<U+202D>  From Jove the fame of his retreat may hear,
<U+202D>  For chiefly Jove gives all that honours men.
<U+202D>     To Pylos first be thy addression then,
<U+202D>  To god-like Nestor; thence to Sparta haste,
<U+202D>  To gold-lockd Menelaus, who was last
<U+202D>  Of all the brass-armd Greeks that saild from Troy;
<U+202D>  And try from both these, if thou canst enjoy
<U+202D>  News of thy sires returnd life anywhere,
<U+202D>  Though sad thou sufferst in his search a year.
<U+202D>  If of his death thou hearst, return thou home,
<U+202D>  And to his memory erect a tomb,
<U+202D>  Performing parent-rites, of feast and game,
<U+202D>  Pompous, and such as best may fit his fame;
<U+202D>  And then thy mother a fit husband give.
<U+202D>  These past, consider how thou mayst deprive
<U+202D>  Of worthless life these wooers in thy house,
<U+202D>  By open force, or projects enginous.
<U+202D>  Things childish fit not thee; th art so no more.
<U+202D>  Hast thou not heard, how all men did adore
<U+202D>  Divine Orestes, after he had slain
<U+202D>  Agisthus murdring by a treachrous train
<U+202D>  His famous father?  Be then, my most lovd,
<U+202D>  Valiant and manly, evry way approvd
<U+202D>  As great as he.  I see thy person fit,
<U+202D>  Noble thy mind, and excellent thy wit,
<U+202D>  All givn thee so to use and manage here
<U+202D>  That evn past death they may their memories bear.
<U+202D>  In meantime Ill descend to ship and men,
<U+202D>  That much expect me.  Be observant then
<U+202D>  Of my advice, and careful to maintain
<U+202D>  In equal acts thy royal fathers reign.
<U+202D>     Telemachus replied: You ope, fair guest,
<U+202D>  A friends heart in your speech, as well exprest
<U+202D>  As might a father serve t inform his son;
<U+202D>  All which sure place have in my memory won.
<U+202D>  Abide yet, though your voyage calls away,
<U+202D>  That, having bathd, and dignified your stay
<U+202D>  With some more honour, you may yet beside
<U+202D>  Delight your mind by being gratified
<U+202D>  With some rich present taken in your way,
<U+202D>  That, as a jewel, your respect may lay
<U+202D>  Up in your treasury, bestowd by me,
<U+202D>  As free friends use to guests of such degree.
<U+202D>     Detain me not,  said she,  so much inclind
<U+202D>  To haste my voyage.  What thy loved mind
<U+202D>  Commands to give, at my return this way,
<U+202D>  Bestow on me, that I directly may
<U+202D>  Convey it home; which more of price to me
<U+202D>  The more it asks my recompense to thee.
<U+202D>     This said, away grey-eyed Minerva flew,
<U+202D>  Like to a mounting lark; and did endue
<U+202D>  His mind with strength and boldness, and much more
<U+202D>  Made him his father long for than before;
<U+202D>  And weighing better who his guest might be,
<U+202D>  He stood amazd, and thought a Deity
<U+202D>  Was there descended; to whose will he framd
<U+202D>  His powrs at all parts, and went so inflamd
<U+202D>  Amongst the wooers, who were silent set,
<U+202D>  To hear a poet sing the sad retreat
<U+202D>  The Greeks performd from Troy; which was from thence
<U+202D>  Proclaimd by Pallas, pain of her offence.
<U+202D>     When which divine song was perceivd to bear
<U+202D>  That mournful subject by the listning ear
<U+202D>  Of wise Penelope, Icarius seed,
<U+202D>  Who from an upper room had givn it heed,
<U+202D>  Down she descended by a winding stair,
<U+202D>  Not solely, but the state in her repair
<U+202D>  Two maids of honour made.  And when this queen
<U+202D>  Of women stoopd so low, she might be seen
<U+202D>  By all her wooers.  In the door, aloof,
<U+202D>  Entring the hall gracd with a goodly roof,
<U+202D>  She stood, in shade of graceful veils, implied
<U+202D>  About her beauties; on her either side,
<U+202D>  Her honourd women.  When, to tears movd, thus
<U+202D>  She chid the sacred singer: Phemiüs,
<U+202D>  You know a number more of these great deeds
<U+202D>  Of Gods and men, that are the sacred seeds,
<U+202D>  And proper subjects, of a poets song,
<U+202D>  And those due pleasures that to men belong,
<U+202D>  Besides these facts that furnish Troys retreat,
<U+202D>  Sing one of those to these, that round your seat
<U+202D>  They may with silence sit, and taste their wine;
<U+202D>  But cease this song, that through these ears of mine
<U+202D>  Conveys deservd occasion to my heart
<U+202D>  Of endless sorrows, of which the desert
<U+202D>  In me unmeasurd is past all these men,
<U+202D>  So endless is the memory I retain,
<U+202D>  And so desertful is that memory,
<U+202D>  Of such a man as hath a dignity
<U+202D>  So broad it spreads itself through all the pride
<U+202D>  Of Greece and Argos.  To the queen replied
<U+202D>  Inspird Telemachus:  Why thus envies
<U+202D>  My mother him that fits societies  [9]
<U+202D>  With so much harmony, to let him please
<U+202D>  His own mind in his will to honour these?
<U+202D>  For these ingenious and first sort of men,  [10]
<U+202D>  That do immediately from Jove retain
<U+202D>  Their singing raptures, are by Jove as well
<U+202D>  Inspird with choice of what their songs impell,
<U+202D>  Joves will is free in it, and therefore theirs.
<U+202D>  Nor is this man to blame, that the repairs
<U+202D>  The Greeks make homeward sings; for his fresh muse
<U+202D>  Men still most celebrate that sings most news.
<U+202D>     And therefore in his note your ears employ:
<U+202D>  For not Ulysses only lost in Troy
<U+202D>  The day of his return, but numbers more
<U+202D>  The deadly ruins of his fortunes bore.
<U+202D>  Go you then in, and take your work in hand,
<U+202D>  Your web, and distaff; and your maids command
<U+202D>  To ply their fit work.  Words to men are due,
<U+202D>  And those reproving counsels you pursue,
<U+202D>  And most to me of all men, since I bear
<U+202D>  The rule of all things that are managd here.
<U+202D>  She went amazd away, and in her heart
<U+202D>  Laid up the wisdom Pallas did impart
<U+202D>  To her lovd son so lately, turnd again
<U+202D>  Up to her chamber, and no more would reign
<U+202D>  In manly counsels.  To her women she
<U+202D>  Applied her sway; and to the wooers he
<U+202D>  Began new orders, other spirits bewrayd
<U+202D>  Than those in spite of which the wooers swayd.
<U+202D>  And (whiles his mothers tears still washd her eyes,
<U+202D>  Till grey Minerva did those tears surprise
<U+202D>  With timely sleep, and that her wooers did rouse
<U+202D>  Rude tumult up through all the shady house,
<U+202D>  Disposd to sleep because their widow was)
<U+202D>  Telemachus this new-givn spirit did pass
<U+202D>  On their old insolence:  Ho! you that are,
<U+202D>  My mothers wooers!  much too high ye bear
<U+202D>  Your petulant spirits; sit; and, while ye may
<U+202D>  Enjoy me in your banquets, see ye lay
<U+202D>  These loud notes down, nor do this man the wrong,
<U+202D>  Because my mother hath disliked his song,
<U+202D>  To grace her interruption.  Tis a thing
<U+202D>  Honest, and honourd too, to hear one sing
<U+202D>  Numbers so like the Gods in elegance,
<U+202D>  As this man flows in.  By the morns first light,  [11]
<U+202D>  Ill call ye all before me in a Court,
<U+202D>  That I may clearly banish your resort,
<U+202D>  With all your rudeness, from these roofs of mine.
<U+202D>  Away; and elsewhere in your feasts combine.
<U+202D>  Consume your own goods, and make mutual feast
<U+202D>  At eithers house.  Or if ye still hold best,
<U+202D>  And for your humours more sufficéd fill,
<U+202D>  To feed, to spoil, because unpunishd still,
<U+202D>  On other findings, spoil; but here I call
<U+202D>  Th Eternal Gods to witness, if it fall
<U+202D>  In my wishd reach once to be dealing wreaks,
<U+202D>  By Joves high bounty, these your present checks
<U+202D>  To what I give in charge shall add more reins
<U+202D>  To my revenge hereafter; and the pains
<U+202D>  Ye then must suffer shall pass all your pride
<U+202D>  Ever to see redressd, or qualified.
<U+202D>     At this all bit their lips, and did admire
<U+202D>  His words sent from him with such phrase and fire;
<U+202D>  Which so much movd them that Antinous,
<U+202D>  Eupitheus son, cried out:  Telemachus!
<U+202D>  The Gods, I think, have rapt thee to this height
<U+202D>  Of elocution, and this great conceit
<U+202D>  Of self-ability.  We all may pray,
<U+202D>  That Jove invest not in this kingdoms sway
<U+202D>  Thy forward forces, which I see put forth
<U+202D>  A hot ambition in thee for thy birth.
<U+202D>     Be not offended,  he replied,  if I  [12]
<U+202D>  Shall say, I would assume this empery,
<U+202D>  If Jove gave leave.  You are not he that sings:
<U+202D>  _The rule of kingdoms is the worst of things._
<U+202D>  Nor is it ill, at all, to sway a throne;
<U+202D>  A man may quickly gain possession
<U+202D>  Of mighty riches, make a wondrous prize
<U+202D>  Set of his virtues; but the dignities
<U+202D>  That deck a king, there are enough beside
<U+202D>  In this circumfluous isle that want no pride
<U+202D>  To think them worthy of, as young as I,
<U+202D>  And old as you are.  An ascent so high
<U+202D>  My thoughts affect not.  Dead is he that held
<U+202D>  Desert of virtue to have so excelld.
<U+202D>  But of these turrets I will take on me
<U+202D>  To be the absolute king, and reign as free,
<U+202D>  As did my father, over all his hand
<U+202D>  Left here in this house slaves to my command.
<U+202D>     Eurymachus, the son of Polybus,
<U+202D>  To this made this reply:  Telemachus!
<U+202D>  The girlond of this kingdom let the knees
<U+202D>  Of Deity run for; but the faculties
<U+202D>  This house is seisd of, and the turrets here,
<U+202D>  Thou shalt be lord of, nor shall any bear
<U+202D>  The least part off of all thou dost possess,
<U+202D>  As long as this land is no wilderness.
<U+202D>  Nor ruld by out-laws.  But give these their pass,
<U+202D>  And tell me, best of princes, who he was
<U+202D>  That guested here so late?  From whence?  And what
<U+202D>  In any region boasted he his state?
<U+202D>  His race?  His country?  Brought he any news
<U+202D>  Of thy returning father?  Or for dues
<U+202D>  Of moneys to him made he fit repair?
<U+202D>  How suddenly he rushd into the air,
<U+202D>  Nor would sustain to stay and make him known!
<U+202D>  His port showd no debauchd companion.
<U+202D>     He answerd:  The return of my lovd sire
<U+202D>  Is past all hope; and should rude Fame inspire
<U+202D>  From any place a flattring messenger
<U+202D>  With news of his survival, he should bear
<U+202D>  No least belief off from my desprate love.
<U+202D>  Which if a sacred prophet should approve,
<U+202D>  Calld by my mother for her cares unrest,
<U+202D>  It should not move me.  For my late fair guest,
<U+202D>  He was of old my fathers, touching here
<U+202D>  From sea-girt Taphos; and for name doth bear
<U+202D>  Mentas, the son of wise Anchialus;
<U+202D>  And governs all the Taphians studious
<U+202D>  Of navigation.  This he said, but knew
<U+202D>  It was a Goddess.  These again withdrew
<U+202D>  To dances and attraction of the song;
<U+202D>  And while their pleasures did the time prolong,
<U+202D>  The sable Even descended, and did steep
<U+202D>  The lids of all men in desire of sleep.
<U+202D>     Telemachus, into a room built high,
<U+202D>  Of his illustrious court, and to the eye
<U+202D>  Of circular prospect, to his bed ascended,
<U+202D>  And in his mind much weighty thought contended
<U+202D>  Before him Euryclea (that well knew
<U+202D>  All the observance of a handmaids due,
<U+202D>  Daughter to Opis Pisenorides)
<U+202D>  Bore two bright torches; who did so much please
<U+202D>  Laërtes in her prime, that, for the price
<U+202D>  Of twenty oxen, he made merchandise
<U+202D>  Of her rare beauties; and loves equal flame,
<U+202D>  To her he felt, as to his nuptial dame,
<U+202D>  Yet never durst he mix with her in bed,
<U+202D>  So much the anger of his wife he fled.
<U+202D>  She, now grown old, to young Telemachus
<U+202D>  Two torches bore, and was obsequious
<U+202D>  Past all his other maids, and did apply
<U+202D>  Her service to him from his infancy.
<U+202D>  His well-built chamber reachd, she opd the door,
<U+202D>  He on his bed sat, the soft weeds he wore
<U+202D>  Put off, and to the diligent old maid
<U+202D>  Gave all; who fitly all in thick folds laid,
<U+202D>  And hung them on a beam-pin near the bed,
<U+202D>  That round about was rich embroidered.
<U+202D>  Then made she haste forth from him, and did bring
<U+202D>  The door together with a silver ring,
<U+202D>  And by a string a bar to it did pull.
<U+202D>  He, laid, and coverd well with curled wool
<U+202D>  Wovn in silk quilts, all night employd his mind
<U+202D>  About the task that Pallas had designd.
