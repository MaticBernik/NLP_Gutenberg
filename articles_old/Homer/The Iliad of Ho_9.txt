   [Footnote 70: "The gods formed a sort of political community of
   their own, which had its hierarchy, its distribution of ranks and

But when the splendid light of the sun was sunk, they retired to repose,
each one to his home, where renowned Vulcan, lame of both legs, with
cunning skill had built a house for each. But the Olympian thunderer
Jove went to his couch, where he lay before, when sweet sleep came upon
him. There, having ascended, he lay down to rest, and beside him
golden-throned Juno.

                              ARGUMENT.
Jove sends a dream to Agamemnon, in consequence of which he re-assembles
the army. Thersites is punished for his insolent speech, and the troops
are restrained from seeking a return homewards. The catalogue of the
ships and the forces of the confederates follows.
The rest, then, both gods and horse-arraying men,[71] slept all the
night: but Jove sweet sleep possessed not; but he was pondering in his
mind how he might honour Achilles, and destroy many at the ships of the
Greeks. But this device appeared best to him in his mind, to send a
fatal dream[72] to Agamemnon, the son of Atreus. And addressing him, he
spoke winged words:
"Haste away, pernicious dream, to the swift ships of the Greeks. Going
into the tent of Agamemnon, son of Atreus, utter very accurately
everything as I shall command thee. Bid him arm the long-haired
Achaeans[73] with all their array; for now perhaps he may[74] take the
wide-wayed city of the Trojans; for the immortals who possess the
Olympian mansions no longer think dividedly, for Juno, supplicating,
hath bent all [to her will]. And woes are impending over the Trojans."
Thus he spake: and the dream[75] accordingly departed, as soon as it
heard the mandate. And quickly it came to the swift ships of the Greeks,
and went unto Agamemnon, the son of Atreus. But him it found sleeping in
his tent, and ambrosial slumber was diffused around. And he stood over
his head, like unto Nestor, the son of Neleus, him, to wit, whom
Agamemnon honoured most of the old men. To him assimilating himself, the
divine dream addressed him:

   horseback was not practised in the Homeric times."]
   [Footnote 72: Some would personify Oneirus, as god of dreams.]
   [Footnote 73: Observe the distinction, for the Abantes, ver. 542,
   and the Thracians, iv. 533, wore their hair differently.]
   [Footnote 74: [Greek: ken] limits the assertion to _probability_,
   so that Jupiter does not utter a _direct_ falsehood.]
   [Footnote 75: In defence of this cheating conduct of Jove, at
   which Plato was much scandalized, Coleridge, p. 154, observes:
   "The [Greek: oulos oneiros] was a lying spirit, which the father
   of gods and men had a supreme right to commission for the purpose
   of working out his ultimate will."]
