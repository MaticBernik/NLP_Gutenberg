BOOK XVI
ARGUMENT
Telemachus dispatches Eumaeus to the city to inform Penelope of his safe
return from Pylus; during his absence, Ulysses makes himself known to his
son. The suitors, having watched for Telemachus in vain, arrive again at
Ithaca.
    It was the hour of dawn, when in the cot
    Kindling fresh fire, Ulysses and his friend
    Noble Eumaeus dress'd their morning fare,
    And sent the herdsmen with the swine abroad.
    Seeing Telemachus, the watchful dogs
    Bark'd not, but fawn'd around him. At that sight,
    And at the sound of feet which now approach'd,
    Ulysses in wing'd accents thus remark'd.
      Eumaeus! certain, either friend of thine
    Is nigh at hand, or one whom well thou know'st;                   10
    Thy dogs bark not, but fawn on his approach
    Obsequious, and the sound of feet I hear.
      Scarce had he ceased, when his own son himself
    Stood in the vestibule. Upsprang at once
    Eumaeus wonder-struck, and from his hand
    Let fall the cups with which he was employ'd
    Mingling rich wine; to his young Lord he ran,
    His forehead kiss'd, kiss'd his bright-beaming eyes
    And both his hands, weeping profuse the while,
    As when a father folds in his embrace                             20
    Arrived from foreign lands in the tenth year
    His darling son, the offspring of his age,
    His only one, for whom he long hath mourn'd,
    So kiss'd the noble peasant o'er and o'er
    Godlike Telemachus, as from death escaped,
    And in wing'd accents plaintive thus began.
      Light of my eyes, thou com'st; it is thyself,
    Sweetest Telemachus! I had no hope
    To see thee more, once told that o'er the Deep
    Thou hadst departed for the Pylian coast.                         30
    Enter, my precious son; that I may sooth
    My soul with sight of thee from far arrived,
    For seldom thou thy feeders and thy farm
    Visitest, in the city custom'd much
    To make abode, that thou may'st witness there
    The manners of those hungry suitors proud.
      To whom Telemachus, discrete, replied.
    It will be so. There is great need, my friend!
    But here, for thy sake, have I now arrived,
    That I may look on thee, and from thy lips                        40
    Learn if my mother still reside at home,
    Or have become spouse of some other Chief,
    Leaving untenanted Ulysses' bed
    To be by noisome spiders webb'd around.
      To whom the master swine-herd in return.
    Not so, she, patient still as ever, dwells
    Beneath thy roof, but all her cheerless days
    Despairing wastes, and all her nights in tears.
      So saying, Eumaeus at his hand received
    His brazen lance, and o'er the step of stone                      50
    Enter'd Telemachus, to whom his sire
    Relinquish'd, soon as he appear'd, his seat,
    But him Telemachus forbidding, said--
      Guest, keep thy seat; our cottage will afford
    Some other, which Eumaeus will provide.
      He ceased, and he, returning at the word,
    Reposed again; then good Eumaeus spread
    Green twigs beneath, which, cover'd with a fleece,
    Supplied Ulysses' offspring with a seat.
    He, next, disposed his dishes on the board                        60
    With relicts charged of yesterday; with bread,
    Alert, he heap'd the baskets; with rich wine
    His ivy cup replenish'd; and a seat
    Took opposite to his illustrious Lord
    Ulysses. They toward the plenteous feast
    Stretch'd forth their hands, (and hunger now and thirst
    Both satisfied) Telemachus, his speech
    Addressing to their gen'rous host, began.
      Whence is this guest, my father? How convey'd
    Came he to Ithaca? What country boast                             70
    The mariners with whom he here arrived?
    For, that on foot he found us not, is sure.
      To whom Eumaeus, thou didst thus reply.
    I will with truth answer thee, O my son!
    He boasts him sprung from ancestry renown'd
    In spacious Crete, and hath the cities seen
    Of various lands, by fate ordain'd to roam.
    Ev'n now, from a Thesprotian ship escaped,
    He reach'd my cottage--but he is thy own;
    I yield him to thee; treat him as thou wilt;                      80
    He is thy suppliant, and depends on thee.
      Then thus, Telemachus, discrete, replied.
    Thy words, Eumaeus, pain my very soul.
    For what security can I afford
    To any in my house? myself am young,
    Nor yet of strength sufficient to repel
    An offer'd insult, and my mother's mind
    In doubtful balance hangs, if, still with me
    An inmate, she shall manage my concerns,
    Attentive only to her absent Lord                                 90
    And her own good report, or shall espouse
    The noblest of her wooers, and the best
    Entitled by the splendour of his gifts.
    But I will give him, since I find him lodg'd
    A guest beneath thy roof, tunic and cloak,
    Sword double-edged, and sandals for his feet,
    With convoy to the country of his choice.
    Still, if it please thee, keep him here thy guest,
    And I will send him raiment, with supplies
    Of all sorts, lest he burthen thee and thine.                    100
    But where the suitors come, there shall not he
    With my consent, nor stand exposed to pride
    And petulance like theirs, lest by some sneer
    They wound him, and through him, wound also me;
    For little is it that the boldest can
    Against so many; numbers will prevail.
      Him answer'd then Ulysses toil-inured.
    Oh amiable and good! since even I
    Am free to answer thee, I will avow
    My heart within me torn by what I hear                           110
    Of those injurious suitors, who the house
    Infest of one noble as thou appear'st.
    But say--submittest thou to their controul
    Willingly, or because the people, sway'd
    By some response oracular, incline
    Against thee? Thou hast brothers, it may chance,
    Slow to assist thee--for a brother's aid
    Is of importance in whatever cause.
    For oh that I had youth as I have will,
    Or that renown'd Ulysses were my sire,                           120
    Or that himself might wander home again.
    Whereof hope yet remains! then might I lose
    My head, that moment, by an alien's hand,
    If I would fail, ent'ring Ulysses' gate,
    To be the bane and mischief of them all.
    But if alone to multitudes opposed
    I should perchance be foiled; nobler it were
    With my own people, under my own roof
    To perish, than to witness evermore
    Their unexampled deeds, guests shoved aside,                     130
    Maidens dragg'd forcibly from room to room,
    Casks emptied of their rich contents, and them
    Indulging glutt'nous appetite day by day
    Enormous, without measure, without end.
      To whom, Telemachus, discrete, replied.
    Stranger! thy questions shall from me receive
    True answer. Enmity or hatred none
    Subsists the people and myself between,
    Nor have I brothers to accuse, whose aid
    Is of importance in whatever cause,                              140
    For Jove hath from of old with single heirs
    Our house supplied; Arcesias none begat
    Except Laertes, and Laertes none
    Except Ulysses, and Ulysses me
    Left here his only one, and unenjoy'd.
    Thence comes it that our palace swarms with foes;
    For all the rulers of the neighbour isles,
    Samos, Dulichium, and the forest-crown'd
    Zacynthus, others also rulers here
    In craggy Ithaca, my mother seek                                 150
    In marriage, and my household stores consume.
    But neither she those nuptial rites abhorr'd
    Refuses absolute, nor yet consents
    To end them; they my patrimony waste
    Meantime, and will destroy me also soon,
    As I expect, but heav'n disposes all.
      Eumaeus! haste, my father! bear with speed
    News to Penelope that I am safe,
    And have arrived from Pylus; I will wait
    Till thou return; and well beware that none
    Hear thee beside, for I have many foes.
      To whom Eumaeus, thou didst thus reply.
    It is enough. I understand. Thou speak'st
    To one intelligent. But say beside,
    Shall I not also, as I go, inform
    Distress'd Laertes? who while yet he mourn'd
    Ulysses only, could o'ersee the works,
    And dieted among his menials oft
    As hunger prompted him, but now, they say,
    Since thy departure to the Pylian shore,                         170
    He neither eats as he was wont, nor drinks,
    Nor oversees his hinds, but sighing sits
    And weeping, wasted even to the bone.
      Him then Telemachus answer'd discrete.
    Hard though it be, yet to his tears and sighs
    Him leave we now. We cannot what we would.
    For, were the ordering of all events
    Referr'd to our own choice, our first desire
    Should be to see my father's glad return.
    But once thy tidings told, wander not thou                       180
    In quest of Him, but hither speed again.
    Rather request my mother that she send
    Her household's governess without delay
    Privately to him; she shall best inform
    The ancient King that I have safe arrived.
      He said, and urged him forth, who binding on
    His sandals, to the city bent his way.
    Nor went Eumaeus from his home unmark'd
    By Pallas, who in semblance of a fair
    Damsel, accomplish'd in domestic arts,                           190
    Approaching to the cottage' entrance, stood
    Opposite, by Ulysses plain discern'd,
    But to his son invisible; for the Gods
    Appear not manifest alike to all.
    The mastiffs saw her also, and with tone
    Querulous hid themselves, yet bark'd they not.
    She beckon'd him abroad. Ulysses saw
    The sign, and, issuing through the outer court,
    Approach'd her, whom the Goddess thus bespake.
      Laertes' progeny, for wiles renown'd!                          200
    Disclose thyself to thy own son, that, death
    Concerting and destruction to your foes,
    Ye may the royal city seek, nor long
    Shall ye my presence there desire in vain,
    For I am ardent to begin the fight.
      Minerva spake, and with her rod of gold
    Touch'd him; his mantle, first, and vest she made
    Pure as new-blanch'd; dilating, next, his form,
    She gave dimensions ampler to his limbs;
    Swarthy again his manly hue became,                              210
    Round his full face, and black his bushy chin.
    The change perform'd, Minerva disappear'd,
    And the illustrious Hero turn'd again
    Into the cottage; wonder at that sight
    Seiz'd on Telemachus; askance he look'd,
    Awe-struck, not unsuspicious of a God,
    And in wing'd accents eager thus began.
      Thou art no longer, whom I lately saw,
    Nor are thy cloaths, nor is thy port the same.
    Thou art a God, I know, and dwell'st in heav'n.                  220
    Oh, smile on us, that we may yield thee rites
    Acceptable, and present thee golden gifts
    Elaborate; ah spare us, Pow'r divine!
      To whom Ulysses, Hero toil-inured.
    I am no God. Why deem'st thou me divine?
    I am thy father, for whose sake thou lead'st
    A life of woe, by violence oppress'd.
      So saying, he kiss'd his son, while from his cheeks
    Tears trickled, tears till then, perforce restrained.
    Telemachus, (for he believed him not                             230
    His father yet) thus, wond'ring, spake again.
      My father, said'st thou? no. Thou art not He,
    But some Divinity beguiles my soul
    With mock'ries to afflict me still the more;
    For never mortal man could so have wrought
    By his own pow'r; some interposing God
    Alone could render thee both young and old,
    For old thou wast of late, and foully clad,
    But wear'st the semblance, now, of those in heav'n!
      To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied.                           240
    Telemachus! it is not well, my son!
    That thou should'st greet thy father with a face
    Of wild astonishment, and stand aghast.
    Ulysses, save myself, none comes, be sure.
    Such as thou seest, after ten thousand woes
    Which I have borne, I visit once again
    My native country in the twentieth year.
    This wonder Athenaean Pallas wrought,
    She cloath'd me even with what form she would,
    For so she can. Now poor I seem and old,                         250
    Now young again, and clad in fresh attire.
    The Gods who dwell in yonder heav'n, with ease
    Dignify or debase a mortal man.
      So saying, he sat. Then threw Telemachus
    His arms around his father's neck, and wept.
    Desire intense of lamentation seized
    On both; soft murmurs utt'ring, each indulged
    His grief, more frequent wailing than the bird,
    (Eagle, or hook-nail'd vulture) from whose nest
    Some swain hath stol'n her yet unfeather'd young.                260
    So from their eyelids they big drops distill'd
    Of tend'rest grief, nor had the setting sun
    Cessation of their weeping seen, had not
    Telemachus his father thus address'd.
      What ship convey'd thee to thy native shore,
    My father! and what country boast the crew?
    For, that on foot thou not arriv'dst, is sure.
      Then thus divine Ulysses toil-inured.
    My son! I will explicit all relate.
    Conducted by Phaeacia's maritime sons                             270
    I came, a race accustom'd to convey
    Strangers who visit them across the Deep.
    Me, o'er the billows in a rapid bark
    Borne sleeping, on the shores of Ithaca
    They lay'd; rich gifts they gave me also, brass,
    Gold in full bags, and beautiful attire,
    Which, warn'd from heav'n, I have in caves conceal'd.
    By Pallas prompted, hither I repair'd
    That we might plan the slaughter of our foes,
    Whose numbers tell me now, that I may know                       280
    How pow'rful, certainly, and who they are,
    And consultation with my dauntless heart
    May hold, if we be able to contend
    Ourselves with all, or must have aid beside.
      Then, answer thus his son, discrete, return'd.
    My father! thy renown hath ever rung
    In thy son's ears, and by report thy force
    In arms, and wisdom I have oft been told.
    But terribly thou speak'st; amazement-fixt
    I hear; can two a multitude oppose,                              290
    And valiant warriors all? for neither ten
    Are they, nor twenty, but more num'rous far.
    Learn, now, their numbers. Fifty youths and two
    Came from Dulichium; they are chosen men,
    And six attendants follow in their train;
    From Samos twenty youths and four arrive,
    Zacynthus also of Achaia's sons
    Sends twenty more, and our own island adds,
    Herself, her twelve chief rulers; Medon, too,
    Is there the herald, and the bard divine,                        300
    With other two, intendants of the board.
    Should we within the palace, we alone,
    Assail them all, I fear lest thy revenge
    Unpleasant to thyself and deadly prove,
    Frustrating thy return. But recollect--
    Think, if thou canst, on whose confed'rate arm
    Strenuous on our behalf we may rely.
      To him replied his patient father bold.
    I will inform thee. Mark. Weigh well my words.
    Will Pallas and the everlasting Sire                             310
    Alone suffice? or need we other aids?
      Then answer thus Telemachus return'd.
    Good friends indeed are they whom thou hast named,
    Though throned above the clouds; for their controul
    Is universal both in earth and heav'n.
      To whom Ulysses, toil-worn Chief renown'd.
    Not long will they from battle stand aloof,
    When once, within my palace, in the strength
    Of Mars, to sharp decision we shall urge
    The suitors. But thyself at early dawn                           320
    Our mansion seek, that thou may'st mingle there
    With that imperious throng; me in due time
    Eumaeus to the city shall conduct,
    In form a miserable beggar old.
    But should they with dishonourable scorn
    Insult me, thou unmov'd my wrongs endure,
    And should they even drag me by the feet
    Abroad, or smite me with the spear, thy wrath
    Refraining, gently counsel them to cease
    From such extravagance; but well I know                          330
    That cease they will not, for their hour is come.
    And mark me well; treasure what now I say
    Deep in thy soul. When Pallas shall, herself,
    Suggest the measure, then, shaking my brows,
    I will admonish thee; thou, at the sign,
    Remove what arms soever in the hall
    Remain, and in the upper palace safe
    Dispose them; should the suitors, missing them,
    Perchance interrogate thee, then reply
    Gently--I have removed them from the smoke;                      340
    For they appear no more the arms which erst
    Ulysses, going hence to Ilium, left,
    But smirch'd and sullied by the breath of fire.
    This weightier reason (thou shalt also say)
    Jove taught me; lest, intoxicate with wine,
    Ye should assault each other in your brawls,
    Shaming both feast and courtship; for the view
    Itself of arms incites to their abuse.
    Yet leave two faulchions for ourselves alone,
    Two spears, two bucklers, which with sudden force                350
    Impetuous we will seize, and Jove all-wise
    Their valour shall, and Pallas, steal away.
    This word store also in remembrance deep--
    If mine in truth thou art, and of my blood,
    Then, of Ulysses to his home returned
    Let none hear news from thee, no, not my sire
    Laertes, nor Eumaeus, nor of all
    The menials any, or ev'n Penelope,
    That thou and I, alone, may search the drift
    Of our domestic women, and may prove                             360
    Our serving-men, who honours and reveres
    And who contemns us both, but chiefly thee
    So gracious and so worthy to be loved.
      Him then thus answer'd his illustrious son.
    Trust me, my father! thou shalt soon be taught
    That I am not of drowsy mind obtuse.
    But this I think not likely to avail
    Or thee or me; ponder it yet again;
    For tedious were the task, farm after farm
    To visit of those servants, proving each,                        370
    And the proud suitors merciless devour
    Meantime thy substance, nor abstain from aught.
    Learn, if thou wilt, (and I that course myself
    Advise) who slights thee of the female train,
    And who is guiltless; but I would not try
    From house to house the men, far better proved
    Hereafter, if in truth by signs from heav'n
    Inform'd, thou hast been taught the will of Jove.
      Thus they conferr'd. The gallant bark, meantime,
    Reach'd Ithaca, which from the Pylian shore                      380
    Had brought Telemachus with all his band.
    Within the many-fathom'd port arrived
    His lusty followers haled her far aground,
    Then carried thence their arms, but to the house
    Of Clytius the illustrious gifts convey'd.
    Next to the royal mansion they dispatch'd
    An herald charg'd with tidings to the Queen,
    That her Telemachus had reach'd the cot
    Of good Eumaeus, and the bark had sent
    Home to the city; lest the matchless dame                        390
    Should still deplore the absence of her son.
    They, then, the herald and the swine-herd, each
    Bearing like message to his mistress, met,
    And at the palace of the godlike Chief
    Arriving, compass'd by the female throng
    Inquisitive, the herald thus began.
      Thy son, O Queen! is safe; ev'n now return'd.
    Then, drawing nigh to her, Eumaeus told
    His message also from her son received,
    And, his commission punctually discharged,                       400
    Leaving the palace, sought his home again.
      Grief seized and anguish, at those tidings, all
    The suitors; issuing forth, on the outside
    Of the high wall they sat, before the gate,
    When Polybus' son, Eurymachus, began.
      My friends! his arduous task, this voyage, deem'd
    By us impossible, in our despight
    Telemachus hath atchieved. Haste! launch we forth
    A sable bark, our best, which let us man
    With mariners expert, who, rowing forth                          410
    Swiftly, shall summon our companions home.
      Scarce had he said, when turning where he sat,
    Amphinomus beheld a bark arrived
    Just then in port; he saw them furling sail,
    And seated with their oars in hand; he laugh'd
    Through pleasure at that sight, and thus he spake.
      Our message may be spared. Lo! they arrive.
    Either some God inform'd them, or they saw,
    Themselves, the vessel of Telemachus
    Too swiftly passing to be reach'd by theirs.                     420
      He spake; they, rising, hasted to the shore.
    Alert they drew the sable bark aground,
    And by his servant each his arms dispatch'd
    To his own home. Then, all, to council those
    Assembling, neither elder of the land
    Nor youth allow'd to join them, and the rest
    Eupithes' son, Antinoues, thus bespake.
      Ah! how the Gods have rescued him! all day
    Perch'd on the airy mountain-top, our spies
    Successive watch'd; and, when the sun declined,                  430
    We never slept on shore, but all night long
    Till sacred dawn arose, plow'd the abyss,
    Hoping Telemachus, that we might seize
    And slay him, whom some Deity hath led,
    In our despight, safe to his home again.
    But frame we yet again means to destroy
    Telemachus; ah--let not Him escape!
    For end of this our task, while he survives,
    None shall be found, such prudence he displays
    And wisdom, neither are the people now                           440
    Unanimous our friends as heretofore.
    Come, then--prevent him, ere he call the Greeks
    To council; for he will not long delay,
    But will be angry, doubtless, and will tell
    Amid them all, how we in vain devised
    His death, a deed which they will scarce applaud,
    But will, perhaps, punish and drive us forth
    From our own country to a distant land.--
    Prevent him, therefore, quickly; in the field
    Slay him, or on the road; so shall his wealth                    450
    And his possessions on ourselves devolve
    Which we will share equally, but his house
    Shall be the Queen's, and his whom she shall wed.
    Yet, if not so inclined, ye rather chuse
    That he should live and occupy entire
    His patrimony, then, no longer, here
    Assembled, let us revel at his cost,
    But let us all with spousal gifts produced
    From our respective treasures, woo the Queen,
    Leaving her in full freedom to espouse                           460
    Who proffers most, and whom the fates ordain.
      He ceased; the assembly silent sat and mute.
    Then rose Amphinomus amid them all,
    Offspring renown'd of Nisus, son, himself,
    Of King Aretias. He had thither led
    The suitor train who from the pleasant isle
    Corn-clad of green Dulichium had arrived,
    And by his speech pleased far beyond them all
    Penelope, for he was just and wise,
    And thus, well-counselling the rest, began.                      470
      Not I, my friends! far be the thought from me
    To slay Telemachus! it were a deed
    Momentous, terrible, to slay a prince.
    First, therefore, let us counsel ask of heav'n,
    And if Jove's oracle that course approve,
    I will encourage you, and will myself
    Be active in his death; but if the Gods
    Forbid it, then, by my advice, forbear.
      So spake Amphinomus, whom all approved.
    Arising then, into Ulysses' house                                480
    They went, where each his splendid seat resumed.
      A novel purpose occupied, meantime,
    Penelope; she purposed to appear
    Before her suitors, whose design to slay
    Telemachus she had from Medon learn'd,
    The herald, for his ear had caught the sound.
    Toward the hall with her attendant train
    She moved, and when, most graceful of her sex,
    Where sat the suitors she arrived, between
    The columns standing of the stately dome,                        490
    And covering with her white veil's lucid folds
    Her features, to Antinoues thus she spake.
      Antinoues, proud, contentious, evermore
    To mischief prone! the people deem thee wise
    Past thy compeers, and in all grace of speech
    Pre-eminent, but such wast never thou.
    Inhuman! why is it thy dark design
    To slay Telemachus? and why with scorn
    Rejectest thou the suppliant's pray'r,[72] which Jove
    Himself hath witness'd? Plots please not the Gods.               500
    Know'st not that thy own father refuge found
    Here, when he fled before the people's wrath
    Whom he had irritated by a wrong
    Which, with a band of Taphian robbers joined,
    He offer'd to the Thesprots, our allies?
    They would have torn his heart, and would have laid
    All his delights and his possessions waste,
    But my Ulysses slaked the furious heat
    Of their revenge, whom thou requitest now
    Wasting his goods, soliciting his wife,                          510
    Slaying his son, and filling me with woe.
    But cease, I charge thee, and bid cease the rest.
      To whom the son of Polybus replied,
    Eurymachus.--Icarius' daughter wise!
    Take courage, fair Penelope, and chace
    These fears unreasonable from thy mind!
    The man lives not, nor shall, who while I live,
    And faculty of sight retain, shall harm
    Telemachus, thy son. For thus I say,
    And thus will I perform; his blood shall stream                  520
    A sable current from my lance's point
    That moment; for the city-waster Chief
    Ulysses, oft, me placing on his knees,
    Hath fill'd my infant grasp with sav'ry food,
    And giv'n me ruddy wine. I, therefore, hold
    Telemachus of all men most my friend,
    Nor hath he death to fear from hand of ours.
    Yet, if the Gods shall doom him, die he must.
      So he encouraged her, who yet, himself,
    Plotted his death. She, re-ascending, sought                     530
    Her stately chamber, and, arriving there,
    Deplored with tears her long-regretted Lord
    Till Athenaean Pallas azure-eyed
    Dews of soft slumber o'er her lids diffused.
      And now, at even-tide, Eumaeus reach'd
    Ulysses and his son. A yearling swine
    Just slain they skilfully for food prepared,
    When Pallas, drawing nigh, smote with her wand
    Ulysses, at the stroke rend'ring him old,
    And his apparel sordid as before,                                540
    Lest, knowing him, the swain at once should seek
    Penelope, and let the secret forth.
      Then foremost him Telemachus address'd.
    Noble Eumaeus! thou art come; what news
    Bring'st from the city? Have the warrior band
    Of suitors, hopeless of their ambush, reach'd
    The port again, or wait they still for me?
      To whom Eumaeus, thou didst thus reply.
    No time for such enquiry, nor to range,
    Curious, the streets had I, but anxious wish'd                   550
    To make my message known, and to return.
    But, as it chanced, a nimble herald sent
    From thy companions, met me on the way,
    Who reach'd thy mother first. Yet this I know,
    For this I saw. Passing above the town
    Where they have piled a way-side hill of stones
    To Mercury, I beheld a gallant bark
    Ent'ring the port; a bark she was of ours,
    The crew were num'rous, and I mark'd her deep-
    Laden with shields and spears of double edge.                    560
    Theirs I conjectured her, and could no more.
      He spake, and by Eumaeus unperceived,
    Telemachus his father eyed and smiled.
    Their task accomplish'd, and the table spread,
    They ate, nor any his due portion miss'd,
    And hunger, now, and thirst both sated, all
    To rest repair'd, and took the gift of sleep.
