Upon this severity, one of the seamen, bolder than the rest, but still
with all possible respect to the captain, besought his honour, as he
called him, that he would give leave to some more of them to go on
shore, and die with their companions, or, if possible, to assist them
to resist the barbarians. The captain, rather provoked than cowed with
this, came to the barricade of the quarter-deck, and speaking very
prudently to the men (for had he spoken roughly, two-thirds of them
would have left the ship, if not all of them), he told them, it was
for their safety as well as his own that he had been obliged to that
severity; that mutiny on board a ship was the same thing as treason in a
king's palace, and he could not answer it to his owners and employers
to trust the ship and goods committed to his charge with men who had
entertained thoughts of the worst and blackest nature; that he wished
heartily that it had been anywhere else that they had been set on shore,
where they might have been in less hazard from the savages; that, if he
had designed they should be destroyed, he could as well have executed
them on board as the other two; that he wished it had been in some other
part of the world, where he might have delivered them up to the civil
justice, or might have left them among Christians; but it was better
their lives were put in hazard than his life, and the safety of the
ship; and that though he did not know that he had deserved so ill of any
of them as that they should leave the ship rather than do their duty,
yet if any of them were resolved to do so unless he would consent to
take a gang of traitors on board, who, as he had proved before them
all, had conspired to murder him, he would not hinder them, nor for the
present would he resent their importunity; but, if there was nobody left
in the ship but himself, he would never consent to take them on board.
This discourse was delivered so well, was in itself so reasonable, was
managed with so much temper, yet so boldly concluded with a negative,
that the greatest part of the men were satisfied for the present.
However, as it put the men into juntos and cabals, they were not
composed for some hours; the wind also slackening towards night, the
captain ordered not to weigh till next morning.
The same night twenty-three of the men, among whom was the gunner's
mate, the surgeon's assistant, and two carpenters, applying to the chief
mate told him, that as the captain had given them leave to go on shore
to their comrades, they begged that he would speak to the captain not to
take it ill that they were desirous to go and die with their companions;
and that they thought they could do no less in such an extremity than
go to them; because, if there was any way to save their lives, it was
by adding to their numbers, and making them strong enough to assist one
another in defending themselves against the savages, till perhaps they
might one time or other find means to make their escape, and get to
their own country again.
