HEDDA.
[Receives her warmly.] How do you do, my dear Mrs. Elvsted? It's
delightful to see you again.
MRS. ELVSTED.
[Nervously, struggling for self-control.] Yes, it's a very long time
since we met.
TESMAN.
[Gives her his hand.] And we too--eh?
HEDDA.
Thanks for your lovely flowers--
MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh, not at all--. I would have come straight here yesterday afternoon;
but I heard that you were away--
TESMAN.
Have you just come to town? Eh?
MRS. ELVSTED.
I arrived yesterday, about midday. Oh, I was quite in despair when I
heard that you were not at home.
HEDDA.
In despair! How so?
TESMAN.
Why, my dear Mrs. Rysing--I mean Mrs. Elvsted--
HEDDA.
I hope that you are not in any trouble?
MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes, I am. And I don't know another living creature here that I can turn
to.
HEDDA.
[Laying the bouquet on the table.] Come--let us sit here on the sofa--
MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh, I am too restless to sit down.
HEDDA.
Oh no, you're not. Come here.
     [She draws MRS. ELVSTED down upon the sofa and sits at her side.
TESMAN.
Well? What is it, Mrs. Elvsted--?
HEDDA.
Has anything particular happened to you at home?
MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes--and no. Oh--I am so anxious you should not misunderstand me--
HEDDA.
Then your best plan is to tell us the whole story, Mrs. Elvsted.
TESMAN.
I suppose that's what you have come for--eh?
MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes, yes--of course it is. Well then, I must tell you--if you don't
already know--that Eilert Lovborg is in town, too.
HEDDA.
Lovborg--!
TESMAN.
What! Has Eilert Lovborg come back? Fancy that, Hedda!
HEDDA.
Well well--I hear it.
MRS. ELVSTED.
He has been here a week already. Just fancy--a whole week! In this
terrible town, alone! With so many temptations on all sides.
HEDDA.
But, my dear Mrs. Elvsted--how does he concern you so much?
MRS. ELVSTED.
[Looks at her with a startled air, and says rapidly.] He was the
children's tutor.
HEDDA.
Your children's?
MRS. ELVSTED.
My husband's. I have none.
HEDDA.
Your step-children's, then?
MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes.
TESMAN.
[Somewhat hesitatingly.] Then was he--I don't know how to express
it--was he--regular enough in his habits to be fit for the post? Eh?
MRS. ELVSTED.
For the last two years his conduct has been irreproachable.
TESMAN.
Has it indeed? Fancy that, Hedda!
HEDDA.
I hear it.
MRS. ELVSTED.
Perfectly irreproachable, I assure you! In every respect. But all the
same--now that I know he is here--in this great town--and with a large
sum of money in his hands--I can't help being in mortal fear for him.
TESMAN.
Why did he not remain where he was? With you and your husband? Eh?
MRS. ELVSTED.
After his book was published he was too restless and unsettled to remain
with us.
TESMAN.
Yes, by-the-bye, Aunt Julia told me he had published a new book.
MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes, a big book, dealing with the march of civilisation--in broad
outline, as it were. It came out about a fortnight ago. And since it has
sold so well, and been so much read--and made such a sensation--
