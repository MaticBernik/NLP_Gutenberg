Y.M. I do it every day. I cannot help it, now that I have gotten
started upon the degrading and exasperating quest. For it is hatefully
interesting!--in fact, fascinating is the word. As soon as I come across
a golden deed in a book I have to stop and take it apart and examine it,
I cannot help myself.
O.M. Have you ever found one that defeated the rule?
Y.M. No--at least, not yet. But take the case of servant--tipping in
Europe. You pay the _hotel_ for service; you owe the servants _nothing_,
yet you pay them besides. Doesn't that defeat it?
O.M. In what way?
Y.M. You are not _obliged_ to do it, therefore its source is compassion
for their ill-paid condition, and--
O.M. Has that custom ever vexed you, annoyed you, irritated you?
Y.M. Well, yes.
O.M. Still you succumbed to it?
Y.M. Of course.
O.M. Why of course?
Y.M. Well, custom is law, in a way, and laws must be submitted
to--everybody recognizes it as a _duty_.
O.M. Then you pay for the irritating tax for _duty's_ sake?
Y.M. I suppose it amounts to that.
O.M. Then the impulse which moves you to submit to the tax is not _all_
compassion, charity, benevolence?
Y.M. Well--perhaps not.
O.M. Is _any_ of it?
Y.M. I--perhaps I was too hasty in locating its source.
O.M. Perhaps so. In case you ignored the custom would you get prompt and
effective service from the servants?
Y.M. Oh, hear yourself talk! Those European servants? Why, you wouldn't
get any at all, to speak of.
O.M. Couldn't _that_ work as an impulse to move you to pay the tax?
Y.M. I am not denying it.
O.M. Apparently, then, it is a case of for-duty's-sake with a little
self-interest added?
Y.M. Yes, it has the look of it. But here is a point: we pay that tax
knowing it to be unjust and an extortion; yet we go away with a pain at
the heart if we think we have been stingy with the poor fellows; and we
heartily wish we were back again, so that we could do the right thing,
and _more_ than the right thing, the _generous_ thing. I think it will
be difficult for you to find any thought of self in that impulse.
O.M. I wonder why you should think so. When you find service charged in
the _hotel_ bill does it annoy you?
Y.M. No.
O.M. Do you ever complain of the amount of it?
Y.M. No, it would not occur to me.
O.M. The _expense_, then, is not the annoying detail. It is a fixed
charge, and you pay it cheerfully, you pay it without a murmur. When you
came to pay the servants, how would you like it if each of the men and
maids had a fixed charge?
Y.M. Like it? I should rejoice!
O.M. Even if the fixed tax were a shade _more_ than you had been in the
habit of paying in the form of tips?
