HEDDA.
Yes, you are a friend indeed. But here stands Thea all impatience to be
off--so _au revoir_ Judge. I shall be back again presently.
   [Mutual salutations.  MRS. ELVSTED and HEDDA go out by the hall
       door.
BRACK.
Well,--is your wife tolerably satisfied--
TESMAN.
Yes, we can't thank you sufficiently. Of course she talks of a little
re-arrangement here and there; and one or two things are still wanting.
We shall have to buy some additional trifles.
BRACK.
Indeed!
TESMAN.
But we won't trouble you about these things. Hedda say she herself will
look after what is wanting.--Shan't we sit down? Eh?
BRACK.
Thanks, for a moment. [Seats himself beside the table.] There is
something I wanted to speak to about, my dear Tesman.
TESMAN.
Indeed? Ah, I understand! [Seating himself.] I suppose it's the serious
part of the frolic that is coming now. Eh?
BRACK.
Oh, the money question is not so very pressing; though, for that matter,
I wish we had gone a little more economically to work.
TESMAN.
But that would never have done, you know! Think of Hedda, my dear
fellow! You, who know her so well--! I couldn't possibly ask her to put
up with a shabby style of living!
BRACK.
No, no--that is just the difficulty.
TESMAN.
And then--fortunately--it can't be long before I receive my appointment.
BRACK.
Well, you see--such things are often apt to hang fire for a long time.
TESMAN.
Have you heard anything definite? Eh?
BRACK.
Nothing exactly definite--. [Interrupting himself.] But by-the-bye--I
have one piece of news for you.
TESMAN.
Well?
BRACK.
Your old friend, Eilert Lovborg, has returned to town.
TESMAN.
I know that already.
BRACK.
Indeed! How did you learn it?
TESMAN.
From that lady who went out with Hedda.
BRACK.
Really? What was her name? I didn't quite catch it.
TESMAN.
Mrs. Elvsted.
BRACK.
Aha--Sheriff Elvsted's wife? Of course--he has been living up in their
regions.
TESMAN.
And fancy--I'm delighted to hear that he is quite a reformed character.
BRACK.
So they say.
TESMAN.
And then he has published a new book--eh?
BRACK.
Yes, indeed he has.
TESMAN.
And I hear it has made some sensation!
BRACK.
Quite an unusual sensation.
TESMAN.
Fancy--isn't that good news! A man of such extraordinary talents--. I
felt so grieved to think that he had gone irretrievably to ruin.
BRACK.
That was what everybody thought.
TESMAN.
But I cannot imagine what he will take to now! How in the world will he
be able to make his living? Eh?
   [During the last words, HEDDA has entered by the hall door.
HEDDA.
[To BRACK, laughing with a touch of scorn.] Tesman is for ever worrying
about how people are to make their living.
TESMAN.
Well you see, dear--we were talking about poor Eilert Lovborg.
HEDDA.
[Glancing at him rapidly.] Oh, indeed? [Sets herself in the arm-chair
beside the stove and asks indifferently:] What is the matter with him?
TESMAN.
Well--no doubt he has run through all his property long ago; and he can
scarcely write a new book every year--eh? So I really can't see what is
to become of him.
