Such a fish is the sturgeon, which goes rooting along like a pig, and
indeed is often called pig-fish.  Pricked by the first hook it touches,
the sturgeon gives a startled leap and comes into contact with half a
dozen more hooks.  Then it threshes about wildly, until it receives hook
after hook in its soft flesh; and the hooks, straining from many
different angles, hold the luckless fish fast until it is drowned.
Because no sturgeon can pass through a Chinese line, the device is called
a trap in the fish laws; and because it bids fair to exterminate the
sturgeon, it is branded by the fish laws as illegal.  And such a line, we
were confident, Big Alec intended setting, in open and flagrant violation
of the law.
Several days passed after the visit of Big Alec, during which Charley and
I kept a sharp watch on him.  He towed his ark around the Solano Wharf
and into the big bight at Turners Shipyard.  The bight we knew to be
good ground for sturgeon, and there we felt sure the King of the Greeks
intended to begin operations.  The tide circled like a mill-race in and
out of this bight, and made it possible to raise, lower, or set a Chinese
line only at slack water.  So between the tides Charley and I made it a
point for one or the other of us to keep a lookout from the Solano Wharf.
On the fourth day I was lying in the sun behind the stringer-piece of the
wharf, when I saw a skiff leave the distant shore and pull out into the
bight.  In an instant the glasses were at my eyes and I was following
every movement of the skiff.  There were two men in it, and though it was
a good mile away, I made out one of them to be Big Alec; and ere the
skiff returned to shore I made out enough more to know that the Greek had
set his line.
Big Alec has a Chinese line out in the bight off Turners Shipyard,
Charley Le Grant said that afternoon to Carmintel.
A fleeting expression of annoyance passed over the patrolmans face, and
then he said, Yes? in an absent way, and that was all.
Charley bit his lip with suppressed anger and turned on his heel.
Are you game, my lad? he said to me later on in the evening, just as we
finished washing down the _Reindeers_ decks and were preparing to turn
in.
A lump came up in my throat, and I could only nod my head.
Well, then, and Charleys eyes glittered in a determined way, weve
got to capture Big Alec between us, you and I, and weve got to do it in
spite of Carmintel.  Will you lend a hand?
Its a hard proposition, but we can do it, he added after a pause.
Of course we can, I supplemented enthusiastically.
And then he said, Of course we can, and we shook hands on it and went
to bed.
