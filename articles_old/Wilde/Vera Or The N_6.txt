OMNES. Kill him! Kill him! (_draw their knives_.)
VERA (_rushing in front of ALEXIS_). Stand back, I say, Michael! Stand
back all! [30]Do not dare[30] lay a hand upon him! He is the noblest
heart amongst us.
OMNES. Kill him! Kill him! He is a spy!
VERA. Dare to lay a finger on him, and I leave you all to yourselves.
PRES. Vera, did you not hear what Michael said of him? He stayed all
night in the Czar's palace. He has a password and a private key. What
else should he be but a spy?
VERA. Bah! I do not believe Michael. It is a lie! It is[31] a lie!
Alexis, say it is a lie!
ALEX. It is true. Michael has told what he saw. I did pass that night in
the Czar's palace. Michael has spoken the truth.
VERA. Stand back, I say; stand back! Alexis, I do not care. I trust you;
you would not betray us; you would not sell the people for money. You
are honest, true! Oh, say you are no spy!
ALEX. Spy? You know I am not. I am with you, my brothers, to the death.
MICH. Ay, to your own death.
ALEX. Vera, you[32] know I am true.
VERA. I know it well.
PRES. Why are you here, traitor?
ALEX. Because I love the people.
MICH. Then you can be a martyr for them?
VERA. You must kill me first, Michael, before you lay a finger on him.
PRES. Michael, we dare not lose Vera. It is her whim to let this boy
live. We can keep him here to-night. Up to this he has not betrayed us.
(_Tramp of soldiers outside, knocking at door._)[33]
VOICE. Open in the name of the Emperor!
MICH. He _has_ betrayed us. This is your doing, spy!
PRES. Come, Michael, come. We have no time to cut one another's throats
while we have our own heads to save.
VOICE. Open in the name of the Emperor!
PRES. Brothers, be masked all of you. [34]Michael, open the door. It is
our only chance.[34]
(_Enter GENERAL KOTEMKIN and soldiers._)
GEN. All honest citizens should be in their own houses at an hour before
midnight, and not more than five people have a right to meet privately.
Have you not noticed the proclamation, fellows?
MICH. Ay, you have spoiled every honest[35] wall in Moscow with it.
VERA. Peace, Michael, peace. Nay, Sir, we knew it not. We are a company
of strolling players travelling from Samara to Moscow to amuse His
Imperial Majesty the Czar.
GEN. But I heard loud voices before I entered. What was that?
VERA. We were rehearsing a new tragedy.
GEN. Your answers are too _honest_ to be true. Come, let me see who you
are. Take off those players' masks. By St. Nicholas, my beauty, if your
face matches your figure, you must be a choice morsel! Come, I say,
pretty one; I would sooner see your face than those of all the others.
