PRESIDENT. What hour is it?
FIRST CONSP. The hour to strike.
PRES. What day?
SECOND CONSP. The day of Marat.[1]
PRES. In what month?
SECOND CONSP. The month of liberty.
PRES. What is our duty?
FOURTH CONSP. To obey.
PRES. Our creed?
FIFTH CONSP. Parbleu, Mons. le President, I never knew you had one.
CONSPS. A spy! A spy! Unmask! Unmask! A spy!
PRES. [2]Let the doors be shut. There are others but Nihilists
present.[2]
CONSPS. Unmask! Unmask! [3]Kill him! kill him![3] (_Masked CONSPIRATOR
unmasks._) Prince Paul!
VERA. Devil! Who lured you into the lion's den?
CONSPS. Kill him! kill him![4]
PRINCE PAUL. En verite, Messieurs, you are not over-hospitable in your
welcome.
VERA. Welcome! What welcome should we give you but the dagger or the
noose?
PRINCE PAUL. I had no idea, really, that the Nihilists were so
exclusive. Let me assure you that if I had not always had an _entree_
to the very best society, and the very worst conspiracies, I could never
have been Prime Minister in Russia.
VERA. The tiger cannot change its nature, nor the snake lose its venom;
but are you turned a lover of the people?
PRINCE PAUL. Mon Dieu, non, Mademoiselle! I would much sooner talk
scandal in a drawing-room than treason in a cellar. Besides, I hate the
common mob, who smell of garlic, smoke bad tobacco, get up early, and
dine off one dish.
PRES. What have you to gain, then, by a revolution?
PRINCE PAUL. Mon ami, I have nothing left to lose. That scatter-brained
boy, this new Czar, has banished me.
VERA. To Siberia?
PRINCE PAUL. No, to Paris. He has confiscated my estates, robbed me of
my office and my cook. I have nothing left but my decorations. I am here
for revenge.[5]
PRES. Then you have a right to be one of us. [5]We also meet daily for
revenge.[5]
PRINCE PAUL. You want money, of course. No one ever joins a conspiracy
who has any. Here. (_Throws money on table._) You have so many spies
that I should think you want information. Well, you will find me the
best informed man in Russia on the abuses of our Government. I made them
nearly all myself.
VERA. President, I don't trust this man. He has done us too much harm in
Russia to let him go in safety.
PRINCE PAUL. Believe me, Mademoiselle, you are wrong; I will be a most
valuable addition to your circle; as for you, gentlemen, if I had not
thought that you would be useful to me I shouldn't have risked my neck
among you, or dined an hour earlier than usual so as to be in time.
PRES. Ay, if he had wanted to spy on us, Vera, he wouldn't have come
himself.
PRINCE PAUL (_aside_). No; I should have sent my best friend.
PRES. Besides, Vera, he is just the man to give us the information we
want about some business we have in hand to-night.
