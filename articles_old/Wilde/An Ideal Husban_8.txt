MRS. CHEVELEY.  Even you are not rich enough, Sir Robert, to buy back
your past.  No man is.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I will not do what you ask me.  I will not.
MRS. CHEVELEY.  You have to.  If you don't . . . [_Rises from the sofa_.]
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Bewildered and unnerved_.]  Wait a moment!  What
did you propose?  You said that you would give me back my letter, didn't
you?
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Yes.  That is agreed.  I will be in the Ladies' Gallery
to-morrow night at half-past eleven.  If by that time--and you will have
had heaps of opportunity--you have made an announcement to the House in
the terms I wish, I shall hand you back your letter with the prettiest
thanks, and the best, or at any rate the most suitable, compliment I can
think of.  I intend to play quite fairly with you.  One should always
play fairly . . . when one has the winning cards.  The Baron taught me
that . . . amongst other things.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  You must let me have time to consider your
proposal.
MRS. CHEVELEY.  No; you must settle now!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Give me a week--three days!
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Impossible!  I have got to telegraph to Vienna to-night.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  My God! what brought you into my life?
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Circumstances.  [_Moves towards the door_.]
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Don't go.  I consent.  The report shall be
withdrawn.  I will arrange for a question to be put to me on the subject.
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Thank you.  I knew we should come to an amicable
agreement.  I understood your nature from the first.  I analysed you,
though you did not adore me.  And now you can get my carriage for me, Sir
Robert.  I see the people coming up from supper, and Englishmen always
get romantic after a meal, and that bores me dreadfully.  [_Exit_ SIR
ROBERT CHILTERN.]
[_Enter Guests_, LADY CHILTERN, LADY MARKBY, LORD CAVERSHAM, LADY
BASILDON, MRS. MARCHMONT, VICOMTE DE NANJAC, MR. MONTFORD.]
LADY MARKBY.  Well, dear Mrs. Cheveley, I hope you have enjoyed yourself.
Sir Robert is very entertaining, is he not?
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Most entertaining!  I have enjoyed my talk with him
immensely.
LADY MARKBY.  He has had a very interesting and brilliant career.  And he
has married a most admirable wife.  Lady Chiltern is a woman of the very
highest principles, I am glad to say.  I am a little too old now, myself,
to trouble about setting a good example, but I always admire people who
do.  And Lady Chiltern has a very ennobling effect on life, though her
dinner-parties are rather dull sometimes.  But one can't have everything,
can one?  And now I must go, dear.  Shall I call for you to-morrow?
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Thanks.
LADY MARKBY.  We might drive in the Park at five.  Everything looks so
fresh in the Park now!
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Except the people!
LADY MARKBY.  Perhaps the people are a little jaded.  I have often
observed that the Season as it goes on produces a kind of softening of
the brain.  However, I think anything is better than high intellectual
pressure.  That is the most unbecoming thing there is.  It makes the
noses of the young girls so particularly large.  And there is nothing so
difficult to marry as a large nose; men don't like them.  Good-night,
dear!  [_To_ LADY CHILTERN.]  Good-night, Gertrude!  [_Goes out on_ LORD
CAVERSHAM'S _arm_.]
