LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Smiling_.]  Ah! you are beginning to reform me.  It
is a dangerous thing to reform any one, Lady Windermere.  [_Bows_, _and
exit C._]
DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  [_Who has risen_, _goes C._]  What a charming,
wicked creature!  I like him so much.  Im quite delighted hes gone!
How sweet youre looking!  Where _do_ you get your gowns?  And now I must
tell you how sorry I am for you, dear Margaret.  [_Crosses to sofa and
sits with_ LADY WINDERMERE.]  Agatha, darling!
LADY AGATHA.  Yes, mamma.  [_Rises_.]
DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Will you go and look over the photograph album that
I see there?
LADY AGATHA.  Yes, mamma.  [_Goes to table up L._]
DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Dear girl!  She is so fond of photographs of
Switzerland.  Such a pure taste, I think.  But I really am so sorry for
you, Margaret.
LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Smiling_.]  Why, Duchess?
DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Oh, on account of that horrid woman.  She dresses so
well, too, which makes it much worse, sets such a dreadful example.
Augustusyou know my disreputable brothersuch a trial to us allwell,
Augustus is completely infatuated about her.  It is quite scandalous, for
she is absolutely inadmissible into society.  Many a woman has a past,
but I am told that she has at least a dozen, and that they all fit.
LADY WINDERMERE.  Whom are you talking about, Duchess?
DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  About Mrs. Erlynne.
LADY WINDERMERE.  Mrs. Erlynne?  I never heard of her, Duchess.  And what
_has_ she to do with me?
DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  My poor child!  Agatha, darling!
LADY AGATHA.  Yes, mamma.
DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Will you go out on the terrace and look at the
sunset?
LADY AGATHA.  Yes, mamma.
                                             [_Exit through window_, _L._]
DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Sweet girl!  So devoted to sunsets!  Shows such
refinement of feeling, does it not?  After all, there is nothing like
Nature, is there?
LADY WINDERMERE.  But what is it, Duchess?  Why do you talk to me about
this person?
DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Dont you really know?  I assure you were all so
distressed about it.  Only last night at dear Lady Jansens every one was
saying how extraordinary it was that, of all men in London, Windermere
should behave in such a way.
LADY WINDERMERE.  My husbandwhat has _he_ got to do with any woman of
that kind?
DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Ah, what indeed, dear?  That is the point.  He goes
to see her continually, and stops for hours at a time, and while he is
there she is not at home to any one.  Not that many ladies call on her,
dear, but she has a great many disreputable men friendsmy own brother
particularly, as I told youand that is what makes it so dreadful about
Windermere.  We looked upon _him_ as being such a model husband, but I am
afraid there is no doubt about it.  My dear niecesyou know the Saville
girls, dont you?such nice domestic creaturesplain, dreadfully plain,
but so goodwell, theyre always at the window doing fancy work, and
making ugly things for the poor, which I think so useful of them in these
dreadful socialistic days, and this terrible woman has taken a house in
Curzon Street, right opposite themsuch a respectable street, too!  I
dont know what were coming to!  And they tell me that Windermere goes
there four and five times a weekthey _see_ him.  They cant help itand
although they never talk scandal, theywell, of coursethey remark on it
to every one.  And the worst of it all is that I have been told that this
woman has got a great deal of money out of somebody, for it seems that
she came to London six months ago without anything at all to speak of,
and now she has this charming house in Mayfair, drives her ponies in the
Park every afternoon and allwell, allsince she has known poor dear
Windermere.
