[Goes down the garden with Dr. Chasuble.]
Cecily.  [Picks up books and throws them back on table.]  Horrid
Political Economy!  Horrid Geography!  Horrid, horrid German!
[Enter Merriman with a card on a salver.]
Merriman.  Mr. Ernest Worthing has just driven over from the station.  He
has brought his luggage with him.
Cecily.  [Takes the card and reads it.]  'Mr. Ernest Worthing, B. 4, The
Albany, W.'  Uncle Jack's brother!  Did you tell him Mr. Worthing was in
town?
Merriman.  Yes, Miss.  He seemed very much disappointed.  I mentioned
that you and Miss Prism were in the garden.  He said he was anxious to
speak to you privately for a moment.
Cecily.  Ask Mr. Ernest Worthing to come here.  I suppose you had better
talk to the housekeeper about a room for him.
Merriman.  Yes, Miss.
[Merriman goes off.]
Cecily.  I have never met any really wicked person before.  I feel rather
frightened.  I am so afraid he will look just like every one else.
[Enter Algernon, very gay and debonnair.]  He does!
Algernon.  [Raising his hat.]  You are my little cousin Cecily, I'm sure.
Cecily.  You are under some strange mistake.  I am not little.  In fact,
I believe I am more than usually tall for my age.  [Algernon is rather
taken aback.]  But I am your cousin Cecily.  You, I see from your card,
are Uncle Jack's brother, my cousin Ernest, my wicked cousin Ernest.
Algernon.  Oh! I am not really wicked at all, cousin Cecily.  You mustn't
think that I am wicked.
Cecily.  If you are not, then you have certainly been deceiving us all in
a very inexcusable manner.  I hope you have not been leading a double
life, pretending to be wicked and being really good all the time.  That
would be hypocrisy.
Algernon.  [Looks at her in amazement.]  Oh!  Of course I have been
rather reckless.
Cecily.  I am glad to hear it.
Algernon.  In fact, now you mention the subject, I have been very bad in
my own small way.
Cecily.  I don't think you should be so proud of that, though I am sure
it must have been very pleasant.
Algernon.  It is much pleasanter being here with you.
Cecily.  I can't understand how you are here at all.  Uncle Jack won't be
back till Monday afternoon.
Algernon.  That is a great disappointment.  I am obliged to go up by the
first train on Monday morning.  I have a business appointment that I am
anxious . . . to miss?
Cecily.  Couldn't you miss it anywhere but in London?
Algernon.  No: the appointment is in London.
Cecily.  Well, I know, of course, how important it is not to keep a
business engagement, if one wants to retain any sense of the beauty of
life, but still I think you had better wait till Uncle Jack arrives.  I
know he wants to speak to you about your emigrating.
Algernon.  About my what?
Cecily.  Your emigrating.  He has gone up to buy your outfit.
Algernon.  I certainly wouldn't let Jack buy my outfit.  He has no taste
in neckties at all.
