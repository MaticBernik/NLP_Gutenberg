DUKE
   No, my Lord Cardinal, I weary of her!
   Why, she is worse than ugly, she is good.
MAFFIO [_excitedly_]
   Your Grace, there are two thousand people there
   Who every moment grow more clamorous.
DUKE
   Tut, man, they waste their strength upon their lungs!
   People who shout so loud, my lords, do nothing;
   The only men I fear are silent men.
                                               [_A yell from the people_.]
   You see, Lord Cardinal, how my people love me.
                                                         [_Another yell_.]
   Go, Petrucci,
   And tell the captain of the guard below
   To clear the square.  Do you not hear me, sir?
   Do what I bid you.
                                                        [_Exit_ PETRUCCI.]
CARDINAL
   I beseech your Grace
   To listen to their grievances.
DUKE [_sitting on his throne_]
   Ay! the peaches
   Are not so big this year as they were last.
   I crave your pardon, my lord Cardinal,
   I thought you spake of peaches.
                                              [_A cheer from the people_.]
   What is that?
GUIDO [_rushes to the window_]
   The Duchess has gone forth into the square,
   And stands between the people and the guard,
   And will not let them shoot.
DUKE
   The devil take her!
GUIDO [_still at the window_]
   And followed by a dozen of the citizens
   Has come into the Palace.
DUKE [_starting up_]
   By Saint James,
   Our Duchess waxes bold!
BARDI
   Here comes the Duchess.
DUKE
   Shut that door there; this morning air is cold.
                                  [_They close the door on the corridor_.]
[_Enter the Duchess followed by a crowd of meanly dressed Citizens_.]
DUCHESS [_flinging herself upon her knees_]
   I do beseech your Grace to give us audience.
DUKE
   What are these grievances?
DUCHESS
   Alas, my Lord,
   Such common things as neither you nor I,
   Nor any of these noble gentlemen,
   Have ever need at all to think about;
   They say the bread, the very bread they eat,
   Is made of sorry chaff.
FIRST CITIZEN
   Ay! so it is,
   Nothing but chaff.
DUKE
   And very good food too,
   I give it to my horses.
DUCHESS [_restraining herself_]
   They say the water,
   Set in the public cisterns for their use,
   [Has, through the breaking of the aqueduct,]
   To stagnant pools and muddy puddles turned.
DUKE
   They should drink wine; water is quite unwholesome.
SECOND CITIZEN
   Alack, your Grace, the taxes which the customs
   Take at the city gate are grown so high
   We cannot buy wine.
DUKE
   Then you should bless the taxes
   Which make you temperate.
DUCHESS
   Think, while we sit
   In gorgeous pomp and state, gaunt poverty
   Creeps through their sunless lanes, and with sharp knives
   Cuts the warm throats of children stealthily
   And no word said.
THIRD CITIZEN
   Ay! marry, that is true,
   My little son died yesternight from hunger;
   He was but six years old; I am so poor,
   I cannot bury him.
DUKE
   If you are poor,
   Are you not blessed in that?  Why, poverty
   Is one of the Christian virtues,
                                                [_Turns to the_ CARDINAL.]
   Is it not?
   I know, Lord Cardinal, you have great revenues,
   Rich abbey-lands, and tithes, and large estates
   For preaching voluntary poverty.
