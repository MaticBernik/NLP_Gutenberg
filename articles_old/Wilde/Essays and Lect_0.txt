But in the case of Herodotus it will be more instructive to pass on from
points like these to those questions of general probability, the true
apprehension of which depends rather on a certain quality of mind than on
any possibility of formulated rules, questions which form no unimportant
part of scientific history; for it must be remembered always that the
canons of historical criticism are essentially different from those of
judicial evidence, for they cannot, like the latter, be made plain to
every ordinary mind, but appeal to a certain historical faculty founded
on the experience of life.  Besides, the rules for the reception of
evidence in courts of law are purely stationary, while the science of
historical probability is essentially progressive, and changes with the
advancing spirit of each age.
Now, of all the speculative canons of historical criticism, none is more
important than that which rests on psychological probability.
Arguing from his knowledge of human nature, Herodotus rejects the
presence of Helen within the walls of Troy.  Had she been there, he says,
Priam and his kinsmen would never have been so mad (_<U+03C6><U+03C1><U+03B5><U+03BD><U+03BF>ß<U+03BB><U+03B1>ß<U+03B5><U+1FD6><U+03C2>_) as
not to give her up, when they and their children and their city were in
such peril (ii. 118); and as regards the authority of Homer, some
incidental passages in his poem show that he knew of Helens sojourn in
Egypt during the siege, but selected the other story as being a more
suitable motive for an epic.  Similarly he does not believe that the
Alcmaonida family, a family who had always been the haters of tyranny
(_µ<U+03B9><U+03C3><U+03BF><U+03C4><U+03CD><U+03C1><U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03BD><U+03BF><U+03B9>_), and to whom, even more than to Harmodios and
Aristogeiton, Athens owed its liberty, would ever have been so
treacherous as to hold up a shield after the battle of Marathon as a
signal for the Persian host to fall on the city.  A shield, he
acknowledges, was held up, but it could not possibly have been done by
such friends of liberty as the house of Alcmaon; nor will he believe that
a great king like Rhampsinitus would have sent his daughter _<U+03BA><U+03B1><U+03C4><U+03AF><U+03C3><U+03B1><U+03B9> <U+1F10><U+03C0>
<U+03BF><U+1F30><U+03BA><U+03AE>µ<U+03B1><U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03C2>_.
Elsewhere he argues from more general considerations of probability; a
Greek courtesan like Rhodopis would hardly have been rich enough to build
a pyramid, and, besides, on chronological grounds the story is impossible
(ii. 134).
In another passage (ii. 63), after giving an account of the forcible
entry of the priests of Ares into the chapel of the gods mother, which
seems to have been a sort of religious faction fight where sticks were
freely used (_µ<U+03AC><U+03C7><U+03B7> <U+03BE><U+03CD><U+03BB><U+03BF><U+03B9><U+03C3><U+03B9> <U+03BA><U+03B1><U+03C1><U+03C4><U+03B5><U+03C1><U+03AE>_), I feel sure, he says, that many
of them died from getting their heads broken, notwithstanding the
assertions of the Egyptian priests to the contrary.  There is also
something charmingly naive in the account he gives of the celebrated
Greek swimmer who dived a distance of eighty stadia to give his
countrymen warning of the Persian advance.  If, however, he says, I
may offer an opinion on the subject, I would say that he came in a boat.
