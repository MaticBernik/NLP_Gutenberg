SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  In defending myself against Mrs. Cheveley, I have a
right to use any weapon I can find, have I not?
LORD GORING.  [_Still looking in the glass_.]  In your place I don't
think I should have the smallest scruple in doing so.  She is thoroughly
well able to take care of herself.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Sits down at the table and takes a pen in his
hand_.]  Well, I shall send a cipher telegram to the Embassy at Vienna,
to inquire if there is anything known against her.  There may be some
secret scandal she might be afraid of.
LORD GORING.  [_Settling his buttonhole_.]  Oh, I should fancy Mrs.
Cheveley is one of those very modern women of our time who find a new
scandal as becoming as a new bonnet, and air them both in the Park every
afternoon at five-thirty.  I am sure she adores scandals, and that the
sorrow of her life at present is that she can't manage to have enough of
them.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Writing_.]  Why do you say that?
LORD GORING.  [_Turning round_.]  Well, she wore far too much rouge last
night, and not quite enough clothes.  That is always a sign of despair in
a woman.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Striking a bell_.]  But it is worth while my
wiring to Vienna, is it not?
LORD GORING.  It is always worth while asking a question, though it is
not always worth while answering one.
[_Enter_ MASON.]
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Is Mr. Trafford in his room?
MASON.  Yes, Sir Robert.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Puts what he has written into an envelope_,
_which he then carefully closes_.]  Tell him to have this sent off in
cipher at once.  There must not be a moment's delay.
MASON.  Yes, Sir Robert.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Oh! just give that back to me again.
[_Writes something on the envelope_.  MASON _then goes out with the
letter_.]
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  She must have had some curious hold over Baron
Arnheim.  I wonder what it was.
LORD GORING.  [_Smiling_.]  I wonder.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I will fight her to the death, as long as my wife
knows nothing.
LORD GORING.  [_Strongly_.]  Oh, fight in any case--in any case.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_With a gesture of despair_.]  If my wife found
out, there would be little left to fight for.  Well, as soon as I hear
from Vienna, I shall let you know the result.  It is a chance, just a
chance, but I believe in it.  And as I fought the age with its own
weapons, I will fight her with her weapons.  It is only fair, and she
looks like a woman with a past, doesn't she?
LORD GORING.  Most pretty women do.  But there is a fashion in pasts just
as there is a fashion in frocks.  Perhaps Mrs. Cheveley's past is merely
a slightly decollete one, and they are excessively popular nowadays.
Besides, my dear Robert, I should not build too high hopes on frightening
Mrs. Cheveley.  I should not fancy Mrs. Cheveley is a woman who would be
easily frightened.  She has survived all her creditors, and she shows
wonderful presence of mind.
