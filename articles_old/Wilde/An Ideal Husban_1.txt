MRS. CHEVELEY.  Without the dreadful disadvantage of having a Penelope
waiting at home for him.
MASON.  Lord Goring.
[_Enter_ LORD GORING.  _Thirty-four_, _but always says he is younger_.
_A well-bred_, _expressionless face_.  _He is clever_, _but would not
like to be thought so_.  _A flawless dandy_, _he would be annoyed if he
were considered romantic_.  _He plays with life_, _and is on perfectly
good terms with the world_.  _He is fond of being misunderstood_.  _It
gives him a post of vantage_.]
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Good evening, my dear Arthur!  Mrs. Cheveley, allow
me to introduce to you Lord Goring, the idlest man in London.
MRS. CHEVELEY.  I have met Lord Goring before.
LORD GORING.  [_Bowing_.]  I did not think you would remember me, Mrs.
Cheveley.
MRS. CHEVELEY.  My memory is under admirable control.  And are you still
a bachelor?
LORD GORING.  I . . . believe so.
MRS. CHEVELEY.  How very romantic!
LORD GORING.  Oh! I am not at all romantic.  I am not old enough.  I
leave romance to my seniors.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Lord Goring is the result of Boodle's Club, Mrs.
Cheveley.
MRS. CHEVELEY.  He reflects every credit on the institution.
LORD GORING.  May I ask are you staying in London long?
MRS. CHEVELEY.  That depends partly on the weather, partly on the
cooking, and partly on Sir Robert.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  You are not going to plunge us into a European war,
I hope?
MRS. CHEVELEY.  There is no danger, at present!
[_She nods to_ LORD GORING, _with a look of amusement in her eyes_, _and
goes out with_ SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  LORD GORING _saunters over to_ MABEL
CHILTERN.]
MABEL CHILTERN.  You are very late!
LORD GORING.  Have you missed me?
MABEL CHILTERN.  Awfully!
LORD GORING.  Then I am sorry I did not stay away longer.  I like being
missed.
MABEL CHILTERN.  How very selfish of you!
LORD GORING.  I am very selfish.
MABEL CHILTERN.  You are always telling me of your bad qualities, Lord
Goring.
LORD GORING.  I have only told you half of them as yet, Miss Mabel!
MABEL CHILTERN.  Are the others very bad?
LORD GORING.  Quite dreadful!  When I think of them at night I go to
sleep at once.
MABEL CHILTERN.  Well, I delight in your bad qualities.  I wouldn't have
you part with one of them.
LORD GORING.  How very nice of you!  But then you are always nice.  By
the way, I want to ask you a question, Miss Mabel.  Who brought Mrs.
Cheveley here?  That woman in heliotrope, who has just gone out of the
room with your brother?
MABEL CHILTERN.  Oh, I think Lady Markby brought her.  Why do you ask?
LORD GORING.  I haven't seen her for years, that is all.
MABEL CHILTERN.  What an absurd reason!
LORD GORING.  All reasons are absurd.
MABEL CHILTERN.  What sort of a woman is she?
LORD GORING.  Oh! a genius in the daytime and a beauty at night!
MABEL CHILTERN.  I dislike her already.
LORD GORING.  That shows your admirable good taste.
