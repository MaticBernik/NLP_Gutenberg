LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Turning to her_.]  You opened a letter of mine to my
husband?  You wouldnt dare!
MRS. ERLYNNE.  Dare!  Oh! to save you from the abyss into which you are
falling, there is nothing in the world I would not dare, nothing in the
whole world.  Here is the letter.  Your husband has never read it.  He
never shall read it.  [_Going to fireplace_.]  It should never have been
written.  [_Tears it and throws it into the fire_.]
LADY WINDERMERE.  [_With infinite contempt in her voice and look_.]  How
do I know that that was my letter after all?  You seem to think the
commonest device can take me in!
MRS. ERLYNNE.  Oh! why do you disbelieve everything I tell you?  What
object do you think I have in coming here, except to save you from utter
ruin, to save you from the consequence of a hideous mistake?  That letter
that is burnt now _was_ your letter.  I swear it to you!
LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Slowly_.]  You took good care to burn it before I had
examined it.  I cannot trust you.  You, whose whole life is a lie, could
you speak the truth about anything?  [_Sits down_.]
MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_Hurriedly_.]  Think as you like about mesay what you
choose against me, but go back, go back to the husband you love.
LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Sullenly_.]  I do _not_ love him!
MRS. ERLYNNE.  You do, and you know that he loves you.
LADY WINDERMERE.  He does not understand what love is.  He understands it
as little as you dobut I see what you want.  It would be a great
advantage for you to get me back.  Dear Heaven! what a life I would have
then!  Living at the mercy of a woman who has neither mercy nor pity in
her, a woman whom it is an infamy to meet, a degradation to know, a vile
woman, a woman who comes between husband and wife!
MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_With a gesture of despair_.]  Lady Windermere, Lady
Windermere, dont say such terrible things.  You dont know how terrible
they are, how terrible and how unjust.  Listen, you must listen!  Only go
back to your husband, and I promise you never to communicate with him
again on any pretextnever to see himnever to have anything to do with
his life or yours.  The money that he gave me, he gave me not through
love, but through hatred, not in worship, but in contempt.  The hold I
have over him
LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Rising_.]  Ah! you admit you have a hold!
MRS. ERLYNNE.  Yes, and I will tell you what it is.  It is his love for
you, Lady Windermere.
LADY WINDERMERE.  You expect me to believe that?
MRS. ERLYNNE.  You must believe it!  It is true.  It is his love for you
that has made him submit tooh! call it what you like, tyranny, threats,
anything you choose.  But it is his love for you.  His desire to spare
youshame, yes, shame and disgrace.
LADY WINDERMERE.  What do you mean?  You are insolent!  What have I to do
with you?
