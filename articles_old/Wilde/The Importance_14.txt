Jack.  Oh yes.
Miss Prism.  [Bitterly.]  People who live entirely for pleasure usually
are.
Jack.  But it is not for any child, dear Doctor.  I am very fond of
children.  No! the fact is, I would like to be christened myself, this
afternoon, if you have nothing better to do.
Chasuble.  But surely, Mr. Worthing, you have been christened already?
Jack.  I don't remember anything about it.
Chasuble.  But have you any grave doubts on the subject?
Jack.  I certainly intend to have.  Of course I don't know if the thing
would bother you in any way, or if you think I am a little too old now.
Chasuble.  Not at all.  The sprinkling, and, indeed, the immersion of
adults is a perfectly canonical practice.
Jack.  Immersion!
Chasuble.  You need have no apprehensions.  Sprinkling is all that is
necessary, or indeed I think advisable.  Our weather is so changeable.  At
what hour would you wish the ceremony performed?
Jack.  Oh, I might trot round about five if that would suit you.
Chasuble.  Perfectly, perfectly!  In fact I have two similar ceremonies
to perform at that time.  A case of twins that occurred recently in one
of the outlying cottages on your own estate.  Poor Jenkins the carter, a
most hard-working man.
Jack.  Oh!  I don't see much fun in being christened along with other
babies.  It would be childish.  Would half-past five do?
Chasuble.  Admirably!  Admirably!  [Takes out watch.]  And now, dear Mr.
Worthing, I will not intrude any longer into a house of sorrow.  I would
merely beg you not to be too much bowed down by grief.  What seem to us
bitter trials are often blessings in disguise.
Miss Prism.  This seems to me a blessing of an extremely obvious kind.
[Enter Cecily from the house.]
Cecily.  Uncle Jack!  Oh, I am pleased to see you back.  But what horrid
clothes you have got on!  Do go and change them.
Miss Prism.  Cecily!
Chasuble.  My child! my child!  [Cecily goes towards Jack; he kisses her
brow in a melancholy manner.]
Cecily.  What is the matter, Uncle Jack?  Do look happy!  You look as if
you had toothache, and I have got such a surprise for you.  Who do you
think is in the dining-room?  Your brother!
Jack.  Who?
Cecily.  Your brother Ernest.  He arrived about half an hour ago.
Jack.  What nonsense!  I haven't got a brother.
Cecily.  Oh, don't say that.  However badly he may have behaved to you in
the past he is still your brother.  You couldn't be so heartless as to
disown him.  I'll tell him to come out.  And you will shake hands with
him, won't you, Uncle Jack?  [Runs back into the house.]
Chasuble.  These are very joyful tidings.
Miss Prism.  After we had all been resigned to his loss, his sudden
return seems to me peculiarly distressing.
Jack.  My brother is in the dining-room?  I don't know what it all means.
I think it is perfectly absurd.
[Enter Algernon and Cecily hand in hand.  They come slowly up to Jack.]
