  _Scroop._ (R.) That's mercy, but too much security:
  Let him be punish'd, sovereign; lest example
  Breed, by his sufferance, more of such a kind.
  _K. Hen._ O, let us yet be merciful.
  _Cam._ So may your highness, and yet punish too.
  _Grey._ Sir, you show great mercy, if you give him life,
  After the taste of much correction.
  _K. Hen._ Alas, your too much love and care of me
  Are heavy orisons 'gainst this poor wretch![4]
  If little faults, proceeding on distemper,[5]
  Shall not be wink'd at, how shall we stretch our eye[6]
  When capital crimes, chew'd, swallow'd, and digested,
  Appear before us?--We'll yet enlarge that man,
  Though Cambridge, Scroop, and Grey,--in their dear care
  And tender preservation of our person,--
  Would have him punish'd. And now to our French causes:
    [_All take their places at Council table._
  Who are the late Commissioners?[7]
  _Cam._ (_R. of table._)       I one, my lord:
  Your highness bade me ask for it to-day.
  _Scroop._ (_R. of table._) So did you me, my liege.
  _Grey._ (_R. of table._) And me, my royal sovereign.
  _K. Hen._ Then, Richard earl of Cambridge, there is yours;--
  There yours, lord Scroop of Masham;--and, sir knight,
  Grey of Northumberland, this same is yours:--
  Read them; and know, I know your worthiness.--
  My lord of Westmoreland,--and uncle Exeter,--
    [_L. of table._
  We will aboard to-night.
    (_Conspirators start from their places._)
                          Why, how now, gentlemen!
  What see you in those papers, that you lose
  So much complexion?--look ye, how they change!
  Their cheeks are paper.--Why, what read you there,
  That hath so cowarded and chas'd your blood
  Out of appearance?
  _Cam._           I do confess my fault;
  And do submit me to your highness' mercy.
    [_Falling on his knees._
  _Grey._   } To which we all appeal.    [_Kneeling._
  _Scroop._ }
  _K. Hen._ (_rising; all the LORDS rise with the KING._)
  The mercy that was quick[8] in us but late,
  By your own counsel is suppress'd and kill'd:
  You must not dare, for shame, to talk of mercy.
  See you, my princes and my noble peers,
  These English monsters! My lord of Cambridge here,--
  You know how apt our love was to accord
  To furnish him with all appertinents
  Belonging to his honour; and this man
  Hath, for a few light crowns, lightly conspir'd,
  And sworn unto the practises of France,
  To kill us here in Hampton: to the which
  This knight, no less for bounty bound to us
  Than Cambridge is,--hath likewise sworn.--But, O,
  What shall I say to thee, lord Scroop? thou cruel,
  Ingrateful, savage, and inhuman creature!
  Thou that did'st bear the key of all my counsels,
  That knew'st the very bottom of my soul,
  That almost might'st have coin'd me into gold,
  May it be possible, that foreign hire
  Could out of thee extract one spark of evil
  That might annoy my finger? 'Tis so strange,
  That, though the truth of it stands off as gross[9]
  As black from white,[10] my eye will scarcely see it;
  For this revolt of thine, methinks, is like
  Another fall of man.--Their faults are open:
  Arrest them to the answer of the law;--
