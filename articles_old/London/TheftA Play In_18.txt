(_To Dobleman._)
Did Martinaw give you any idea of the nature of the stolen
documents?
{Dobleman}
(_Referring to notes he has brought._) Of course I don't know
anything about it, but he spoke of the Goodyear letters--
(_Starkweather betrays by his face the gravity of the
information._)
the Caledonian letters, all the Black Rider correspondence. He
mentioned, too, (_Referring to notes._) the Astonbury and Glutz
letters. And there were others, many others, not designated.
{Starkweather}
This is terrible!
(_Recollecting himself._)
Thank you, Dobleman. Will you please return to the house at once.
Get New York again, and fullest details. I'll follow you shortly.
Have you a machine?
{Dobleman}
A taxi, sir.
{Starkweather}
All right, and be careful.
(_Dobleman makes exit_)
{Chalmers}
I don't know the import of all these letters, but I can guess,
and it does seem serious.
{Starkweather}
(_Furiously._) Serious! Let me tell you that there has been no
exposure like this in the history of the country. It means
hundreds of millions of dollars. It means more--the loss of
power. And still more, it means the mob, the great mass of the
child-minded people rising up and destroying all that I have
labored to do for them. Oh, the fools! The fools!
{Hubbard}
(_Shaking his head ominously._) There is no telling what may happen
if Knox makes that speech and delivers the proofs.
{Chalmers}
It is unfortunate. The people are restless and excited as it
is. They are being constantly prodded on by the mouthings of
the radical press, of the muck-raking magazines and of the
demagogues. The people are like powder awaiting the spark.
{Starkweather}
This man Knox is no fool, if he _is_ a dreamer. He is a shrewd
knave. He is a fighter. He comes from the West--the old pioneer
stock. His father drove an ox-team across the Plains to Oregon.
He knows how to play his cards, and never could circumstances
have placed more advantageous cards in his hands.
{Chalmers}
And nothing like this has ever touched you before.
{Starkweather}
I have always stood above the muck and ruck--clear and clean and
unassailable. But this--this is too much! It is the spark. There
is no forecasting what it may develop into.
{Chalmers}
A political turnover.
{Starkweather}
(_Nodding savagely._) A new party, a party of demagogues, in power.
Government ownership of the railways and telegraphs. A graduated
income tax that will mean no less than the confiscation of
private capital.
{Chalmers}
And all that mass of radical legislation--the Child Labor Bill,
the new Employers' Liability Act, the government control of the
Alaskan coal fields, that interference with Mexico. And that big
power corporation you have worked so hard to form.
{Starkweather}
It must not be. It is an unthinkable calamity. It means that the
very process of capitalistic development is hindered, stopped.
It means a setback of ten years in the process. It means work,
endless work, to overcome the setback. It means not alone the
passage of all this radical legislation with the consequent
disadvantages, but it means the fingers of the mob clutching at
our grip of control. It means anarchy. It means ruin and misery
for all the blind fools and led-cattle of the mass who will
strike at the very sources of their own existence and comfort.
