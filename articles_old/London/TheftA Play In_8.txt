{Chalmers}
Lose?--Me?
{Starkweather}
I have but to raise my hand, any time--do you understand?--any
time, and you are lost. You control your state. Very well. But
never forget that to-morrow, if I wished, I could buy your whole
machine out from under you. I know you cannot change yourself,
but, for the sake of the big issues at stake, you must be
careful, exceedingly careful. We are compelled to work with weak
tools. You are a good liver, a flesh-pot man. You drink too
much. Your heart is weak.--Oh, I have the report of your doctor.
Nevertheless, don't make a fool of yourself, nor of us. Besides,
do not forget that your wife is my daughter. She is a strong
woman, a credit to both of us. Be careful that you are not a
discredit to her.
{Chalmers}
All right, I'll be careful. But while we are--er--on this
subject, there's something I'd like to speak to you about.
(_A pause, in which Starkweather waits non-committally._) It's
this man Knox, and Madge. He comes to the house. They are as
thick as thieves.
{Starkweather}
Yes?
{Chalmers}
(_Hastily._) Oh, not a breath of suspicion or anything of
that sort, I assure you. But it doesn't strike me as exactly
appropriate that your daughter and my wife should be friendly
with this fire-eating anarchist who is always attacking us and
all that we represent.
{Starkweather}
I started to speak with her on that subject, but was interrupted.
(_Puckers brow and thinks._) You are her husband. Why don't you
take her in hand yourself?
(_Enters Mrs. Starkweather from rear, looking about, bowing, then
locating Starkweather and proceeding toward him._)
{Chalmers}
What can I do? She has a will of her own--the same sort of a will
that you have. Besides, I think she knows about my--about some of
my--indiscretions.
{Starkweather}
(_Slyly._)
_Harmless_ indiscretions?
(_Chalmers is about to reply, but observes Mrs. Starkweather
approaching._)
{Mrs. Starkweather}
(_Speaks in a peevish, complaining voice, and during her harrangue
Starkweather immerses himself in notebook._) Oh, there you are,
Anthony. Talking politics, I suppose. Well, as soon as I get a
cup of tea we must go. Tommy is not looking as well as I could
wish. Margaret loves him, but she does not take the right care of
him. I don't know what the world is coming to when mothers do
not know how to rear their offspring. There is Margaret, with her
slum kindergartens, taking care of everybody else's children but
her own. If she only performed her church duties as eagerly!
Mr. Rutland is displeased with her. I shall give her a talking
to--only, you'd better do it, Anthony. Somehow, I have never
counted much with Margaret. She is as set in doing what she
pleases as you are. In my time children paid respect to their
parents. This is what comes of speed. There is no time for
anything. And now I must get my tea and run. Connie has to dress
for that dinner.
