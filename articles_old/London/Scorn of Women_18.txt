Want you.
VANDERLIP
I haven't anything to do with her. She can keep on wanting. I'm busy.
SITKA CHARLEY
Um want you now, right away, quick.
VANDERLIP
_(Angrily.)_
You go to the devil. And she can go, too, for all I care.
_(Enter Dave Harney from left, still reading newspaper, and followed
by the dancers.)_
SITKA CHARLEY
I tell Freda you say go to devil?
VANDERLIP
_(Flinging away angrily.)_
Tell her! Tell her! Just as long as you quit bothering me.
_(And then, seriously.)_
And when you've told her you'd better go and see everything's in
shape.
SITKA CHARLEY
_(Starting for street door.)_
Dogs, sleds, everything all right.
_(Exit Sitka Charley.)_
DAVE HARNEY
_(In centre of stage, turning suddenly upon rout at his heels.)_
Well? What d'ye want?
_(The rout gathers about him, facing him. There are cries of: "The
news! The news!" "What's happening down in God's country?" "Who won the
championship?" "How'd the election turn out?" "Was Tammany downed?" "Is
it true the United States is fighting Germany?" "Is war really
declared?" etc.)_
DAVE HARNEY
Got any sugar?
_(Groans, cat-calls, and laughter.)_
A Voice
The meanest man in the Klondike.
DAVE HARNEY
So you'd be, dodgast you, if you hadn't no sweetenin' for your coffee
and mush.
Another Voice Speech! Speech!
Voices
Speech! Speech!
DAVE HARNEY
All right, consarn you, I'll speechify.
_(Clears his throat.)_
Ladies an' gentlemen--ahem--
_(Stops to clear throat.)_
A VOICE
Bring him some water. A glass of water, please, for the speaker.
ANOTHER VOICE
Get a box for him.
_(The firewood is dumped out of the wood-box, which is placed before
Dave Harney upside down. He is helped upon it.)_
A VOICE
Now he's going to read us all the news. _(Cheers and hand-clapping.)_
DAVE HARNEY
_(Folding newspaper and putting it in his pocket.)_
My friend, you've got another guess comin'. I'm goin' to read you the
riot act. An' here it is, short an' simple. You've got all the sugar,
an' I've got all the noos. Nothin' to it but a dicker. We'll swop.
That's what we'll do, we'll swop. _(Cheers.)_
An' I say again, for them as is dull of hearin', we'll swop. After the
unmaskin', you all will assemble here in this here room an' hear the
noospaper read, advertisements an' all.
_(Cheers.)_
An' in the meantime, I'm open to subscriptions in the form of
promissory notes. Said notes shall be for the sum of one heapin',
large tin cup of sugar, white or brown, to be paid to party of the
first part--you all is party to the second part--to be paid to party
of the first part inside twenty-four hours after the delivery of the
goods, to wit, the noos. Said party of the first part hereby agreein'
to send a man with a sack around to the cabins of said party of the
second part an' collect face value of promissory note, to wit, one
heapin', large tin cup of sugar, white or brown. Them that signs notes
hears the noospaper read, them that don't, don't. Thankin' you kindly,
one an' all, I remain, yours truly, an' am ready to take promissory
notes here an' now.
