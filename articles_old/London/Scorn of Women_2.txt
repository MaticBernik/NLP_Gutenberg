LORAINE
And you do love only me?
_(He nods.)_
Then tell me that you do.
VANDERLIP
_(With impulsive eagerness, half lifting his arms as if to embrace her
and controlling himself with an effort.)_
Oh, I do, Loraine. I do, I do.
LORAINE
It is sweet to hear you say it. And now you really must go. Good-by,
dear, good-by.
_(He crosses stage to left and goes out.)_
_(She starts to cross stage to rear, but is approached and stopped by
Sitka Charley.)_
SITKA CHARLEY
_(Gruffly.)_ Good morning.
LORAINE
_(Sweetly.)_
Good morning, Charley.
SITKA CHARLEY
_(Bluntly.)_
You got my money?
LORAINE
Oh, let me see. How much is it?
SITKA CHARLEY
Two hundred dollar.
LORAINE
I'll tell you. You come to my cabin to-morrow morning, and I'll give
it to you.
SITKA CHARLEY
_(Not letting on that he knows she is lying.)_ To-morrow morning you
give me money?
LORAINE
At my cabin, don't forget.
SITKA CHARLEY
All right, to-morrow morning.
_(He turns abruptly and starts to go toward stove.)_
LORAINE
_(Calling.)_
Oh, Charley!
_(He turns back to her.)_
Is Dominion Creek very rich?
SITKA CHARLEY
Dam rich.
LORAINE
And do you know whether Mr. Vanderlip has any claims there?
SITKA CHARLEY
Me no know.
_(Starts to go.)_
LORAINE
_(Detaining him.)_
But Mr. Vanderlip is very rich, isn't he? You know that?
SITKA CHARLEY
Vanderlip dam rich.
_(Sitka Charley turns abruptly and goes back to stove.)_
_(Loraine crosses stage to left rear to counter, where a clerk waits
upon her.)_
_(Enter Mrs. Eppingwell and Mrs. McFee from right. Both engage in
brushing snow from moccasins.)_
MRS. EPPINGWELL
_(Finishing first, and looking about the store as if in quest of some
one.)_ as I don't see anything of Captain Eppingwell, and he is the
soul of promptness.
MRS. McFEE
_(Still brushing snow.)_
Mayhap we are a bit early, Mrs. Eppingwell. But as I was saying, it's
verra dootful morals the giving of this masked ball. Masked, mind you,
with every low dance-hall creature a-dying to come and put decent folk
to the shame of their company. I speak my mind, and it's ay shameful
that honest bodies must be so sore put. There'll be ruffians and
gamblers with masks over their sinful faces, and who's to know? And
there's that Freda woman. 'Tis said she plays with the souls of men as
a child with a wee bit of a pipe plays with soap-bubbles. And there's
all the rest--bold hussies!--who's to stop them from flaunting their
fine feathers in our faces? Who's to stop them, I make free to ask?
MRS. EPPINGWELL
_(Smiling.)_
The doorkeeper, of course. It is quite simple. Masks must be lifted at
the door.
MRS. McFEE
Ou, ay, verra simple, I should say. Belike you'll undertake the
doorkeeping, and belike you'll know the face of every rapscallion of
them.
MRS. EPPINGWELL
We'll get one of the men who do know--Mr. Prince, for example. There
he is, by the stove. We'll ask him to be doorkeeper.
_(Prince goes to rear and joins Loraine.)_
