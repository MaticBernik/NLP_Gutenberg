{Margaret}
(_Shaking her head, speaking low._) Dear delightful Ali Baba.
{Knox}
(_Glumly._) I suppose I've made a fool of myself.
{Margaret}
(_Earnestly._) On the contrary, you were delightful. I am proud of
you.
(_As Knox shakes hands with Margaret, Sakari arises and comes
forward_).
{Sakari}
I, too, must go. I have had a charming half hour, Mrs. Chalmers.
But I shall not attempt to thank you.
(_He shakes hands with Margaret._)
(_Knox and Sakari proceed to make exit to rear._)
(_Just as they go out, Servant enters, carrying card-tray, and
advances toward Starkweather._)
(_Margaret joins Dolores Ortega and Chalmers, seats herself with
them, and proceeds to talk motor-cars._)
(_Servant has reached Starkweather, who has taken a telegram from
tray, opened it, and is reading it._)
{Starkweather}
Damnation!
{Servant}
I beg your pardon, sir.
{Starkweather}
Send Senator Chalmers to me, and Mr. Hubbard.
{Servant}
Yes, sir.
(_Servant crosses to Chalmers and Hubbard, both of whom
immediately arise and cross to Starkweather._)
(_While this is being done, Margaret reassembles the three
broken groups into one, seating herself so that she can watch
Starkweather and his group across the stage._)
(_Servant lingers to receive a command from Margaret._)
(_Chalmers and Hubbard wait a moment, standing, while Starkweather
rereads telegram._)
{Starkweather}
(_Standing up._) Dobleman has just forwarded this telegram. It's
from New York--from Martinaw. There's been rottenness. My papers
and letter-files have been ransacked. It's the confidential
stenographer who has been tampered with--you remember that
middle-aged, youngish-oldish woman, Tom? That's the one.--Where's
that servant?
(_Servant is just making exit._) Here! Come here!
(_Servant comes over to Starkweather._) Go to the telephone and
call up Dobleman. Tell him to come here.
{Servant}
(_Perplexed._) I beg pardon, sir.
{Starkweather}
(_Irritably._) My secretary. At my house. Dobleman. Tell him to
come at once.
(_Servant makes exit._)
{Chalmers}
But who can be the principal behind this theft?
(_Starkweather shrugs his shoulders._)
{Hubbard}
A blackmailing device most probably. They will attempt to bleed
you--
{Chalmers}
Unless--
{Starkweather}
(_Impatiently._) Yes?
{Chalmers}
Unless they are to be used to-morrow in that speech of Knox.
(_Comprehension dawns on the faces of the other two men._)
{Mrs. Starkweather}
(_Who has arisen._) Anthony, we must go now. Are you ready? Connie
has to dress.
{Starkweather}
I am not going now. You and Connie take the car.
{Mrs. Starkweather}
You mustn't forget you are going to that dinner.
{Starkweather}
(_Wearily._) Do I ever forget?
(_Servant enters and proceeds toward Starkweather, where he
stands waiting while Mrs. Starkweather finishes the next speech.
Starkweather listens to her with a patient, stony face._)
{Mrs. Starkweather}
Oh, these everlasting politics! That is what it has been all
afternoon--high prices, graft, and theft; theft, graft, and high
prices. It is terrible. When I was a girl we did not talk of such
things. Well, come on, Connie.
{Mrs. Dowsett}
(_Rising and glancing at Dowsett._) And we must be going, too.
(_During the following scene, which takes place around
Starkweather, Margaret is saying good-bye to her departing
guests._)
(_Mrs. Starkweather and Connie make exit._)
