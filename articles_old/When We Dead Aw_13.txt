MAIA.
[At last catches sight of RUBEK and calls.] Hallo!
    [She advances over the upland, jumps over the brook, with the
       aid of her alpenstock, and climbs up the hillock.
MAIA.
[Panting.] Oh, how I have been rushing around looking for you, Rubek.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Nods indifferently and asks.] Have you just come from the hotel?
MAIA.
Yes, that was the last place I tried--that fly-trap.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Looking at her for moment.] I noticed that you were not at the
dinner-table.
MAIA.
No, we had our dinner in the open air, we two.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
"We two"? What two?
MAIA.
Why, I and that horrid bear-killer, of course.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Oh, he.
MAIA.
Yes. And first thing to-morrow morning we are going off again.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
After bears?
MAIA.
Yes. Off to kill a brown-boy.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Have you found the tracks of any?
MAIA.
[With superiority.] You don't suppose that bears are to be found in the
naked mountains, do you?
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Where, then?
MAIA.
Far beneath. On the lower slopes; in the thickest parts of the forest.
Places your ordinary town-folk could never get through--
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
And you two are going down there to-morrow?
MAIA.
[Throwing herself down among the heather.] Yes, so we have arranged.--Or
perhaps we may start this evening.--If you have no objection, that's to
say?
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
I? Far be it from me to--
MAIA.
[Quickly.] Of course Lars goes with us--with the dogs.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
I feel no curiosity as to the movements of Mr. Lars and his dogs.
[Changing the subject.] Would you not rather sit properly on the seat?
MAIA.
[Drowsily.] No, thank you. I'm lying so delightfully in the soft
heather.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
I can see that you are tired.
MAIA.
[Yawning.] I almost think I'm beginning to feel tired.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
You don't notice it till afterwards--when the excitement is over--
MAIA.
[In a drowsy tone.] Just so. I will lie and close my eyes.
    [A short pause.
MAIA.
[With sudden impatience.] Ugh, Rubek--how can you endure to sit there
listening to these children's screams! And to watch all the capers they
are cutting, too!
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
There is something harmonious--almost like music--in their movements,
now and then; amid all the clumsiness. And it amuses me to sit and watch
for these isolated moments--when they come.
MAIA.
[With a somewhat scornful laugh.] Yes, you are always, always an artist.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
And I propose to remain one.
MAIA.
[Lying on her side, so that her back is turned to him.] There's not a
bit of the artist about him.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[With attention.] Who is it that's not an artist?
MAIA.
[Again in a sleepy tone.] Why, he--the other one, of course.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
The bear-hunter, you mean?
MAIA.
Yes. There's not a bit of the artist about him--not the least little
bit.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Smiling.] No, I believe there's no doubt about that.
MAIA.
[Vehemently, without moving.] And so ugly as he is! [Plucks up a tuft of
heather and throws it away.] So ugly, so ugly! Isch!
