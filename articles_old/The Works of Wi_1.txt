Scene II. _A bedchamber in the_ Lord's _house._
_Enter aloft_ SLY, _with_ Attendants; _some with apparel_, _others with_
_basin and ewer and other appurtenances_, _and_ Lord.
    _Sly_. For God's sake, a pot of small ale.
    _First Serv_. Will't please your lordship drink a cup of
    sack?
    _Sec. Serv_. Will't please your honour taste of these
    conserves?
    _Third Serv._ What raiment will your honour wear to-day?
    _Sly._ I am Christophero Sly; call not me 'honour' nor             5
    'lordship:' I ne'er drank sack in my life; and if you give me
    any conserves, give me conserves of beef: ne'er ask me
    what raiment I'll wear; for I have no more doublets than
    backs, no more stockings than legs, nor no more shoes than
    feet; nay, sometime more feet than shoes, or such shoes as        10
    my toes look through the overleather.
    _Lord._ Heaven cease this idle humour in your honour!
    O, that a mighty man of such descent,
    Of such possessions and so high esteem,
    Should be infused with so foul a spirit!                          15
    _Sly._ What, would you make me mad? Am not I
    Christopher Sly, old Sly's son of Burton-heath, by birth a
    pedlar, by education a card-maker, by transmutation a
    bear-herd, and now by present profession a tinker? Ask
    Marian Hacket, the fat ale-wife of Wincot, if she know me         20
    not: if she say I am not fourteen pence on the score for
    sheer ale, score me up for the lyingest knave in Christendom.
    What! I am not bestraught: here's--
    _Third Serv._ O, this it is that makes your lady mourn!
    _Sec. Serv._ O, this is it that makes your servants droop!        25
    _Lord._ Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house,
    As beaten hence by your strange lunacy.
    O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth,
    Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment
    And banish hence these abject lowly dreams.                       30
    Look how thy servants do attend on thee,
    Each in his office ready at thy beck.
    Wilt thou have music? hark! Apollo plays,          [_Music._
    And twenty caged nightingales do sing:
    Or wilt thou sleep? we'll have thee to a couch                    35
    Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed
    On purpose trimm'd up for Semiramis.
    Say thou wilt walk; we will bestrew the ground:
    Or wilt thou ride? thy horses shall be trapp'd,
    Their harness studded all with gold and pearl.                    40
    Dost thou love hawking? thou hast hawks will soar
    Above the morning lark: or wilt thou hunt?
    Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them,
    And fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth.
    _First Serv._ Say thou wilt course; thy greyhounds are as swift   45
    As breathed stags, ay, fleeter than the roe.
    _Sec. Serv._ Dost thou love pictures? we will fetch thee straight
    Adonis painted by a running brook
    And Cytherea all in sedges hid
    Which seem to move and wanton with her breath,                    50
    Even as the waving sedges play with wind.
    _Lord._ We'll show thee Io as she was a maid
    And how she was beguiled and surprised,
    As lively painted as the deed was done.
