When you were first established in this infant business, which promises
to thrive so well, pursued John, I came to you, in my search for almost
any employment, and you made me your clerk.
Still not worth mentioning, my dear John Spatter, said I; still,
equally true.
And finding that I had a good head for business, and that I was really
useful _to_ the business, you did not like to retain me in that capacity,
and thought it an act of justice soon to make me your partner.
Still less worth mentioning than any of those other little circumstances
you have recalled, John Spatter, said I; for I was, and am, sensible of
your merits and my deficiencies.
Now, my good friend, said John, drawing my arm through his, as he had
had a habit of doing at school; while two vessels outside the windows of
our counting-housewhich were shaped like the stern windows of a
shipwent lightly down the river with the tide, as John and I might then
be sailing away in company, and in trust and confidence, on our voyage of
life; let there, under these friendly circumstances, be a right
understanding between us.  You are too easy, Michael.  You are nobodys
enemy but your own.  If I were to give you that damaging character among
our connexion, with a shrug, and a shake of the head, and a sigh; and if
I were further to abuse the trust you place in me
But you never will abuse it at all, John, I observed.
Never! said he; but I am putting a caseI say, and if I were further
to abuse that trust by keeping this piece of our common affairs in the
dark, and this other piece in the light, and again this other piece in
the twilight, and so on, I should strengthen my strength, and weaken your
weakness, day by day, until at last I found myself on the high road to
fortune, and you left behind on some bare common, a hopeless number of
miles out of the way.
Exactly so, said I.
To prevent this, Michael, said John Spatter, or the remotest chance of
this, there must be perfect openness between us.  Nothing must be
concealed, and we must have but one interest.
My dear John Spatter, I assured him, that is precisely what I mean.
And when you are too easy, pursued John, his face glowing with
friendship, you must allow me to prevent that imperfection in your
nature from being taken advantage of, by any one; you must not expect me
to humour it
My dear John Spatter, I interrupted, I _dont_ expect you to humour
it.  I want to correct it.
And I, too, said John.
Exactly so! cried I.  We both have the same end in view; and,
honourably seeking it, and fully trusting one another, and having but one
interest, ours will be a prosperous and happy partnership.
I am sure of it! returned John Spatter.  And we shook hands most
affectionately.
