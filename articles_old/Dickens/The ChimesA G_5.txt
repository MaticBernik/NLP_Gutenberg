But Trotty had a fathers heart within him; which had somehow got into
his breast in spite of this decree; and he could not bear that Meg, in
the blush of her brief joy, should have her fortune read by these wise
gentlemen.  God help her, thought poor Trotty.  She will know it soon
enough.
He anxiously signed, therefore, to the young smith, to take her away.
But he was so busy, talking to her softly at a little distance, that he
only became conscious of this desire, simultaneously with Alderman Cute.
Now, the Alderman had not yet had his say, but _he_ was a philosopher,
toopractical, though!  Oh, very practicaland, as he had no idea of
losing any portion of his audience, he cried Stop!
Now, you know, said the Alderman, addressing his two friends, with a
self-complacent smile upon his face which was habitual to him, I am a
plain man, and a practical man; and I go to work in a plain practical
way.  Thats my way.  There is not the least mystery or difficulty in
dealing with this sort of people if you only understand em, and can talk
to em in their own manner.  Now, you Porter!  Dont you ever tell me, or
anybody else, my friend, that you havent always enough to eat, and of
the best; because I know better.  I have tasted your tripe, you know, and
you cant chaff me.  You understand what chaff means, eh?  Thats the
right word, isnt it?  Ha, ha, ha! Lord bless you, said the Alderman,
turning to his friends again, its the easiest thing on earth to deal
with this sort of people, if you understand em.
Famous man for the common people, Alderman Cute!  Never out of temper
with them!  Easy, affable, joking, knowing gentleman!
You see, my friend, pursued the Alderman, theres a great deal of
nonsense talked about Wanthard up, you know; thats the phrase, isnt
it? ha! ha! ha!and I intend to Put it Down.  Theres a certain amount of
cant in vogue about Starvation, and I mean to Put it Down.  Thats all!
Lord bless you, said the Alderman, turning to his friends again, you
may Put Down anything among this sort of people, if you only know the way
to set about it.
Trotty took Megs hand and drew it through his arm.  He didnt seem to
know what he was doing though.
Your daughter, eh? said the Alderman, chucking her familiarly under the
chin.
Always affable with the working classes, Alderman Cute!  Knew what
pleased them!  Not a bit of pride!
Wheres her mother? asked that worthy gentleman.
Dead, said Toby.  Her mother got up linen; and was called to Heaven
when She was born.
Not to get up linen _there_, I suppose, remarked the Alderman
pleasantly.
Toby might or might not have been able to separate his wife in Heaven
from her old pursuits.  But query: If Mrs. Alderman Cute had gone to
Heaven, would Mr. Alderman Cute have pictured her as holding any state or
station there?
