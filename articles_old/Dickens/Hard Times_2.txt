This brought him to a stop.  Now, to think of these vagabonds, said he,
attracting the young rabble from a model school.
A space of stunted grass and dry rubbish being between him and the young
rabble, he took his eyeglass out of his waistcoat to look for any child
he knew by name, and might order off.  Phenomenon almost incredible
though distinctly seen, what did he then behold but his own metallurgical
Louisa, peeping with all her might through a hole in a deal board, and
his own mathematical Thomas abasing himself on the ground to catch but a
hoof of the graceful equestrian Tyrolean flower-act!
Dumb with amazement, Mr. Gradgrind crossed to the spot where his family
was thus disgraced, laid his hand upon each erring child, and said:
Louisa!!  Thomas!!
Both rose, red and disconcerted.  But, Louisa looked at her father with
more boldness than Thomas did.  Indeed, Thomas did not look at him, but
gave himself up to be taken home like a machine.
In the name of wonder, idleness, and folly! said Mr. Gradgrind, leading
each away by a hand; what do you do here?
Wanted to see what it was like, returned Louisa, shortly.
What it was like?
Yes, father.
There was an air of jaded sullenness in them both, and particularly in
the girl: yet, struggling through the dissatisfaction of her face, there
was a light with nothing to rest upon, a fire with nothing to burn, a
starved imagination keeping life in itself somehow, which brightened its
expression.  Not with the brightness natural to cheerful youth, but with
uncertain, eager, doubtful flashes, which had something painful in them,
analogous to the changes on a blind face groping its way.
She was a child now, of fifteen or sixteen; but at no distant day would
seem to become a woman all at once.  Her father thought so as he looked
at her.  She was pretty.  Would have been self-willed (he thought in his
eminently practical way) but for her bringing-up.
Thomas, though I have the fact before me, I find it difficult to believe
that you, with your education and resources, should have brought your
sister to a scene like this.
I brought _him_, father, said Louisa, quickly.  I asked him to come.
I am sorry to hear it.  I am very sorry indeed to hear it.  It makes
Thomas no better, and it makes you worse, Louisa.
She looked at her father again, but no tear fell down her cheek.
You!  Thomas and you, to whom the circle of the sciences is open; Thomas
and you, who may be said to be replete with facts; Thomas and you, who
have been trained to mathematical exactness; Thomas and you, here! cried
Mr. Gradgrind.  In this degraded position!  I am amazed.
I was tired, father.  I have been tired a long time, said Louisa.
Tired?  Of what? asked the astonished father.
I dont know of whatof everything, I think.
Say not another word, returned Mr. Gradgrind.  You are childish.  I
will hear no more.  He did not speak again until they had walked some
half-a-mile in silence, when he gravely broke out with: What would your
best friends say, Louisa?  Do you attach no value to their good opinion?
What would Mr. Bounderby say?  At the mention of this name, his daughter
stole a look at him, remarkable for its intense and searching character.
He saw nothing of it, for before he looked at her, she had again cast
down her eyes!
