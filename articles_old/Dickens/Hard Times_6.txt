There certainly is no reason in looking with interest at a parcel of
vagabonds, returned Bounderby.  When I was a vagabond myself, nobody
looked with any interest at _me_; I know that.
Then comes the question; said the eminently practical father, with his
eyes on the fire, in what has this vulgar curiosity its rise?
Ill tell you in what.  In idle imagination.
I hope not, said the eminently practical; I confess, however, that the
misgiving _has_ crossed me on my way home.
In idle imagination, Gradgrind, repeated Bounderby.  A very bad thing
for anybody, but a cursed bad thing for a girl like Louisa.  I should ask
Mrs. Gradgrinds pardon for strong expressions, but that she knows very
well I am not a refined character.  Whoever expects refinement in _me_
will be disappointed.  I hadnt a refined bringing up.
Whether, said Gradgrind, pondering with his hands in his pockets, and
his cavernous eyes on the fire, whether any instructor or servant can
have suggested anything?  Whether Louisa or Thomas can have been reading
anything?  Whether, in spite of all precautions, any idle story-book can
have got into the house?  Because, in minds that have been practically
formed by rule and line, from the cradle upwards, this is so curious, so
incomprehensible.
Stop a bit! cried Bounderby, who all this time had been standing, as
before, on the hearth, bursting at the very furniture of the room with
explosive humility.  You have one of those strollers children in the
school.
Cecilia Jupe, by name, said Mr. Gradgrind, with something of a stricken
look at his friend.
Now, stop a bit! cried Bounderby again.  How did she come there?
Why, the fact is, I saw the girl myself, for the first time, only just
now.  She specially applied here at the house to be admitted, as not
regularly belonging to our town, andyes, you are right, Bounderby, you
are right.
Now, stop a bit! cried Bounderby, once more.  Louisa saw her when she
came?
Louisa certainly did see her, for she mentioned the application to me.
But Louisa saw her, I have no doubt, in Mrs. Gradgrinds presence.
Pray, Mrs. Gradgrind, said Bounderby, what passed?
Oh, my poor health! returned Mrs. Gradgrind.  The girl wanted to come
to the school, and Mr. Gradgrind wanted girls to come to the school, and
Louisa and Thomas both said that the girl wanted to come, and that Mr.
Gradgrind wanted girls to come, and how was it possible to contradict
them when such was the fact!
Now I tell you what, Gradgrind! said Mr. Bounderby.  Turn this girl to
the right about, and theres an end of it.
I am much of your opinion.
Do it at once, said Bounderby, has always been my motto from a child.
When I thought I would run away from my egg-box and my grandmother, I did
it at once.  Do you the same.  Do this at once!
Are you walking? asked his friend.  I have the fathers address.
Perhaps you would not mind walking to town with me?
