                            SYLVIE AND BRUNO
                               CONCLUDED.
                               CHAPTER I.
                            BRUNOS LESSONS.
During the next month or two my solitary town-life seemed, by contrast,
unusually dull and tedious. I missed the pleasant friends I had left
behind at Elvestonthe genial interchange of thoughtthe sympathy which
gave to ones ideas a new and vivid reality: but, perhaps more than all,
I missed the companionship of the two Fairiesor Dream-Children, for I
had not yet solved the problem as to who or what they werewhose sweet
playfulness had shed a magic radiance over my life.
In office-hourswhich I suppose reduce most men to the mental condition
of a coffee-mill or a mangletime sped along much as usual: it was in
the pauses of life, the desolate hours when books and newspapers palled
on the sated appetite, and when, thrown back upon ones own dreary
musings, one stroveall in vainto people the vacant air with the dear
faces of absent friends, that the real bitterness of solitude made
itself felt.
One evening, feeling my life a little more wearisome than usual, I
strolled down to my Club, not so much with the hope of meeting any
friend there, for London was now out of town, as with the feeling that
here, at least, I should hear sweet words of human speech, and come
into contact with human thought.
However, almost the first face I saw there _was_ that of a friend. Eric
Lindon was lounging, with rather a bored expression of face, over a
newspaper; and we fell into conversation with a mutual satisfaction
which neither of us tried to conceal.
After a while I ventured to introduce what was just then the main
subject of my thoughts. And so the Doctor (a name we had adopted by a
tacit agreement, as a convenient compromise between the formality of
Doctor Forester and the intimacyto which Eric Lindon hardly seemed
entitledof Arthur) has gone abroad by this time, I suppose? Can you
give me his present address?
He is still at ElvestonI believe, was the reply. But I have not been
there since I last met you.
I did not know which part of this intelligence to wonder at most. And
might I askif it isnt taking too much of a libertywhen your
wedding-bells are toor perhaps they _have_ rung, already?
No, said Eric, in a steady voice, which betrayed scarcely a trace of
emotion: _that_ engagement is at an end. I am still Benedick the
_un_married man.
After this, the thick-coming fanciesall radiant with new possibilities
of happiness for Arthurwere far too bewildering to admit of any further
conversation, and I was only too glad to avail myself of the first
decent excuse, that offered itself, for retiring into silence.
The next day I wrote to Arthur, with as much of a reprimand for his long
silence as I could bring myself to put into words, begging him to tell
me how the world went with him.
Needs must that three or four dayspossibly moreshould elapse before I
could receive his reply; and never had I known days drag their slow
length along with a more tedious indolence.
