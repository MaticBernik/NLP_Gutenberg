FALK.
But what has this to do with Strawman, pray?
Is he a poem, or a Christian play?
MISS JAY [with tears of emotion].
No, Falk,--a man, with heart as large as day.
But when a--so to speak--mere lifeless thing
Can put such venom into envy's sting,
And stir up evil passions fierce and fell
Of such a depth--
FALK [sympathetically].
                  And such a length as well--
MISS JAY.
Why then, a man of your commanding brain
Can't fail to see--
FALK.
                    Oh, yes, that's very plain.
But hitherto I haven't quite made out
The nature, style, and plot of this romance.
It's something quite delightful I've no doubt--
But just a little inkling in advance--
STIVER.
I will abstract, in rapid _resume_,
The leading points.
MISS JAY.
                    No, I am more _au fait_,
I know the ins and outs--
MRS. HALM.
                          I know them too!
MISS JAY.
Oh Mrs. Halm! now let me tell it, do!
Well, Mr. Falk, you see--he passed at college
For quite a miracle of wit and knowledge,
Had admirable taste in books and dress--
MRS. HALM.
And acted--privately--with great success.
MISS JAY.
Yes, wait a bit--he painted, played and wrote--
MRS. HALM.
And don't forget his gift of anecdote.
MISS JAY.
Do give me time; I know the whole affair:
He made some verses, set them to an air,
Also his own,--and found a publisher.
O heavens! with what romantic melancholy
He played and sang his "Madrigals to Molly"!
MRS. HALM.
He was a genius, the simple fact.
GULDSTAD [to himself].
Hm!  Some were of opinion he was cracked.
FALK.
A gray old stager,(2)whose sagacious head
Was never upon mouldy parchments fed,
Says "Love makes Petrarchs, just as many lambs
And little occupation, Abrahams."
But who was Molly?
MISS JAY.
                   Molly?  His elect,
His lady-love, whom shortly we expect.
Of a great firm her father was a member--
GULDSTAD.
A timber house.
MISS JAY [curtly].
                I'm really not aware.
GULDSTAD.
Did a large trade in scantlings, I remember.
MISS JAY.
That is the trivial side of the affair.
FALK.
A firm?
MISS JAY [continuing].
        Of vast resources, I'm informed.
You can imagine how the suitors swarm'd;
Gentlemen of the highest reputation.--
MRS. HALM.
Even a baronet made application.
MISS JAY.
But Molly was not to be made their catch.
She had met Strawman upon private stages;
To see him was to love him--
FALK.
                             And despatch
The wooing gentry home without their wages?
MRS. HALM.
Was it not just a too romantic match?
MISS JAY.
And then there was a terrible old father,
Whose sport was thrusting happy souls apart;
She had a guardian also, as I gather,
To add fresh torment to her tortured heart.
But each of them was loyal to his vow;
A straw-hatched cottage and a snow-white ewe
They dream'd of, just enough to nourish two--
MRS. HALM.
Or at the very uttermost a cow,--
MISS JAY.
In short, I've heard it from the lips of both,--
A beck, a byre, two bosoms, and one troth.
