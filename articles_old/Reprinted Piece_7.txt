Said his sisters angel to the leader:
Is my brother come?
And he said, Not that one, but another.
As the child beheld his brothers angel in her arms, he cried, O,
sister, I am here!  Take me!  And she turned and smiled upon him, and
the star was shining.
He grew to be a young man, and was busy at his books when an old servant
came to him and said:
Thy mother is no more.  I bring her blessing on her darling son!
Again at night he saw the star, and all that former company.  Said his
sisters angel to the leader.
Is my brother come?
And he said, Thy mother!
A mighty cry of joy went forth through all the star, because the mother
was re-united to her two children.  And he stretched out his arms and
cried, O, mother, sister, and brother, I am here!  Take me!  And they
answered him, Not yet, and the star was shining.
He grew to be a man, whose hair was turning grey, and he was sitting in
his chair by the fireside, heavy with grief, and with his face bedewed
with tears, when the star opened once again.
Said his sisters angel to the leader: Is my brother come?
And he said, Nay, but his maiden daughter.
And the man who had been the child saw his daughter, newly lost to him, a
celestial creature among those three, and he said, My daughters head is
on my sisters bosom, and her arm is around my mothers neck, and at her
feet there is the baby of old time, and I can bear the parting from her,
GOD be praised!
And the star was shining.
Thus the child came to be an old man, and his once smooth face was
wrinkled, and his steps were slow and feeble, and his back was bent.  And
one night as he lay upon his bed, his children standing round, he cried,
as he had cried so long ago:
I see the star!
They whispered one another, He is dying.
And he said, I am.  My age is falling from me like a garment, and I move
towards the star as a child.  And O, my Father, now I thank thee that it
has so often opened, to receive those dear ones who await me!
And the star was shining; and it shines upon his grave.
OUR ENGLISH WATERING-PLACE
IN the Autumn-time of the year, when the great metropolis is so much
hotter, so much noisier, so much more dusty or so much more water-carted,
so much more crowded, so much more disturbing and distracting in all
respects, than it usually is, a quiet sea-beach becomes indeed a blessed
spot.  Half awake and half asleep, this idle morning in our sunny window
on the edge of a chalk-cliff in the old-fashioned watering-place to which
we are a faithful resorter, we feel a lazy inclination to sketch its
picture.
The place seems to respond.  Sky, sea, beach, and village, lie as still
before us as if they were sitting for the picture.  It is dead low-water.
A ripple plays among the ripening corn upon the cliff, as if it were
faintly trying from recollection to imitate the sea; and the world of
butterflies hovering over the crop of radish-seed are as restless in
their little way as the gulls are in their larger manner when the wind
blows.  But the ocean lies winking in the sunlight like a drowsy lionits
glassy waters scarcely curve upon the shorethe fishing-boats in the tiny
harbour are all stranded in the mudour two colliers (our watering-place
has a maritime trade employing that amount of shipping) have not an inch
of water within a quarter of a mile of them, and turn, exhausted, on
their sides, like faint fish of an antediluvian species.  Rusty cables
and chains, ropes and rings, undermost parts of posts and piles and
confused timber-defences against the waves, lie strewn about, in a brown
litter of tangled sea-weed and fallen cliff which looks as if a family of
giants had been making tea here for ages, and had observed an untidy
custom of throwing their tea-leaves on the shore.
