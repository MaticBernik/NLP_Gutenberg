PAROLLES.
That, having this obtain'd, you presently
Attend his further pleasure.
HELENA.
In everything I wait upon his will.
PAROLLES.
I shall report it so.
HELENA.
I pray you.--Come, sirrah.
[Exeunt.]
SCENE 5.  Another room in the same.
[Enter LAFEU and BERTRAM.]
LAFEU.
But I hope your lordship thinks not him a soldier.
BERTRAM.
Yes, my lord, and of very valiant approof.
LAFEU.
You have it from his own deliverance.
BERTRAM.
And by other warranted testimony.
LAFEU.
Then my dial goes not true: I took this lark for a bunting.
BERTRAM.
I do assure you, my lord, he is very great in knowledge,
and accordingly valiant.
LAFEU.
I have, then, sinned against his experience and transgressed
against his valour; and my state that way is dangerous, since I
cannot yet find in my heart to repent. Here he comes; I pray you
make us friends; I will pursue the amity
[Enter PAROLLES.]
PAROLLES.
[To BERTRAM.] These things shall be done, sir.
LAFEU.
Pray you, sir, who's his tailor?
PAROLLES.
Sir!
LAFEU.
O, I know him well, I, sir; he, sir, is a good workman, a
very good tailor.
BERTRAM.
[Aside to PAROLLES.] Is she gone to the king?
PAROLLES.
She is.
BERTRAM.
Will she away to-night?
PAROLLES.
As you'll have her.
BERTRAM.
I have writ my letters, casketed my treasure,
Given order for our horses; and to-night,
When I should take possession of the bride,
End ere I do begin.
LAFEU.
A good traveller is something at the latter end of a dinner;
but one that lies three-thirds and uses a known truth to pass a
thousand nothings with, should be once heard and thrice beaten.--
God save you, Captain.
BERTRAM.
Is there any unkindness between my lord and you, monsieur?
PAROLLES.
I know not how I have deserved to run into my lord's displeasure.
LAFEU.
You have made shift to run into 't, boots and spurs and all,
like him that leapt into the custard; and out of it you'll run
again, rather than suffer question for your residence.
BERTRAM.
It may be you have mistaken him, my lord.
LAFEU.
And shall do so ever, though I took him at his prayers.
Fare you well, my lord; and believe this of me, there can be no
kernal in this light nut; the soul of this man is his clothes;
trust him not in matter of heavy consequence; I have kept of them
tame, and know their natures.--Farewell, monsieur; I have spoken
better of you than you have or will to deserve at my hand; but we
must do good against evil.
[Exit.]
PAROLLES.
An idle lord, I swear.
BERTRAM.
I think so.
PAROLLES.
Why, do you not know him?
BERTRAM.
Yes, I do know him well; and common speech
Gives him a worthy pass. Here comes my clog.
[Enter HELENA.]
HELENA.
I have, sir, as I was commanded from you,
Spoke with the king, and have procur'd his leave
For present parting; only he desires
Some private speech with you.
