_All._  Our duty to your Honour.   _Exeunt._
_Ham._ Your loue, as mine to you: farewell.           [Sidenote: loves,]
My Fathers Spirit in Armes?[6] All is not well:
[Sidenote: 30,52] I doubt some foule play: would the Night were come;
Till then sit still my soule; foule deeds will rise,
                                                [Sidenote: fonde deedes]
Though all the earth orewhelm them to mens eies.
                                           _Exit._

white.]
[Footnote 2: The colour of sable-fur, I think.]
[Footnote 3: Hamlet does not _accept_ the Appearance as his father; he
thinks it may be he, but seems to take a usurpation of his form for very
possible.]
[Footnote 4: _1st Q_. 'tenible']
[Footnote 5: If _treble_ be the right word, the actor in uttering it
must point to each of the three, with distinct yet rapid motion. The
phrase would be a strange one, but not unlike Shakspere. Compare
_Cymbeline_, act v. sc. 5: 'And your three motives to the battle,'
meaning 'the motives of you three.' Perhaps, however, it is only the
adjective for the adverb: '_having concealed it hitherto, conceal it
trebly now_.' But _tenible_ may be the word: 'let it be a thing to be
kept in your silence still.']
[Footnote 6: Alone, he does not dispute _the idea_ of its being his
father.]

_SCENA TERTIA_[1]
_Enter Laertes and Ophelia_.           [Sidenote: _Ophelia his Sister._]
_Laer_. My necessaries are imbark't; Farewell:     [Sidenote: inbarckt,]
And Sister, as the Winds giue Benefit,
And Conuoy is assistant: doe not sleepe,
                                    [Sidenote: conuay, in assistant doe]
But let me heare from you.
_Ophel_. Doe you doubt that?
_Laer_. For _Hamlet_, and the trifling of his fauours,
                                                     [Sidenote: favour,]
Hold it a fashion and a toy in Bloud;
A Violet in the youth of Primy Nature;
Froward,[2] not permanent; sweet not lasting
The suppliance of a minute? No more.[3]
                                  [Sidenote: The perfume and suppliance]
_Ophel_. No more but so.[4]
_Laer_. Thinke it no more.
For nature cressant does not grow alone,
[Sidenote: 172] In thewes[5] and Bulke: but as his Temple waxes,[6]
                                         [Sidenote: bulkes, but as this]
The inward seruice of the Minde and Soule
Growes wide withall. Perhaps he loues you now,[7]
And now no soyle nor cautell[8] doth besmerch
The vertue of his feare: but you must feare
                                            [Sidenote: of his will, but]
His greatnesse weigh'd, his will is not his owne;[9]    [Sidenote: wayd]
For hee himselfe is subiect to his Birth:[10]
Hee may not, as vnuallued persons doe,
Carue for himselfe; for, on his choyce depends
The sanctity and health of the weole State.
                                  [Sidenote: The safty and | this whole]
And therefore must his choyce be circumscrib'd[11]
Vnto the voyce and yeelding[12] of that Body,
Whereof he is the Head. Then if he sayes he loues you,
It fits your wisedome so farre to beleeue it;
As he in his peculiar Sect and force[13]
                                [Sidenote: his particuler act and place]
May giue his saying deed: which is no further,
[Footnote 1: _Not in Quarto_.]
[Footnote 2: Same as _forward_.]
