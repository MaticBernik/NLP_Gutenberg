You see, we must give up the "Cakes" now, or our cupboard will
be of no use to us.  We must take, as our 'Universe', some class
of things which will include Dragons and Scotchmen: shall we say
'Animals'?  And, as "canny" is evidently the Attribute belonging
to the 'Middle Terms', we will let m stand for "canny", x for
"Dragons", and y for "Scotchmen".  So that our two Premisses are,
in full,
   "All Dragon-Animals are uncanny (Animals);
   All Scotchman-Animals are canny (Animals)."
And these may be expressed, using letters for words, thus:--
                "All x are m';
                 All y are m."
The first Premiss consists, as you already know, of two parts:--
                 "Some x are m',"
             and "No x are m."
And the second also consists of two parts:--
                 "Some y are m,"
             and "No y are m'."
Let us take the negative portions first.
We have, then, to mark, on the larger Diagram, first, "no x are
m", and secondly, "no y are m'".  I think you will see, without
further explanation, that the two results, separately, are
       -----------           -----------
      |     |     |         |0    |     |
      |   --|--   |         |   --|--   |
      |  |0 | 0|  |         |  |  |  |  |
      |--|--|--|--|         |--|--|--|--|
      |  |  |  |  |         |  |  |  |  |
      |   --|--   |         |   --|--   |
      |     |     |         |0    |     |
       -----------           -----------
and that these two, when combined, give us
                    -----------
                   |0    |     |
                   |   --|--   |
                   |  |0 | 0|  |
                   |--|--|--|--|
                   |  |  |  |  |
                   |   --|--   |
                   |0    |     |
                    -----------
We have now to mark the two positive portions, "some x are m'"
and "some y are m".
The only two compartments, available for Things which are xm', are
No. 9 and No. 10.  Of these, No. 9 is already marked as 'empty';
so our red counter must go into No. 10.
Similarly, the only two, available for ym, are No. 11 and No. 13.
Of these, No. 11 is already marked as 'empty'; so our red counter
MUST go into No. 13.
The final result is
                    -----------
                   |0    |    1|
                   |   --|--   |
                   |  |0 | 0|  |
                   |--|--|--|--|
                   |  |1 |  |  |
                   |   --|--   |
                   |0    |     |
                    -----------
And now how much of this information can usefully be transferred
to the smaller Diagram?
Let us take its four compartments, one by one.
As to No. 5?  This, we see, is wholly 'empty'. (So mark it with a
grey counter.)
As to No. 6?  This, we see, is 'occupied'.  (So mark it with a red
counter.)
As to No. 7?  Ditto, ditto.
As to No. 8?  No information.
The smaller Diagram is now pretty liberally marked:--
                     -------
                    | 0 | 1 |
                    |---|---|
                    | 1 |   |
                     -------
And now what Conclusion can we read off from this?  Well, it is
impossible to pack such abundant information into ONE Proposition:
we shall have to indulge in TWO, this time.
First, by taking x as Subject, we get "all x are y'", that is,
