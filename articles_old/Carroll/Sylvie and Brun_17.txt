Yes, I think I will, Arthur began; but at that moment we came into
sight of Lady Muriel, and he checked himself. No, its too far round.
Yet it certainly _would_ be cooler He stood, hesitating, looking
first one way and then the othera melancholy picture of utter infirmity
of purpose!
How long this humiliating scene would have continued, if _I_ had been
the only external influence, it is impossible to say; for at this moment
Sylvie, with a swift decision worthy of Napoleon himself, took the
matter into her own hands. You go and drive _her_, up this way, she
said to Bruno. Ill get _him_ along! And she took hold of the stick
that Arthur was carrying, and gently pulled him down the lane.
He was totally unconscious that any will but his own was acting on the
stick, and appeared to think it had taken a horizontal position simply
because he was pointing with it. Are not those _orchises_ under the
hedge there? he said. I think that decides me. Ill gather some as I
go along.
[Illustration: ARE NOT THOSE ORCHISES?]
Meanwhile Bruno had run on beyond Lady Muriel, and, with much jumping
about and shouting (shouts audible to no one but Sylvie and myself),
much as if he were driving sheep, he managed to turn her round and make
her walk, with eyes demurely cast upon the ground, in our direction.
The victory was ours! And, since it was evident that the lovers, thus
urged together, _must_ meet in another minute, I turned and walked on,
hoping that Sylvie and Bruno would follow my example, as I felt sure
that the fewer the spectators the better it would be for Arthur and his
good angel.
And what sort of meeting was it? I wondered, as I paced dreamily on.
                              CHAPTER IV.
                             THE DOG-KING.
They shooked hands, said Bruno, who was trotting at my side, in answer
to the unspoken question.
And they looked _ever_ so pleased! Sylvie added from the other side.
Well, we must get on, now, as quick as we can, I said. If only I knew
the best way to Hunters farm!
Theyll be sure to know in this cottage, said Sylvie.
Yes, I suppose they will. Bruno, would you run in and ask?
Sylvie stopped him, laughingly, as he ran off. Wait a minute, she
said. I must make you _visible_ first, you know.
And _audible_ too, I suppose? I said, as she took the jewel, that hung
round her neck, and waved it over his head, and touched his eyes and
lips with it.
Yes, said Sylvie: and _once_, do you know, I made him _audible_, and
forgot to make him _visible_! And he went to buy some sweeties in a
shop. And the man _was_ so frightened! A voice seemed to come out of the
air, Please, I want two ounces of barley-sugar drops! And a shilling
came _bang_ down upon the counter! And the man said I cant _see_
you! And Bruno said It doosnt sinnify seeing _me_, so long as oo can
see the _shilling_! But the man said he never sold barley-sugar drops
to people he couldnt _see_. So we had to_Now_, Bruno, youre ready!
And away he trotted.
