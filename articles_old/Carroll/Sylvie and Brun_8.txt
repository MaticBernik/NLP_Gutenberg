[Illustration: SPEND IT ALL FOR MINNIE]
The whole scene now returned vividly to my memory; and, to make this
repetition of it stranger still, there was the same old man, whom I
remembered seeing so roughly ordered off, by the Station-Master, to make
room for his titled passenger. The same, but with a difference: no
longer tottering feebly along the platform, but actually seated at Lady
Muriels side, and in conversation with her! Yes, put it in your
purse, she was saying, and remember youre to spend it all for
_Minnie_. And mind you bring her something nice, thatll do her real
good! And give her my love! So intent was she on saying these words,
that, although the sound of my footstep had made her lift her head and
look at me, she did not at first recognise me.
I raised my hat as I approached, and then there flashed across her face
a genuine look of joy, which so exactly recalled the sweet face of
Sylvie, when last we met in Kensington Gardens, that I felt quite
bewildered.
Rather than disturb the poor old man at her side, she rose from her
seat, and joined me in my walk up and down the platform, and for a
minute or two our conversation was as utterly trivial and commonplace as
if we were merely two casual guests in a London drawing-room. Each of us
seemed to shrink, just at first, from touching on the deeper interests
which linked our lives together.
The Elveston train had drawn up at the platform, while we talked; and,
in obedience to the Station-Masters obsequious hint of This way, my
Lady! Times up!, we were making the best of our way towards the end
which contained the sole first-class carriage, and were just passing the
now-empty bench, when Lady Muriel noticed, lying on it, the purse in
which her gift had just been so carefully bestowed, the owner of which,
all unconscious of his loss, was being helped into a carriage at the
other end of the train. She pounced on it instantly. Poor old man! she
cried. He mustnt go off, and think hes lost it!
Let _me_ run with it! I can go quicker than you! I said. But she was
already half-way down the platform, flying (running is much too
mundane a word for such fairy-like motion) at a pace that left all
possible efforts of _mine_ hopelessly in the rear.
She was back again before I had well completed my audacious boast of
speed in running, and was saying, quite demurely, as we entered our
carriage, and you really think _you_ could have done it quicker?
No indeed! I replied. I plead Guilty of gross exaggeration, and
throw myself on the mercy of the Court!
The Court will overlook itfor this once! Then her manner suddenly
changed from playfulness to an anxious gravity.
You are not looking your best! she said with an anxious glance. In
fact, I think you look _more_ of an invalid than when you left us. I
very much doubt if London agrees with you?
