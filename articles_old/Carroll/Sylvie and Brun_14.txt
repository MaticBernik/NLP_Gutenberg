Might not the Socialists reply Much of this money does not represent
_honest_ labour _at all_. If you could trace it back, from owner to
owner, though you might begin with several legitimate steps, such as
gift, or bequeathing by will, or value received, you would soon reach
an owner who had no moral right to it, but had got it by fraud or other
crimes; and of course his successors in the line would have no better
right to it than _he_ had.
No doubt, no doubt, Arthur replied. But surely that involves the
logical fallacy of _proving too much_? It is _quite_ as applicable to
_material_ wealth, as it is to _money_. If we once begin to go back
beyond the fact that the _present_ owner of certain property came by it
honestly, and to ask whether any previous owner, in past ages, got it by
fraud, would _any_ property be secure?
After a minutes thought, I felt obliged to admit the truth of this.
My general conclusion, Arthur continued, from the mere standpoint of
human _rights_, man against man, was thisthat if some wealthy idle
mouth, who has come by his money in a lawful way, even though not one
atom of the labour it represents has been his own doing, chooses to
spend it on his own needs, without contributing any labour to the
community from whom he buys his food and clothes, that community has no
_right_ to interfere with him. But its quite another thing, when we
come to consider the _divine_ law. Measured by _that_ standard, such a
man is undoubtedly doing wrong, if he fails to use, for the good of
those in need, the strength or the skill, that God has given him. That
strength and skill do _not_ belong to the community, to be paid to
_them_ as a _debt_: they do _not_ belong to the man _himself_, to be
used for his _own_ enjoyment: they _do_ belong to God, to be used
according to _His_ will; and we are not left in doubt as to what that
will is. _Do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again._
Anyhow, I said, an idle mouth very often gives away a great deal in
charity.
In _so-called_ charity, he corrected me. Excuse me if I seem to
speak _un_charitably. I would not dream of _applying_ the term to any
_individual_. But I would say, _generally_, that a man who gratifies
every fancy that occurs to himdenying himself in _nothing_and merely
gives to the poor some part, or even _all_, of his _superfluous_ wealth,
is only deceiving himself if he calls it _charity_.
But, even in giving away _superfluous_ wealth, he _may_ be denying
himself the misers pleasure in hoarding?
I grant you that, gladly, said Arthur. Given that he _has_ that
morbid craving, he is doing a good deed in restraining it.
But, even in spending on _himself_, I persisted, our typical rich man
often does good, by employing people who would otherwise be out of work:
and that is often better than pauperising them by _giving_ the money.
