In the second case (when, for example, the Premisses are "no
m are x'" and "all m' are y") the two Terms, which contain these
contradictory Attributes, may be called 'THE MIDDLE TERMS'.
Thus, in the first case, the class of "m-Things" is the Middle
Term; and, in the second case, the two classes of "m-Things" and
"m'-Things" are the Middle Terms.
The Attribute, which occurs in the Middle Term or Terms, disappears
in the Conclusion, and is said to be "eliminated", which literally
means "turned out of doors".
Now let us try to draw a Conclusion from the two Premisses--
          "Some new Cakes are unwholesome;
           No nice Cakes are unwholesome."
In order to express them with counters, we need to divide Cakes in
THREE different ways, with regard to newness, to niceness, and to
wholesomeness.  For this we must use the larger Diagram, making x
mean "new", y "nice", and m "wholesome".  (Everything INSIDE the
central Square is supposed to have the attribute m, and everything
OUTSIDE it the attribute m', i.e. "not-m".)
You had better adopt the rule to make m mean the Attribute which
occurs in the MIDDLE Term or Terms.  (I have chosen m as the symbol,
because 'middle' begins with 'm'.)
Now, in representing the two Premisses, I prefer to begin with the
NEGATIVE one (the one beginning with "no"), because GREY counters
can always be placed with CERTAINTY, and will then help to fix the
position of the red counters, which are sometimes a little uncertain
where they will be most welcome.
Let us express, the "no nice Cakes are unwholesome (Cakes)", i.e.
"no y-Cakes are m'-(Cakes)".  This tells us that none of the Cakes
belonging to the y-half of the cupboard are in its m'-compartments
(i.e. the ones outside the central Square).  Hence the two compartments,
No. 9 and No. 15, are both 'EMPTY'; and we must place a grey counter
in EACH of them, thus:--
                    -----------
                   |0    |     |
                   |   --|--   |
                   |  |  |  |  |
                   |--|-----|--|
                   |  |  |  |  |
                   |   --|--   |
                   |0    |     |
                    -----------
We have now to express the other Premiss, namely, "some new Cakes
are unwholesome (Cakes)", i.e.  "some x-Cakes are m'-(Cakes)".  This
tells us that some of the Cakes in the x-half of the cupboard are
in its m'-compartments.  Hence ONE of the two compartments, No.
9 and No. 10, is 'occupied': and, as we are not told in WHICH of
these two compartments to place the red counter, the usual rule
would be to lay it on the division-line between them: but, in this
case, the other Premiss has settled the matter for us, by declaring
No. 9 to be EMPTY.  Hence the red counter has no choice, and MUST
go into No. 10, thus:--
                    -----------
                   |0    |    1|
                   |   --|--   |
                   |  |  |  |  |
                   |--|-----|--|
                   |  |  |  |  |
                   |   --|--   |
                   |0    |     |
                    -----------
And now what counters will this information enable us to place in
the SMALLER Diagram, so as to get some Proposition involving x and
y only, leaving out m?  Let us take its four compartments, one by
one.
