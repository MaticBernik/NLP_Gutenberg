FOLDAL.
  I can guess whom you mean.
BORKMAN.
  There was not a nook or cranny of my life that I hesitated
to lay open to him.  And then, when the moment came, he turned
against me the weapons I myself had placed in his hands.
FOLDAL.
  I have never been able to understand why he----  Of course,
there were whispers of all sorts at the time.
BORKMAN.
  What were the whispers?  Tell me.  You see I know nothing.
For I had to go straight into--into isolation.  What did people
whisper, Vilhelm?
FOLDAL.
  You were to have gone into the Cabinet, they said.
BORKMAN.
  I was offered a portfolio, but I refused it.
FOLDAL.
  Then it wasn't there you stood in his way?
BORKMAN.
  Oh, no; that was not the reason he betrayed me.
FOLDAL.
  Then I really can't understand----
BORKMAN.
  I may as well tell you, Vilhelm----
FOLDAL.
  Well?
BORKMAN.
  There was--in fact, there was a woman in the case.
FOLDAL.
  A woman in the case?  Well but, John Gabriel----
BORKMAN.
  [Interrupting.]  Well, well--let us say no more of these stupid
old stories.  After all, neither of us got into the Cabinet,
neither he nor I.
FOLDAL.
  But he rose high in the world.
BORKMAN.
  And I fell into the abyss.
FOLDAL.
  Oh, it's a terrible tragedy----
BORKMAN.
  [Nodding to him.]  Almost as terrible as yours, I fancy, when
I come to think of it.
FOLDAL.
  [Naively.]  Yes, at least as terrible.
BORKMAN.
  [Laughing quietly.]  But looked at from another point of view,
it is really a sort of comedy as well.
FOLDAL.
  A comedy?  The story of your life?
BORKMAN.
  Yes, it seems to be taking a turn in that direction.  For let
me tell you----
FOLDAL.
  What?
BORKMAN.
  You say you did not meet Frida as you came in?
FOLDAL.
  No.
BORKMAN.
  At this moment, as we sit here, she is playing waltzes for the
guests of the man who betrayed and ruined me.
FOLDAL.
  I hadn't the least idea of that.
BORKMAN.
  Yes, she took her music, and went straight from me to--to the
great house.
FOLDAL.
  [Apologetically.]  Well, you see, poor child----
BORKMAN.
  And can you guess for whom she is playing--among the rest?
FOLDAL.
  No.
BORKMAN.
  For my son.
FOLDAL.
  What?
BORKMAN.
  What do you think of that, Vilhelm?  My son is down there in
the whirl of the dance this evening.  Am I not right in calling
it a comedy?
FOLDAL.
  But in that case you may be sure he knows nothing about it.
BORKMAN.
  What does he know?
FOLDAL.
  You may be sure he doesn't know how he--that man----
BORKMAN.
  Do not shrink from his name.  I can quite well bear it now.
FOLDAL.
  I'm certain your son doesn't know the circumstances, John Gabriel.
BORKMAN.
  [Gloomily, sitting and beating the table.]  Yes, he knows, as
surely as I am sitting here.
FOLDAL.
  Then how can he possibly be a guest in that house?
BORKMAN.
  [Shaking his head.]  My son probably does not see things with
my eyes.  I'll take my oath he is on my enemies' side!  No doubt
he thinks, as they do, that Hinkel only did his confounded duty
when he went and betrayed me.
