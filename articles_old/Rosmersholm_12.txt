Rosmer (getting up quickly). Kroll!
Rebecca. Mr. Kroll! What a surprise!
Mrs. Helseth. He asks if he may come up and speak to Mr. Rosmer.
Rosmer (to REBECCA). What did I say! (To MRS. HELSETH). Of course he
may. (Goes to the door and calls down the stairs.) Come up, my dear
fellow! I am delighted to see you! (He stands holding the door open.
MRS. HELSETH goes out. REBECCA draws the curtain over the doorway at
the back, and then begins to tidy the room. KROLL comes in with his hat
in his hand.)
Rosmer (quietly, and with some emotion). I knew quite well it would not
be the last time--
Kroll. To-day I see the matter in quite a different light from
yesterday.
Rosmer. Of course you do, Kroll! Of course you do! You have been
thinking things over--
Kroll. You misunderstand me altogether. (Puts his hat down on the
table.) It is important that I should speak to you alone.
Rosmer. Why may not Miss West--?
Rebecca. No, no, Mr. Rosmer. I will go.
Kroll (looking meaningly at her). And I see I ought to apologise to
you, Miss West, for coming here so early in the morning. I see I have
taken you by surprise, before you have had time to--
Rebecca (with a start). Why so? Do you find anything out of place in
the fact of my wearing a morning wrapper at home here?
Kroll. By no means! Besides, I have no knowledge of what customs may
have grown up at Rosmersholm.
Rosmer. Kroll, you are not the least like yourself to-day.
Rebecca. I will wish you good morning, Mr. Kroll. (Goes out to the
left.)
Kroll. If. you will allow me-- (Sits down on the couch.)
Rosmer. Yes, my dear fellow, let us make ourselves comfortable and have
a confidential talk. (Sits down on a chair facing KROLL.)
Kroll. I have not been able to close an eye since yesterday. I lay all
night, thinking and thinking.
Rosmer. And what have you got to say to-day?
Kroll. It will take me some time, Rosmer. Let me begin with a sort of
introduction. I can give you some news of Ulrick Brendel.
Rosmer. Has he been to see you?
Kroll. No. He took up his quarters in a low-class tavern--in the lowest
kind of company, of course; drank, and stood drinks to others, as long
as he had any money left; and then began to abuse the whole lot of them
as a contemptible rabble--and, indeed, as far as that goes he was quite
right. But the result was, that he got a thrashing and was thrown out
into the gutter.
Rosmer. I see he is altogether incorrigible.
Kroll. He had pawned the coat you gave him, too, but that is going to
be redeemed for him. Can you guess by whom?
Rosmer. By yourself, perhaps?
Kroll. No. By our noble friend Mr. Mortensgaard.
Rosmer. Is that so?
Kroll. I am informed that Mr. Brendel's first visit was paid to the
"idiot" and  "plebeian".
