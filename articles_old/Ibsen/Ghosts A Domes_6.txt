Oswald (going towards the conservatory). I haven't done so much
painting just lately.
Mrs. Alving. An artist must take a rest sometimes, like other people.
Manders. Of course, of course. At those times the artist is preparing
and strengthening himself for a greater effort.
Oswald. Yes. Mother, will dinner soon be ready?
Mrs. Alving. In half an hour. He has a fine appetite, thank goodness.
Manders. And a liking for tobacco too.
Oswald. I found father's pipe in the room upstairs, and--
Manders. Ah, that is what it was!
Mrs. Alving. What?
Manders. When Oswald came in at that door with the pipe in his mouth, I
thought for the moment it was his father in the flesh.
Oswald. Really?
Mrs. Alving. How can you say so! Oswald takes after me.
Manders. Yes, but there is an expression about the corners of his
mouth--something about the lips--that reminds me so exactly of Mr.
Alving--especially when he smokes.
Mrs. Alving. I don't think so at all. To my mind, Oswald has much more
of a clergyman's mouth.
Menders. Well, yes--a good many of my colleagues in the church have a
similar expression.
Mrs. Alving. But put your pipe down, my dear boy. I don't allow any
smoking in here.
Oswald (puts down his pipe). All right, I only wanted to try it,
because I smoked it once when I was a child.
Mrs. Alving. You?
Oswald. Yes; it was when I was quite a little chap. And I can remember
going upstairs to father's room one evening when he was in very good
spirits.
Mrs. Alving. Oh, you can't remember anything about those days.
Oswald. Yes, I remember plainly that he took me on his knee and let me
smoke his pipe. "Smoke, my boy," he said, "have a good smoke, boy!" And
I smoked as hard as I could, until I felt I was turning quite pale and
the perspiration was standing in great drops on my forehead. Then he
laughed--such a hearty laugh.
Manders. It was an extremely odd thing to do.
Mrs. Alving. Dear Mr. Manders, Oswald only dreamt it.
Oswald. No indeed, mother, it was no dream. Because--don't you
remember--you came into the room and carried me off to the nursery,
where I was sick, and I saw that you were crying. Did father often play
such tricks?
Manders. In his young days he was full of fun--
Oswald. And, for all that, he did so much with his life--so much that
was good and useful, I mean--short as his life was.
Manders. Yes, my dear Oswald Alving, you have inherited the name of a
man who undoubtedly was both energetic and worthy. Let us hope it will
be a spur to your energies.
Oswald. It ought to be, certainly.
Manders. In any case it was nice of you to come home for the day that
is to honour his memory.
Oswald. I could do no less for my father.
Mrs. Alving. And to let me keep him so long here--that's the nicest
part of what he has done.
