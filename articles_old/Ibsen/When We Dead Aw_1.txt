PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Short, repellently.] All the world knows nothing! Understands nothing!
MAIA.
Well, at any rate it can divine something--
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Something that isn't there at all, yes. Something that never was in my
mind. Ah yes, that they can all go into ecstasies over! [Growling to
himself.] What is the good of working oneself to death for the mob and
the masses--for "all the world"!
MAIA.
Do you think it is better, then--do you think it is worthy of you, to do
nothing at all but portrait-bust now and then?
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[With a sly smile.] They are not exactly portrait-busts that I turn out,
Maia.
MAIA.
Yes, indeed they are--for the last two or three years--ever since you
finished your great group and got it out of the house--
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
All the same, they are no mere portrait-busts, I assure you.
MAIA.
What are they, then?
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
There is something equivocal, something cryptic, lurking in and behind
these busts--a secret something, that the people themselves cannot see--
MAIA.
Indeed?
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Decisively.] I alone can see it. And it amuses me unspeakably.--On the
surface I give them the "striking likeness," as they call it, that they
all stand and gape at in astonishment--[Lowers his voice]--but at bottom
they are all respectable, pompous horse-faces, and self-opinionated
donkey-muzzles, and lop-eared, low-browed dog-skulls, and fatted
swine-snouts--and sometimes dull, brutal bull-fronts as well--
MAIA.
[Indifferently.] All the dear domestic animals, in fact.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Simply the dear domestic animals, Maia. All the animals which men have
bedevilled in their own image--and which have bedevilled men in return.
[Empties his champagne-glass and laughs.] And it is these double-faced
works of art that our excellent plutocrats come and order of me. And
pay for in all good faith--and in good round figures too--almost their
weight in gold, as the saying goes.
MAIA.
[Fills his glass.] Come, Rubek! Drink and be happy.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Passes his hand several times across his forehead and leans back in his
chair.] I am happy, Maia. Really happy--in a way. [Short silence.]
For after all there is a certain happiness in feeling oneself free and
independent on every hand--in having at ones command everything one can
possibly wish for--all outward things, that is to say. Do you not agree
with me, Maia?
MAIA.
Oh yes, I agree. All that is well enough in its way. [Looking at
him.] But do you remember what you promised me the day we came to an
understanding on--on that troublesome point--
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Nods.] --on the subject of our marriage, yes. It was no easy matter for
you, Maia.
MAIA.
[Continuing unruffled.] --and agreed that I was to go abroad with you,
and live there for good and all--and enjoy myself.--Do you remember what
you promised me that day?
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Shaking his head.] No, I can't say that I do. Well, what did I promise?
MAIA.
You said you would take me up to a high mountain and show me all the
glory of the world.
