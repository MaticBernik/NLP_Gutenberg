MRS. BORKMAN.
  Only my sister, who has just arrived from----
    [ERHART BORKMAN flings the half-open door wide open and rushes
        in.  He is a young man with bright cheerful eyes.  He is
        well dressed; his moustache is beginning to grow.
ERHART.
  [Radiant with joy; on the threshold.]  What is this!  Is Aunt
Ella here?  [Rushing up to her and seizing her hands.]  Aunt,
aunt!  Is it possible?  Are you here?
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Throws her arms round his neck.]  Erhart!  My dear, dear boy!
Why, how big you have grown!  Oh, how good it is to see you again!
MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Sharply.]  What does this mean, Erhart?  Were you hiding out in
the hallway?
MRS. WILTON.
  [Quickly.]  Erhart--Mr. Borkman came in with me.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Looking hard at him.]  Indeed, Erhart!  You don't come to your
mother first?
ERHART.
  I had just to look in at Mrs. Wilton's for a moment--to call
for little Frida.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  Is that Miss Foldal with you too?
MRS. WILTON.
  Yes, we have left her in the hall.
ERHART.
  [Addressing some one through the open door.]  You can go right
upstairs, Frida.
    [Pause.  ELLA RENTHEIM observes ERHART.  He seems embarrassed
        and a little impatient; his face has assumed a nervous and
        colder expression.
    [THE MAID brings the lighted lamp into the garden-room, goes
        out again and closes the door behind her.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  [With forced politeness.]  Well, Mrs. Wilton, if you will give
us the pleasure of your company this evening, won't you----
MRS. WILTON.
  Many thanks, my dear lady, but I really can't.  We have another
invitation.  We're going down to the Hinkels'.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Looking at her.]  We?  Whom do you mean by we?
MRS. WILTON.
  [Laughing.]  Oh, I ought really to have said I.  But I was
commissioned by the ladies of the house to bring Mr. Borkman
with me--if I happened to see him.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  And you did happen to see him, it appears.
MRS. WILTON.
  Yes, fortunately.  He was good enough to look in at my house--
to call for Frida.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Drily.]  But, Erhart, I did not know that you knew that family--
those Hinkels?
ERHART.
  [Irritated.]  No, I don't exactly know them.  [Adds rather
impatiently.]  You know better than anybody, mother, what people
I know and don't know.
MRS. WILTON.
  Oh, it doesn't matter!  They soon put you at your ease in that
house!  They are such cheerful, hospitable people--the house swarms
with young ladies.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  [With emphasis.]  If I know my son rightly, Mrs. Wilton, they
are no fit company for him.
MRS. WILTON.
  Why, good gracious, dear lady, he is young, too, you know!
MRS. BORKMAN.
  Yes, fortunately he's young.  He would need to be young.
ERHART.
  [Concealing his impatience.]  Well, well, well, mother, it's
quite clear I can't got to the Hinkels' this evening.  Of course
I shall remain here with you and Aunt Ella.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  I knew you would, my dear Erhart.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  No, Erhart, you must not stop at home on my account----
