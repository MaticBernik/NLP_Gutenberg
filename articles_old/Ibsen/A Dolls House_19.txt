_Nora_. Torvald.
_Helmer_. Yes.
_Nora_. If your little squirrel were to ask you for something very, very
prettily--?
_Helmer_. What then?
_Nora_. Would you do it?
_Helmer_. I should like to hear what it is, first.
_Nora_. Your squirrel would run about and do all her tricks if you would
be nice, and do what she wants.
_Helmer_. Speak plainly.
_Nora_. Your skylark would chirp about in every room, with her song
rising and falling--
_Helmer_. Well, my skylark does that anyhow.
_Nora_. I would play the fairy and dance for you in the moonlight,
Torvald.
_Helmer_. Nora--you surely don't mean that request you made of me this
morning?
_Nora_ (_going near him_). Yes, Torvald, I beg you so earnestly--
_Helmer_. Have you really the courage to open up that question again?
_Nora_. Yes, dear, you _must_ do as I ask; you _must_ let Krogstad keep
his post in the bank.
_Helmer_. My dear Nora, it is his post that I have arranged Mrs. Linde
shall have.
_Nora._ Yes, you have been awfully kind about that; but you could just
as well dismiss some other clerk instead of Krogstad.
_Helmer._ This is simply incredible obstinacy! Because you chose to give
him a thoughtless promise that you would speak for him, I am expected
to--
_Nora._ That isn't the reason, Torvald. It is for your own sake. This
fellow writes in the most scurrilous newspapers; you have told me so
yourself. He can do you an unspeakable amount of harm. I am frightened
to death of him--
_Helmer._ Ah, I understand; it is recollections of the past that scare
you.
_Nora._ What do you mean?
_Helmer._ Naturally you are thinking of your father.
_Nora._ Yes--yes, of course. Just recall to your mind what these
malicious creatures wrote in the papers about papa, and how horribly
they slandered him. I believe they would have procured his dismissal if
the Department had not sent you over to inquire into it, and if you had
not been so kindly disposed and helpful to him.
_Helmer._ My little Nora, there is an important difference between your
father and me. Your father's reputation as a public official was not
above suspicion. Mine is, and I hope it will continue to be so, as long
as I hold my office.
_Nora._ You never can tell what mischief these men may contrive. We
ought to be so well off, so snug and happy here in our peaceful home,
and have no cares--you and I and the children, Torvald! That is why I
beg you so earnestly--
_Helmer_. And it is just by interceding for him that you make it
impossible for me to keep him. It is already known at the Bank that I
mean to dismiss Krogstad. Is it to get about now that the new manager
has changed his mind at his wife's bidding--
_Nora_. And what if it did?
_Helmer_. Of course!--if only this obstinate little person can get her
way! Do you suppose I am going to make myself ridiculous before my whole
staff, to let people think that I am a man to be swayed by all sorts of
outside influence? I should very soon feel the consequences of it, I can
tell you. And besides, there is one thing that makes it quite impossible
for me to have Krogstad in the bank as long as I am manager.
