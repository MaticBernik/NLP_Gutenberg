FOLDAL.
  [Shaking his head.]  Never lying, John Gabriel.
BORKMAN.
  Have you not sat here feeding me with hope, and trust, and
confidence--that was all a lie?
FOLDAL.
  It wasn't a lie so long as you believed in my vocation.  So long
as you believed in me, I believed in you.
BORKMAN.
  Then we have been all the time deceiving each other.  And perhaps
deceiving ourselves--both of us.
FOLDAL.
  But isn't that just the essence of friendship, John Gabriel?
BORKMAN.
  [Smiling bitterly.]  Yes, you are right there.  Friendship
means--deception.  I have learnt that once before.
FOLDAL.
  [Looking at him.]  I have no poetic vocation!  And you could
actually say it to me so bluntly.
BORKMAN.
  [In a gentler tone.]  Well, you know, I don't pretend to know
much about these matters.
FOLDAL.
  Perhaps you know more than you think.
BORKMAN.
  I?
FOLDAL.
  [Softly.]  Yes, you.  For I myself have had my doubts, now and
then, I may tell you.  The horrible doubt that I may have bungled
my life for the sake of a delusion.
BORKMAN.
  If you have no faith in yourself, you are on the downward path
indeed.
FOLDAL.
  That was why I found such comfort in coming here to lean upon
your faith in me.  [Taking his hat.]  But now you have become a
stranger to me.
BORKMAN.
  And you to me.
FOLDAL.
  Good night, John Gabriel.
BORKMAN.
  Good night, Vilhelm.
    [Foldal goes out to the left.
    [BORKMAN stands for a moment gazing at the closed door; makes
        a movement as though to call FOLDAL back, but changes his
        mind, and begins to pace the floor with his hands behind
        his back.  Then he stops at the table beside the sofa and
        puts out the lamp.  The room becomes half dark.  After a
        short pause, there comes a knock at the tapestry door.
BORKMAN.
  [At the table, starts, turns, and asks in a loud voice:]  Who is
that knocking?
    [No answer, another knock.
BORKMAN.
  [Without moving.]  Who is it?  Come in!
    [ELLA RENTHEIM, with a lighted candle in her hand, appears in
        the doorway.  She wears her black dress, as before, with
        her cloak thrown loosely round her shoulders.
BORKMAN.
  [Staring at her.]  Who are you?  What do you want with me?
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Closes the door and advances.]  It is I, Borkman.
     [She puts down the candle on the piano and remains standing
         beside it.
BORKMAN.
  [Stands as though thunderstruck, stares fixedly at her, and says
in a half-whisper.]  Is it--is it Ella?  Is it Ella Rentheim?
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Yes, it's "your" Ella, as you used to call me in the old days;
many, many years ago.
BORKMAN.
  [As before.]  Yes, it is you Ella, I can see you now.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Can you recognise me?
BORKMAN.
  Yes, now I begin to----
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  The years have told on me, and brought winter with them, Borkman.
Do you not think so?
BORKMAN.
  [In a forced voice.]  You are a good deal changed--just at first
glance.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  There are no dark curls on my neck now--the curls you once loved
to twist round your fingers.
