ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Eagerly.]  Redeem yourself!  What do you mean by that?
MRS. BORKMAN.
  Redeem my name, and honour, and fortune!  Redeem my ruined life--
that is what I mean!  I have some one in reserve, let me tell you--
one who will wash away every stain that he has left.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Gunhild!  Gunhild!
MRS. BORKMAN.
  [With rising excitement.]  There is an avenger living, I tell
you!  One who will make up to me for all his father's sins!
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Erhart you mean.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  Yes, Erhart, my own boy!  He will redeem the family, the house,
the name.  All that can be redeemed.--And perhaps more besides.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  And how do you think that is to be done?
MRS. BORKMAN.
  It must be done as best it can; I don't know how.  But I know
that it must and shall be done.  [Looks searchingly at her.]  Come
now, Ella; isn't that really what you have had in mind too, ever
since he was a child?
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  No, I can't exactly say that.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  No?  Then why did you take charge of him when the storm broke
upon--upon this house?
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  You could not look after him yourself at that time, Gunhild.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  No, no, I could not.  And his father--he had a valid enough
excuse--while he was there--in safe keeping----
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Indignant.]  Oh, how can you say such things!--You!
MRS. BORKMAN.
  [With a venomous expression.]  And how could you make up your
mind to take charge of the child of a--a John Gabriel!  Just as
if he had been your own?  To take the child away from me--home
with you--and keep him there year after year, until the boy was
nearly grown up.  [Looking suspiciously at her.]  What was your
real reason, Ella?  Why did you keep him with you?
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  I came to love him so dearly----
MRS. BORKMAN.
  More than I--his mother?
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Evasively.]  I don't know about that.  And then, you know,
Erhart was rather delicate as a child----
MRS. BORKMAN.
  Erhart--delicate!
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Yes, I thought so--at that time at any rate.  And you know the
air of the west coast is so much milder than here.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Smiling bitterly.]  H'm--is it indeed?  [Breaking off.]  Yes,
it is true you have done a great deal for Erhart.  [With a change
of tone.]  Well, of course, you could afford it.  [Smiling.]  You
were so lucky, Ella; you managed to save all your money.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Hurt.]  I did not manage anything about it, I assure you.  I
had no idea--until long, long afterwards--that the securities
belonging to me--that they had been left untouched.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  Well, well; I don't understand anything about these things!  I
only say you were lucky.  [Looking inquiringly at her.]  But when
you, of your own accord, undertook to educate Erhart for me--what
was your motive in that?
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Looking at her.]  My motive?
MRS. BORKMAN.
  Yes, some motive you must have had.  What did you want to do
with him?  To make of him, I mean?
