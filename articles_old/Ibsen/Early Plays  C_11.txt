[He hands him the purse with the gold.]
THE SOLDIER.  [Rising.]
O gracious lord,--dare I believe your words?
CATILINE.  Yes; but be quick, old man; go free your son.
[The SOLDIER goes hurriedly out.]
CATILINE.  A better use,--not so, Aurelia dear?--
Than bribery and purchasing of votes?
Noble it is to crush the tyrant's might;
Yet quiet solace too has its reward.
AURELIA.  [Throws herself in his arms.]
Oh, rich and noble is your spirit still.
Yes,--now I know my Catiline again.
                *       *       *       *       *
[An underground tomb with a freshly walled-in passage
high on the rear wall.  A lamp burns faintly.]
[FURIA, in long black robes, is standing in the tomb
as if listening.]
FURIA.  A hollow sound.  'Tis thunder rolls above.
I hear its rumble even in the tomb.
Yet is the tomb itself so still--so still!
Am I forever damned to drowsy rest?
Never again am I to wander forth
By winding paths, as ever was my wish?
FURIA.  [After a pause.]
A strange, strange life it was;--as strange a fate.
Meteor-like all came--and disappeared.
He met me.  A mysterious magic force,
An inner harmony, together drew us.
I was his Nemesis;--and he my victim;--
Yet punishment soon followed the avenger.
FURIA.  [Another pause.]
Now daylight rules the earth.--Am I perchance
To slip--unknowing--from the realm of light?
'Tis well, if so it be,--if this delay
Within the tomb be nothing but a flight
Upon the wings of lightning into Hades,--
If I be nearing even now the Styx!
There roll the leaden billows on the shore;
There silently old Charon plies his boat.
Soon am I there!  Then shall I seat myself
Beside the ferry,--question every spirit,
Each fleeting shadow from the land of life,
As light of foot he nears the river of death,--
Shall ask each one in turn how Catiline
Fares now among the mortals of the earth,--
Shall ask each one how he has kept his oath.
I shall illumine with blue sulphur light
Each spectral countenance and hollow eye,--
To ascertain if it be Catiline.
And when he comes, then shall I follow him;--
Together we shall make the journey hence,
Together enter Pluto's silent hall.
I too a shadow shall his shade pursue;--
Where Catiline is, must Furia also be!
FURIA.  [After a pause, more faintly.]
The air is growing close and clammy here,--
And every breath in turn more difficult.--
Thus am I drawing near the gloomy swamps,
Where creep the rivers of the underworld.
FURIA.  [She listens; a dull noise is heard.]
A muffled sound?  'Tis like the stroke of oars.
It is the ferryman of shades who comes
To take me hence.  No, here--here will I wait!
[The stones in the freshly walled-in passage are broken asunder.
CURIUS comes into view on the outside; he beckons to her.]
FURIA.  Ah, greetings, Charon!  Are you ready now
To lead me hence, a guest among the spirits?
Here will I wait!
CURIUS.  [Whispering.]  I come to set you free!
