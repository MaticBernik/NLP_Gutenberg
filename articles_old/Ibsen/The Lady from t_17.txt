Wangel (humouring her). Maybe. But even if it were true, what then?
Ellida (in lower voice, and coming nearer). I have seen such eyes
before.
Wangel. Well? Where?
Ellida. Out at Bratthammeren, ten years ago.
Wangel (stepping back). What does it mean?
Ellida (whispers, trembling). The child had the strange man's eyes.
Wangel (cries out reluctantly). Ellida!
Ellida (clasps her hands despairingly about her head). Now you
understand why I would not, why I dared not, live with you as your wife.
(She turns suddenly and rushes off over the heights.)
Wangel (hurrying after her and calling). Ellida, Ellida! My poor unhappy
Ellida!
ACT III
(SCENE.--A more remote part of DOCTOR WANGEL'S garden. It is boggy and
overshadowed by large old trees. To the right is seen the margin of a
dank pond. A low, open fence separates the garden from the footpath, and
the fjord in the background. Beyond is the range of mountains, with its
peaks. It is afternoon, almost evening. BOLETTE sits on a stone seat,
and on the seat lie some books and a work-basket. HILDE and LYNGSTRAND,
both with fishing-tackle, walk along the bank of the pond.)
Hilde (making a sign to LYNGSTRAND). I can see a large one.
Lyngstrand (looking). Where?
Hilde (pointing). Can't you see? He's down there. Good gracious! There's
another! (Looks through the trees.) Out there. Now he's coming to
frighten him away!
Bolette (looking up). Who's coming?
Hilde. Your tutor, Miss!
Bolette. Mine?
Hilde. Yes. Goodness knows he never was mine.
(ARNHOLM enters from between the trees.)
Arnholm. Are there fish in the pond now?
Hilde. There are some very ancient carp.
Arnholm. No! Are the old carp still alive?
Hilde. Yes; they're pretty tough. But now we're going to try and get rid
of some of them.
Arnholm. You'd better try out there at the fjord.
Lyngstrand. No; the pond is--well--so to say--more mysterious.
Hilde. Yes; it's fascinating here. Have you been in the sea?
Arnholm. Yes; I've come straight from the baths.
Hilde. I suppose you kept in the enclosure?
Arnholm. Yes; I'm not much of a swimmer.
Hilde. Can you swim on your back?
Arnholm. No.
Hilde. I can. (To LYNGSTRAND.) Let's try out there on the other side.
(They go off along the pond.)
Arnholm (coming closer to BOLETTE). Are you sitting all alone here,
Bolette?
Bolette. Yes; I generally do.
Arnholm. Isn't your mother down here in the garden?
Bolette. No--she's sure to be out with father.
Arnholm. How is she this afternoon?
Bolette. I don't quite know. I forgot to ask.
Arnholm. What books have you there?
Bolette. The one's something about botany. And the other's a geography.
Arnholm. Do you care about such things?
Bolette. Yes, if only I had time for it. But, first of all, I've to look
after the housekeeping.
Arnholm. Doesn't your mother help you--your stepmother--doesn't she help
with that?
Bolette. No, that's my business. Why, I saw to that during the two years
father was alone. And so it has been since.
