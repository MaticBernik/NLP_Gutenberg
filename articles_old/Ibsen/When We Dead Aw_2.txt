PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[With a slight start.] Did I promise you that, too?
MAIA.
Me too? Who else, pray?
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Indifferently.] No, no, I only meant did I promise to show you--?
MAIA. --all the glory of the world? Yes, you did. And all that glory
should be mine, you said.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
That is sort of figure of speech that I was in the habit of using once
upon a time.
MAIA.
Only a figure of speech?
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Yes, a schoolboy phrase--the sort of thing I used to say when I wanted
to lure the neighbours' children out to play with me, in the woods and
on the mountains.
MAIA.
[Looking hard at him.] Perhaps you only wanted to lure me out to play,
as well?
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Passing it off as a jest.] Well, has it not been a tolerable amusing
game, Maia?
MAIA.
[Coldly.] I did not go with you only to play.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
No, no, I daresay not.
MAIA.
And you never took me up with you to any high mountain, or showed me--
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[With irritation.] --all the glory of the world? No, I did not. For, let
me tell you something: you are not really born to be a mountain-climber,
little Maia.
MAIA.
[Trying to control herself.] Yet at one time you seemed to think I was.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Four or five years ago, yes. [Stretching himself in his chair.] Four or
five years--it's a long, long time, Maia.
MAIA.
[Looking at him with a bitter expression.] Has the time seemed so very
long to you, Rubek?
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
I am beginning now to find it a trifle long. [Yawning.] Now and then,
you know.
MAIA.
[Returning to her place.] I shall not bore you any longer.
      [She resumes her seat, takes up the newspaper, and begins turning
       over the leaves.  Silence on both sides.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Leaning on his elbows across the table, and looking at her teasingly.]
Is the Frau Professor offended?
MAIA.
[Coldly, without looking up.] No, not at all.
    [Visitors to the baths, most of them ladies, begin to pass,
       singly and in groups, through the park from the right, and
       out to the left.
    [Waiters bring refreshments from the hotel, and go off behind
       the pavilion.
    [The INSPECTOR, wearing gloves and carrying a stick, comes from
       his rounds in the park, meets visitors, bows politely, and
       exchanges a few words with some of them.
THE INSPECTOR.
[Advancing to PROFESSOR RUBEK's table and politely taking off his hat.]
I have the honour to wish you good morning, Mrs. Rubek.--Good morning,
Professor Rubek.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Good morning, good morning Inspector.
THE INSPECTOR.
[Addressing himself to MRS. RUBEK.] May I venture to ask if you have
slept well?
MAIA.
Yes, thank you; excellently--for my part. I always sleep like a stone.
THE INSPECTOR.
I am delighted to hear it. The first night in a strange place is often
rather trying.--And the Professor--?
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Oh, my night's rest is never much to boast of--especially of late.
