ALLMERS. And yet you used to be so fond of Eyolf.
RITA. I was so sorry for him--because you troubled yourself so little
about him. You kept him reading and grinding at books. You scarcely even
saw him.
ALLMERS. [Nodding slowly.] No; I was blind. The time had not yet come
for me--
RITA. [Looking in his face.] But now, I suppose, it has come?
ALLMERS. Yes, at, last. Now I see that the highest task I can have in
the world is to be a true father to Eyolf.
RITA. And to me?--what will you be to me?
ALLMERS. [Gently.] I will always go on caring for you--with calm, deep
tenderness. [ He tries to take her hands.]
RITA. [Evading him.] I don't care a bit for your calm, deep tenderness.
I want you utterly and entirely--and alone! Just as I had you in the
first rich, beautiful days. [Vehemently and harshly.] Never, never will
I consent to be put off with scraps and leavings, Alfred!
ALLMERS. [In a conciliatory tone.] I should have thought there was
happiness in plenty for all three of us, Rita.
RITA. [Scornfully.] Then you are easy to please. [Seats herself at the
table on the left.] Now listen to me.
ALLMERS. [Approaching.] Well, what is it?
RITA. [Looking up at him with a veiled glow in her eyes.] When I got
your telegram yesterday evening--
ALLMERS. Yes? What then?
RITA.--then I dressed myself in white--
ALLMERS. Yes, I noticed you were in white when I arrived.
RITA. I had let down my hair--
ALLMERS. Your sweet masses of hair--
RITA.--so that it flowed down my neck and shoulders--
ALLMERS. I saw it, I saw it. Oh, how lovely you were, Rita!
RITA. There were rose-tinted shades over both the lamps. And we were
alone, we two--the only waking beings in the whole house. And there was
champagne on the table.
ALLMERS. I did not drink any of it.
RITA. [Looking bitterly at him.] No, that is true. [Laughs harshly.]
"There stood the champagne, but you tasted it not"--as the poet says.
[She rises from the armchair, goes with an air of weariness over to the
sofa, and seats herself, half reclining, upon it.]
ALLMERS. [Crosses the room and stands before her.] I was so taken up
with serious thoughts. I had made up my mind to talk to you of our
future, Rita--and first and foremost of Eyolf.
RITA. [Smiling.] And so you did--
ALLMERS. No, I had not time to--for you began to undress.
RITA. Yes, and meanwhile you talked about Eyolf. Don't you remember? You
wanted to know all about little Eyolf's digestion.
ALLMERS. [Looking reproachfully at her.] Rita--!
RITA. And then you got into your bed, and slept the sleep of the just.
ALLMERS. [Shaking his head.] Rita--Rita!
RITA. [Lying at full length and looking up at him.] Alfred?
ALLMERS. Yes?
RITA. "There stood your champagne, but you tasted it not."
ALLMERS. [Almost harshly.] No. I did not taste it.
