[Sadly.] Yes, I did.
HEDDA.
Let me see--about how long ago was that?
MRS. ELVSTED.
My marriage?
HEDDA.
Yes.
MRS. ELVSTED.
Five years ago.
HEDDA.
To be sure; it must be that.
MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh those five years--! Or at all events the last two or three of them!
Oh, if you(6) could only imagine--
HEDDA.
[Giving her a little slap on the hand.] De? Fie, Thea!
MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes, yes, I will try--. Well, if--you could only imagine and
understand--
HEDDA.
[Lightly.] Eilert Lovborg has been in your neighbourhood about three
years, hasn't he?
MRS. ELVSTED.
[Looks at here doubtfully.] Eilert Lovborg? Yes--he has.
HEDDA.
Had you known him before, in town here?
MRS. ELVSTED.
Scarcely at all. I mean--I knew him by name of course.
HEDDA.
But you saw a good deal of him in the country?
MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes, he came to us every day. You see, he gave the children lessons; for
in the long run I couldn't manage it all myself.
HEDDA.
No, that's clear.--And your husband--? I suppose he is often away from
home?
MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes. Being sheriff, you know, he has to travel about a good deal in his
district.
HEDDA.
[Leaning against the arm of the chair.] Thea--my poor, sweet Thea--now
you must tell me everything--exactly as it stands.
MRS. ELVSTED.
Well, then you must question me.
HEDDA.
What sort of a man is your husband, Thea? I mean--you know--in everyday
life. Is he kind to you?
MRS. ELVSTED.
[Evasively.] I am sure he means well in everything.
HEDDA.
I should think he must be altogether too old for you. There is at least
twenty years' difference between you, is there not?
MRS. ELVSTED.
[Irritably.] Yes, that is true, too. Everything about him is repellent
to me! We have not a thought in common. We have no single point of
sympathy--he and I.
HEDDA.
But is he not fond of you all the same? In his own way?
MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh I really don't know. I think he regards me simply as a useful
property. And then it doesn't cost much to keep me. I am not expensive.
HEDDA.
That is stupid of you.
MRS. ELVSTED.
[Shakes her head.] It cannot be otherwise--not with him. I don't think
he really cares for any one but himself--and perhaps a little for the
children.
HEDDA.
And for Eilert Lovborg, Thea?
MRS. ELVSTED.
[Looking at her.] For Eilert Lovborg? What puts that into your head?
HEDDA.
Well, my dear--I should say, when he sends you after him all the way
to town-- [Smiling almost imperceptibly.] And besides, you said so
yourself, to Tesman.
MRS. ELVSTED.
[With a little nervous twitch.] Did I? Yes, I suppose I did.
[Vehemently, but not loudly.] No--I may just as well make a clean breast
of it at once! For it must all come out in any case.
HEDDA.
Why, my dear Thea--?
MRS. ELVSTED.
Well, to make a long story short: My husband did not know that I was
coming.
