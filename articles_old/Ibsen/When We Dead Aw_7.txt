    [The SISTER OF MERCY comes out of the hotel with a tray on which
       is bread and milk.  She places it on the table outside the
       pavilion, which she enters.
ULFHEIM.
[Laughs scornfully.] That stuff there--is that what you call food for
human beings! Milk and water and soft, clammy bread. Ah, you should see
my comrades feeding. Should you like to see it?
MAIA.
[Smiling across to the PROFESSOR and rising.] Yes, very much.
ULFHEIM.
[Also rising.] Spoken like a woman of spirit, madam! Come with me, then!
They swallow whole great thumping meat-bones--gulp them up and then gulp
them down again. Oh, it's a regular treat to see them. Come along and
I'll show you--and while we're about it, we can talk over this trip to
the mountains--
    [He goes out by the corner of the hotel, MAIA following him.
    [Almost at the same moment the STRANGE LADY comes out of the
       pavilion and seats herself at the table.
    [The LADY raises her glass of milk and is about to drink, but
       stops and looks across at RUBEK with vacant, expressionless
       eyes.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Remains sitting at his table and gazes fixedly and earnestly at her.
At last he rises, goes some steps towards her, stops, and says in a low
voice.] I know you quite well, Irene.
THE LADY.
[In a toneless voice, setting down her glass.] You can guess who I am,
Arnold?
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Without answering.] And you recognise me, too, I see.
THE LADY.
With you it is quite another matter.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
With me?--How so?
THE LADY.
Oh, you are still alive.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Not understanding.] Alive--?
THE LADY.
[After a short pause.] Who was the other? The woman you had with
you--there at the table?
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[A little reluctantly.] She? That was my--my wife.
THE LADY.
[Nods slowly.] Indeed. That is well, Arnold. Some one, then, who does
not concern me--
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Nods.] No, of course not--
THE LADY. --one whom you have taken to you after my lifetime.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Suddenly looking hard at her.] After your--? What do you mean by that,
Irene?
IRENE.
[Without answering.] And the child? I hear the child is prospering too.
Our child survives me--and has come to honour and glory.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Smiles as at a far-off recollection.] Our child? Yes, we called it
so--then.
IRENE.
In my lifetime, yes.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Trying to take a lighter tone.] Yes, Irene.--I can assure you "our
child" has become famous all the wide world over. I suppose you have
read about it.
IRENE.
[Nods.] And has made its father famous too.--That was your dream.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[More softly, with emotion.] It is to you I owe everything, everything,
Irene--and I thank you.
IRENE.
[Lost in thought for a moment.] If I had then done what I had a right to
do, Arnold--
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Well? What then?
IRENE.
I should have killed that child.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Killed it, you say?
IRENE.
[Whispering.] Killed it--before I went away from you. Crushed
it--crushed it to dust.
