ALLMERS. Those, of course, you must keep yourself.
ASTA. [With an effort.] No; I am determined that you shall look through
them, too, Alfred. Some time--later on in life. I haven't the key of the
portfolio with me just now.
ALLMERS. It doesn't matter, my dear Asta, for I shall never read your
mother's letters in any case.
ASTA. [Fixing her eyes on him.] Then some time or other--some quiet
evening--I will tell you a little of what is in them.
ALLMERS. Yes, that will be much better. But do you keep your mother's
letters--you haven't so many mementos of her.
[He hands ASTA the portfolio. She takes it, and lays it on the chair
under her outdoor things. RITA comes into the room again.]
RITA. Ugh! I feel as if that horrible old woman had brought a sort of
graveyard smell with her.
ALLMERS. Yes, she was rather horrible.
RITA. I felt almost sick while she was in the room.
ALLMERS. However, I can very well understand the sort of spellbound
fascination that she talked about. The loneliness of the mountain-peaks
and of the great waste places has something of the same magic about it.
ASTA. [Looks attentively at him.] What is it that has happened to you,
Alfred?
ALLMERS. [Smiling.] To me?
ASTA. Yes, something has happened--something seems almost to have
transformed you. Rita noticed it too.
RITA. Yes, I saw it the moment you came. A change for the better, I
hope, Alfred?
ALLMERS. It ought to be for the better. And it must and shall come to
good.
RITA. [With an outburst.] You have had some adventure on your journey!
Don't deny it! I can see it in your face!
ALLMERS. [Shaking his head.] No adventure in the world--outwardly at
least. But--
RITA. [Eagerly.] But--?
ALLMERS. It is true that within me there has been something of a
revolution.
RITA. Oh Heavens--!
ALLMERS. [Soothingly, patting her hand.] Only for the better, my dear
Rita. You may be perfectly certain of that.
RITA. [Seats herself on the sofa.] You must tell us all about it, at
once--tell us everything!
ALLMERS. [Turning to ASTA.] Yes, let us sit down, too, Asta. Then I will
try to tell you as well as I can.
[He seats himself on the sofa at RITA's side. ASTA moves a chair
forward, and places herself near him.]
RITA. [Looking at him expectantly.] Well--?
ALLMERS. [Gazing straight before him.] When I look back over my
life--and my fortunes--for the last ten or eleven years, it seems to me
almost like a fairy-tale or a dream. Don't you think so too, Asta?
ASTA. Yes, in many ways I think so.
ALLMERS. [Continuing.] When I remember what we two used to be, Asta--we
two poor orphan children--
RITA. [Impatiently.] Oh, that is such an old, old story.
ALLMERS. [Not listening to her.] And now here I am in comfort and
luxury. I have been able to follow my vocation. I have been able to work
and study--just as I had always longed to. [Holds out his hand.] And all
this great--this fabulous good fortune we owe to you, my dearest Rita.
