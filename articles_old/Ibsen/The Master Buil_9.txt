DR. HERDAL.
What have you seen?
SOLNESS.
[In a low voice, slowly.] That you have been quietly keeping an eye upon
me.
DR. HERDAL.
That _I_ have! And why in all the world should I do that?
SOLNESS.
Because you think that I----  [Passionately.]  Well devil take it--you
think the same of me as Aline does.
DR. HERDAL.
And what does she think about you?
SOLNESS.
[Having recovered his self-control.] She has begun to think that I
am--that I am--ill.
DR. HERDAL.
Ill! You! She has never hinted such a thing to me. Why, what can she
think is the matter with you?
SOLNESS.
[Leans over the back of the chair and whispers.] Aline has made up her
mind that I am mad. That is what she thinks.
DR. HERDAL.
[Rising.] Why, my dear fellow--!
SOLNESS.
Yes, on my soul she does! I tell you it is so. And she has got you to
think the same! Oh, I can assure you, doctor, I see it in your face as
clearly as possible. You don't take me in so easily, I can tell you.
DR. HERDAL.
[Looks at him in amazement.] Never, Mr. Solness--never has such a
thought entered my mind.
SOLNESS.
[With and incredulous smile.] Really? Has it not?
DR. HERDAL.
No, never! Nor your wife's mind either, I am convinced. I could almost
swear to that.
SOLNESS.
Well, I wouldn't advise you to. For, in a certain sense, you see,
perhaps--perhaps she is not so far wrong in thinking something of the
kind.
DR. HERDAL.
Come now, I really must say--
SOLNESS.
[Interrupting, with a sweep of his hand.] Well, well, my dear
doctor--don't let us discuss this any further. We had better agree
to differ. [Changes to a tone of quiet amusement.] But look here now,
doctor--h'm--
DR. HERDAL.
Well?
SOLNESS.
Since you don't believe that I am--ill--and crazy--and mad, and so
forth--
DR. HERDAL.
What then?
SOLNESS.
Then I daresay you fancy that I am an extremely happy man.
DR. HERDAL.
Is that mere fancy?
SOLNESS.
[Laughs.] No, no--of course not! Heaven forbid! Only think--to be
Solness the master builder! Halvard Solness! What could be more
delightful?
DR. HERDAL.
Yes, I must say it seems to me you have had the luck on your side to an
astounding degree.
SOLNESS.
[Suppresses a gloomy smile.] So I have. I can't complain on that score.
DR. HERDAL.
First of all that grim old robbers' castle was burnt down for you. And
that was certainly a great piece of luck.
SOLNESS.
[Seriously.] It was the home of Aline's family. Remember that.
DR. HERDAL.
Yes, it must have been a great grief to her.
SOLNESS.
She has not got over it to this day--not in all these twelve or thirteen
years.
DR. HERDAL.
But you--yourself--you rose upon the ruins. You began as a poor boy from
a country village--and now you are at the head of your profession. Ah,
yes, Mr. Solness, you have undoubtedly had the luck on your side.
