<U+202D>  FINIS LIBRI PRIMI HOM. ODYSS.
<U+202D>[1] The information or fashion of an absolute man; and necessary (or
<U+202D>fatal) passage through many afflictions (according with the most
<U+202D>Sacred Letter) to his natural haven and country, is the whole
<U+202D>argument and scope of this inimitable and miraculous poem. And
<U+202D>therefore is the epithet _<U+03C0><U+03BF><U+03BB><U+1F50><U+03C4><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03C0><U+03BF><U+03BD>_ given him in the first verse:
<U+202D>_<U+03C0><U+03BF><U+03BB><U+1F50><U+03C4><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03C0><U+03BF><U+03C2>_ signifying, _Homo cujus ingenium velut per multas
<U+202D>et varias vias vertitur in verum._
<U+202D>[2] These notes following I am forced to insert (since the words
<U+202D>they contain differ from all other translations) lest I be thought to
<U+202D>err out of that ignorance that may perhaps possess my depraver.
<U+202D>[3] _<U+0391>µ<U+1F51>µ<U+03BF><U+03BD><U+03BF><U+03C2>_ translated in this place _inculpabilis,_ and made
<U+202D>the epithet of Agisthus, is from the true sense of the word, as it is
<U+202D>here to be understood; which is quite contrary.  As _<U+1F70><U+03BD><U+03C4><U+1F77><U+03B8><U+03B5><U+03BF><U+03C2>_ is
<U+202D>to be expounded in some place _Divinus,_ or _Deo similis,_ but in
<U+202D>another (soon after) _contrarius Deo._  The person to whom the
<U+202D>epithet is given giving reason to distinguish it.  And so
<U+202D>_<U+1F40><U+03BB><U+03BF><U+1F41><U+03C6><U+03C1><U+03C9><U+03BD>,_ an epithet given to Atlas, instantly following, in one
<U+202D>place signifies _mente perniciosus,_ in the next, _qui universa
<U+202D>mente gerit._
<U+202D>[4] In this place is Atlas given the epithet _<U+1F40><U+03BB><U+03BF><U+1F41><U+03C6><U+03C1><U+03C9><U+03BD>,_ which
<U+202D>signifies _qui universa mente agitat,_ here given him for the power
<U+202D>the stars have in all things.  Yet this receives other interpretation in
<U+202D>other places, as abovesaid.
<U+202D>[5] _<U+0394><U+1F50><U+03C3><U+03C4><U+03B7><U+03BD><U+03BF><U+03C2>_ is here turned by others, _infelix,_ in the general
<U+202D>collection; when it hath here a particular exposition, applied to
<U+202D>express Ulysses desert errors, _<U+03C0><U+03B1><U+03C1><U+1F01> <U+03C4><U+1F41> <U+03C3><U+03C4><U+1F23><U+03BD><U+03B1><U+03B9>, ut sit, qui vix
<U+202D>locum invenire potest ubi consistat._
<U+202D>[6] This is thus translated, the rather to express and approve the
<U+202D>allegory driven through the whole Odysseys.  Deciphering the
<U+202D>intangling of the wisest in his affections; and the torments that
<U+202D>breed in every pious mind; to be thereby hindered to arrive so
<U+202D>directly as he desires, at the proper and only true natural country
<U+202D>of every worthy man, whose haven is heaven and the next life, to
<U+202D>which, this life is but a sea in continual asture and vexation.  The
<U+202D>words occasioning all this are _µ<U+03B1><U+03BB><U+03B1><U+03BA><U+03BF><U+1F33><U+03C2> <U+03BB><U+1F40><U+03BB><U+03BF><U+03B9><U+03C2>: µ<U+03B1><U+03BB><U+03B1><U+03BA><U+1F40><U+03C2>_
<U+202D>signifying, _qui languide, et animo remisso rem aliquam gerit;_
<U+202D>which being the effect of Calypsos sweet words in Ulysses, is here
<U+202D>applied passively to his own sufferance of their operation.
<U+202D>[7] _<U+1FDE><U+0395><U+03C1><U+03BA><U+03BF><U+03C2> <U+1F40><U+03B4><U+1F40><U+03BD><U+03C4><U+03C9><U+03BD>,_ viz.  _vallum_ or _clanstrum dentium,_
<U+202D>which, for the better sound in our language, is here turned, Pale of
<U+202D>Ivory.  The teeth being that rampire, or pale, given us by nature in
<U+202D>that part for restraint and compression of our speech, till the
<U+202D>imagination, appetite, and soul (that ought to rule in their
<U+202D>examination, before their delivery) have given worthy pass to
<U+202D>them.  The most grave and divine poet, teaching therein, that not so
<U+202D>much for the necessary chewing of our sustenance our teeth are
<U+202D>given us, as for their stay of our words, lest we utter them rashly.
<U+202D>[8] _<U+03A4><U+1F40><U+03C3><U+03BF><U+03C2> <U+03C0><U+03B1>î<U+03C2>, Tantus filius._  Pallas thus enforcing her question
<U+202D>to stir up the son the more to the fathers worthiness.
