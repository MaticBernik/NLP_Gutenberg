SCENE II.--EASTCHEAP, LONDON.
    _Enter BARDOLPH,(I) NYM, PISTOL, MRS. QUICKLY, and BOY, L.2 E._
_Quick._ (L.C.) Pr'ythee, honey-sweet husband, let me bring thee to
Staines.[17]
  _Pist._ (C.) No; for my manly heart doth yearn.--
  Bardolph, be blithe;--Nym, rouse thy vaunting veins;
  Boy, bristle thy courage up; for Falstaff he is dead,
  And we must yearn therefore.
_Bard._ (R.) 'Would I were with him, wheresome'er he is!
_Quick._ (C.) Sure, he's in Arthur's bosom,[18] if ever man went to
Arthur's bosom. 'A made a finer end,[19] and went away, an it had been
any christom child;[20] 'a parted even just between twelve and one, e'en
at turning o' the tide:[21] for after I saw him fumble with the
sheets,[22] and play with flowers, and smile upon his fingers' ends,
I knew there was but one way; for his nose was as sharp as a pen, and a'
babbled of green fields. How now, Sir John! quoth I: what, man! be of
good cheer. So a' cried out--Heaven, Heaven, Heaven! three or four
times. Now I, to comfort him, bid him 'a should not think of Heaven;
I hoped, there was no need to trouble himself with any such thoughts
yet. So 'a bade me lay more clothes on his feet: I put my hand into the
bed and felt them, and they were as cold as any stone.
_Nym._ (R.C.) They say he cried out of sack.
_Quick._ Ay, that 'a did.
_Bard._ And of women.
_Quick._ Nay, that 'a did not.
_Boy._ (L.) Yes, that 'a did, and said they were devils incarnate.
_Quick._ (_crosses L.C._) 'A could never abide carnation;[23] 'twas a
colour he never liked.
_Boy._ Do you not remember, 'a saw a flea stick upon Bardolph's nose,
and 'a said it was a black soul burning in hell-fire?
_Bard._ Well, the fuel is gone that maintained that fire: that's all the
riches I got in his service.
_Nym._ Shall we shog off?[24] the king will be gone from Southampton.
  _Pist._ Come, let's away.--My love, give me thy lips.
  Look to my chattels and my moveables:
  Let senses rule;[25] the word is, _Pitch and pay_;[26]
  Trust none;
  For oaths are straws, men's faiths are wafer-cakes,
  And hold-fast is the only dog,[27] my duck:
  Therefore, _caveto_ be thy counsellor.[28]
  Go, clear thy crystals.[29]--Yoke-fellows in arms,
