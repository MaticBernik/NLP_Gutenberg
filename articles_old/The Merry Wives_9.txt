_Page._ 'The humour of it,' quoth 'a! here's a fellow              125
frights English out of his wits.
_Ford._ I will seek out Falstaff.
_Page._ I never heard such a drawling, affecting rogue.
_Ford._ If I do find it:--well.
_Page._ I will not believe such a Cataian, though the              130
priest o' the town commended him for a true man.
_Ford._ 'Twas a good sensible fellow:--well.
_Page._ How now, Meg!
    [_Mrs Page and Mrs Ford come forward._
_Mrs Page._ Whither go you, George? Hark you.
_Mrs Ford._ How now, sweet Frank! why art thou melancholy?         135
_Ford._ I melancholy! I am not melancholy. Get you
home, go.
_Mrs Ford._ Faith, thou hast some crotchets in thy
head. Now, will you go, Mistress Page?                             140
_Mrs Page._ Have with you. You'll come to dinner,
George? [_Aside to Mrs Ford_] Look who comes yonder:
she shall be our messenger to this paltry knight.
_Mrs Ford._ [_Aside to Mrs Page_] Trust me, I thought on
her: she'll fit it.                                                145
  _Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY._
_Mrs Page._ You are come to see my daughter Anne?
_Quick._ Ay, forsooth; and, I pray, how does good Mistress
Anne?
_Mrs Page._ Go in with us and see: we have an hour's
talk with you.                                                     150
    [_Exeunt Mrs Page, Mrs Ford, and Mrs Quickly._
_Page._ How now, Master Ford!
_Ford._ You heard what this knave told me, did you not?
_Page._ Yes: and you heard what the other told me?
_Ford._ Do you think there is truth in them?
_Page._ Hang 'em, slaves! I do not think the knight                155
would offer it: but these that accuse him in his intent
towards our wives are a yoke of his discarded men; very
rogues, now they be out of service.
_Ford._ Were they his men?
_Page._ Marry, were they.                                          160
_Ford._ I like it never the better for that. Does he lie
at the Garter?
_Page._ Ay, marry, does he. If he should intend this
voyage toward my wife, I would turn her loose to him; and
what he gets more of her than sharp words, let it lie on my        165
head.
_Ford._ I do not misdoubt my wife; but I would be loath
to turn them together. A man may be too confident: I
would have nothing lie on my head: I cannot be thus
satisfied.                                                         170
_Page._ Look where my ranting host of the Garter
comes: there is either liquor in his pate, or money in his
purse, when he looks so merrily.
  _Enter HOST._
How now, mine host!
_Host._ How now, bully-rook! thou'rt a gentleman.                  175
Cavaleiro-justice, I say!
  _Enter SHALLOW._
_Shal._ I follow, mine host, I follow. Good even and
twenty, good Master Page! Master Page, will you go with
us? we have sport in hand.
_Host._ Tell him, cavaleiro-justice; tell him, bully-rook.         180
_Shal._ Sir, there is a fray to be fought between Sir
Hugh the Welsh priest and Caius the French doctor.
_Ford._ Good mine host o' the Garter, a word with you.
    [_Drawing him aside._
