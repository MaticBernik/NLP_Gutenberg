_Ham._ I shall in all my best
Obey you Madam.[4]
_King._ Why 'tis a louing, and a faire Reply,
Be as our selfe in Denmarke. Madam come,
This gentle and vnforc'd accord of _Hamlet_[5]
Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
No iocond health that Denmarke drinkes to day,
[Sidenote: 44] But the great Cannon to the Clowds shall tell,
[Footnote 1: _Corpse_.]
[Footnote 2: --seeking to propitiate him with the hope that his
succession had been but postponed by his uncle's election.]
[Footnote 3: Note that Hamlet was educated in Germany--at Wittenberg,
the university where in 1508 Luther was appointed professor of
Philosophy. Compare 19. There was love of study as well as disgust with
home in his desire to return to _Schoole_: this from what we know of him
afterwards.]
[Footnote 4: Emphasis on _obey_. A light on the character of Hamlet.]
[Footnote 5: He takes it, or pretends to take it, for far more than it
was. He desires friendly relations with Hamlet.]
[Page 24]
And the Kings Rouce,[1] the Heauens shall bruite againe,
Respeaking earthly Thunder. Come away.
     _Exeunt_              [Sidenote: _Florish. Exeunt all but Hamlet._]
_Manet Hamlet._
[2]_Ham._ Oh that this too too solid Flesh, would melt,
                                            [Sidenote: sallied flesh[3]]
Thaw, and resolue it selfe into a Dew:
[Sidenote: 125,247,260] Or that the Euerlasting had not fixt
[Sidenote: 121 _bis_] His Cannon 'gainst Selfe-slaughter. O God, O God!
                                [Sidenote: seale slaughter, o God, God,]
How weary, stale, flat, and vnprofitable                [Sidenote: wary]
Seemes to me all the vses of this world?               [Sidenote: seeme]
Fie on't? Oh fie, fie, 'tis an vnweeded Garden       [Sidenote: ah fie,]
That growes to Seed: Things rank, and grosse in Nature
Possesse it meerely. That it should come to this:
                            [Sidenote: meerely that it should come thus]
But two months dead[4]: Nay, not so much; not two,
So excellent a King, that was to this
_Hiperion_ to a Satyre: so louing to my Mother,
That he might not beteene the windes of heauen    [Sidenote: beteeme[5]]
Visit her face too roughly. Heauen and Earth
Must I remember: why she would hang on him,           [Sidenote: should]
As if encrease of Appetite had growne
By what it fed on; and yet within a month?
Let me not thinke on't: Frailty, thy name is woman.[6]
A little Month, or ere those shooes were old,
With which she followed my poore Fathers body
Like _Niobe_, all teares. Why she, euen she.[7]
(O Heauen! A beast that wants discourse[8] of Reason   [Sidenote: O God]
Would haue mourn'd longer) married with mine Vnkle,       [Sidenote: my]
[Footnote 1: German _Rausch_, _drunkenness_. 44, 68]
[Footnote 2: A soliloquy is as the drawing called a section of a thing:
it shows the inside of the man. Soliloquy is only rare, not unnatural,
and in art serves to reveal more of nature. In the drama it is the
lifting of a veil through which dialogue passes. The scene is for the
moment shifted into the lonely spiritual world, and here we begin to
know Hamlet. Such is his wretchedness, both in mind and circumstance,
that he could well wish to vanish from the world. The suggestion of
suicide, however, he dismisses at once--with a momentary regret, it is
true--but he dismisses it--as against the will of God to whom he appeals
in his misery. The cause of his misery is now made plain to us--his
trouble that passes show, deprives life of its interest, and renders the
world a disgust to him. There is no lamentation over his father's death,
so dwelt upon by the king; for loving grief does not crush. Far less
could his uncle's sharp practice, in scheming for his own election
during Hamlet's absence, have wrought in a philosopher like him such an
effect. The one makes him sorrowful, the other might well annoy him, but
neither could render him unhappy: his misery lies at his mother's door;
it is her conduct that has put out the light of her son's life. She who
had been to him the type of all excellence, she whom his father had
idolized, has within a month of his death married his uncle, and is
living in habitual incest--for as such, a marriage of the kind was then
unanimously regarded. To Hamlet's condition and behaviour, his mother,
her past and her present, is the only and sufficing key. His very idea
of unity had been rent in twain.]
