MRS. BORKMAN.
  Yes, I believe they were.  But I know nothing about him.  He
was quite outside our circle--when we had a circle----
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  So he comes out to see Borkman now?
MRS. BORKMAN.
  Yes, he condescends to.  But of course he only comes when it
is dark.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  This Foldal--he was one of those that suffered when the bank
failed?
MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Carelessly.]  Yes, I believe I heard he had lost some money.
But no doubt it was something quite trifling.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [With slight emphasis.]  It was all he possessed.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Smiling.]  Oh, well; what he possessed must have been little
enough--nothing to speak of.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  And he did not speak of it--Foldal I mean--during the
investigation.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  At all events, I can assure you Erhart has made ample amends
for any little loss he may have suffered.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [With surprise.]  Erhart!  How can Erhart have done that?
MRS. BORKMAN.
  He has taken an interest in Foldal's youngest daughter.  He has
taught her things, and put her in the way of getting employment,
and some day providing for herself.  I am sure that is a great
deal more than her father could ever have done for her.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Yes, I daresay her father can't afford to do much.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  And then Erhart has arranged for her to have lessons in music.
She has made such progress already that she can come up to--to
him in the gallery, and play to him.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  So he is still fond of music?
MRS. BORKMAN.
  Oh yes, I suppose he is.  Of course he has the piano you sent
out here--when he was expected back----
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  And she plays to him on it?
MRS. BORKMAN.
  Yes, now and then--in the evenings.  That is Erhart's doing, too.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Has the poor girl to come all the long way out here, and then
back to town again?
MRS. BORKMAN.
  No, she doesn't need to.  Erhart has arranged for her to stay
with a lady who lives near us--a Mrs. Wilton----
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [With interest.]  Mrs. Wilton?
MRS. BORKMAN.
  A very rich woman.  You don't know her.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  I have heard her name.  Mrs. Fanny Wilton, is it not----?
MRS. BORKMAN.
  Yes, quite right.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Erhart has mentioned her several times.  Does she live out
here now?
MRS. BORKMAN.
  Yes, she has taken a villa here; she moved out from town some
time ago.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [With a slight hesitation.]  They say she is divorced from
her husband.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  Her husband has been dead for several years.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Yes, but they were divorced.  He got a divorce.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  He deserted her, that is what he did.  I am sure the fault
wasn't hers.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Do you know her at all intimately, Gunhild?
MRS. BORKMAN.
  Oh yes, pretty well.  She lives close by here; and she looks in
every now and then.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  And do you like her?
