_Mrs. Linde_. My mother was alive then, and was bedridden and helpless,
and I had to provide for my two younger brothers; so I did not think I
was justified in refusing his offer.
_Nora_. No, perhaps you were quite right. He was rich at that time,
then?
_Mrs. Linde_. I believe he was quite well off. But his business was a
precarious one; and, when he died, it all went to pieces and there was
nothing left.
_Nora_. And then?--
_Mrs. Linde_. Well, I had to turn my hand to anything I could
find--first a small shop, then a small school, and so on. The last three
years have seemed like one long working-day, with no rest. Now it is at
an end, Nora. My poor mother needs me no more, for she is gone; and the
boys do not need me either; they have got situations and can shift for
themselves.
_Nora_. What a relief you must feel it--
_Mrs. Linde_. No, indeed; I only feel my life unspeakably empty. No one
to live for any more. (_Gets up restlessly_.) That is why I could not
stand the life in my little backwater any longer. I hope it may be
easier here to find something which will busy me and occupy my thoughts.
If only I could have the good luck to get some regular work--office work
of some kind--
_Nora_. But, Christine, that is so frightfully tiring, and you look
tired out now. You had far better go away to some watering-place.
_Mrs. Linde_ (_walking to the window_). I have no father to give me
money for a journey, Nora.
_Nora_ (_rising_). Oh, don't be angry with me.
_Mrs. Linde_ (_going up to her_). It is you that must not be angry with
me, dear. The worst of a position like mine is that it makes one so
bitter. No one to work for, and yet obliged to be always on the look-out
for chances. One must live, and so one becomes selfish. When you told me
of the happy turn your fortunes have taken--you will hardly believe
it--I was delighted not so much on your account as on my own.
_Nora_. How do you mean?--Oh, I understand. You mean that perhaps
Torvald could get you something to do.
_Mrs. Linde_. Yes, that was what I was thinking of.
_Nora_. He must, Christine. Just leave it to me; I will broach the
subject very cleverly--I will think of something that will please him
very much. It will make me so happy to be of some use to you.
_Mrs. Linde_. How kind you are, Nora, to be so anxious to help me! It is
doubly kind in you, for you know so little of the burdens and troubles
of life.
_Nora_. I--? I know so little of them?
_Mrs Linde_ (_smiling_). My dear! Small household cares and that sort of
thing!--You are a child, Nora.
_Nora_ (_tosses her head and crosses the stage_). You ought not to be so
superior.
