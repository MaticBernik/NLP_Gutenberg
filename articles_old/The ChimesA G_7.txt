Toby knew not whether to be agonised or glad, to see that Meg had turned
a deadly white, and dropped her lovers hand.
And as for you, you dull dog, said the Alderman, turning with even
increased cheerfulness and urbanity to the young smith, what are you
thinking of being married for?  What do you want to be married for, you
silly fellow?  If I was a fine, young, strapping chap like you, I should
be ashamed of being milksop enough to pin myself to a womans
apron-strings!  Why, shell be an old woman before youre a middle-aged
man!  And a pretty figure youll cut then, with a draggle-tailed wife and
a crowd of squalling children crying after you wherever you go!
O, he knew how to banter the common people, Alderman Cute!
There!  Go along with you, said the Alderman, and repent.  Dont make
such a fool of yourself as to get married on New Years Day.  Youll
think very differently of it, long before next New Years Day: a trim
young fellow like you, with all the girls looking after you.  There!  Go
along with you!
They went along.  Not arm in arm, or hand in hand, or interchanging
bright glances; but, she in tears; he, gloomy and down-looking.  Were
these the hearts that had so lately made old Tobys leap up from its
faintness?  No, no.  The Alderman (a blessing on his head!) had Put
_them_ Down.
As you happen to be here, said the Alderman to Toby, you shall carry a
letter for me.  Can you be quick?  Youre an old man.
Toby, who had been looking after Meg, quite stupidly, made shift to
murmur out that he was very quick, and very strong.
How old are you? inquired the Alderman.
Im over sixty, sir, said Toby.
O!  This mans a great deal past the average age, you know, cried Mr.
Filer breaking in as if his patience would bear some trying, but this
really was carrying matters a little too far.
I feel Im intruding, sir, said Toby.  II misdoubted it this morning.
Oh dear me!
The Alderman cut him short by giving him the letter from his pocket.
Toby would have got a shilling too; but Mr. Filer clearly showing that in
that case he would rob a certain given number of persons of
ninepence-halfpenny a-piece, he only got sixpence; and thought himself
very well off to get that.
Then the Alderman gave an arm to each of his friends, and walked off in
high feather; but, he immediately came hurrying back alone, as if he had
forgotten something.
Porter! said the Alderman.
Sir! said Toby.
Take care of that daughter of yours.  Shes much too handsome.
Even her good looks are stolen from somebody or other, I suppose,
thought Toby, looking at the sixpence in his hand, and thinking of the
tripe.  Shes been and robbed five hundred ladies of a bloom a-piece, I
shouldnt wonder.  Its very dreadful!
Shes much too handsome, my man, repeated the Alderman.  The chances
are, that shell come to no good, I clearly see.  Observe what I say.
Take care of her!  With which, he hurried off again.
