FURIA.  Enough!  I trust you.  Ah, my heart is eased.
In your hand now indeed rests my revenge.
CATILINE.  It shall be carried out.  But tell me this,--
Who is your foe?  And what was his transgression?
FURIA.  Close by the Tiber, far from the city's tumult,
My cradle stood; it was a quiet home!
A sister much beloved lived with me there,
A chosen vestal from her childhood days.--
Then came a coward to our distant valley;--
He saw the fair, young priestess of the future--
CATILINE.  [Surprised.]  A priestess?  Tell me--!  Speak--!
FURIA.  He ravished her.
She sought a grave beneath the Tiber's stream.
CATILINE.  [Uneasy.]  You know him?
FURIA.  I have never seen the man.
When first I heard the tidings, all was past.
His name is all I know.
CATILINE.  Then speak it out!
FURIA.  Now is it famed.  His name is Catiline.
CATILINE.  [Taken aback.]
What do you say?  Oh, horrors!  Furia, speak--!
FURIA.  Calm yourself!  What perturbs you?  You grow pale.
My Lucius,--is this man perhaps your friend?
CATILINE.  My friend?  Ah, Furia, no;--no longer now.
For I have cursed,--and sworn eternal hate
Against myself.
FURIA.  You--you are Catiline?
CATILINE.  Yes, I am he.
FURIA.  My Sylvia you disgraced?
Nemesis then indeed has heard my prayer;--
Vengeance you have invoked on your own head!
Woe on you, man of violence!  Woe!
CATILINE.  How blank
The stare is in your eye.  Like Sylvia's shade
You seem to me in this dim candle light.
[He rushes out; the lamp with the sacred fire goes out.]
FURIA.  [After a pause.]  Yes, now I understand it.  From my eyes
The veil is fallen,--in the dark I see.
Hatred it was that settled in my breast,
When first I spied him in the market-place.
A strange emotion; like a crimson flame!
Ah, he shall know what such a hate as mine,
Constantly brewing, never satisfied,
Can fashion out in ruin and revenge!
A VESTAL.  [Enters.]  Go, Furia, go; your watch is at an end;
Therefore I came--.  Yet, sacred goddess, here--
Woe unto you!  The vestal fire is dead!
FURIA.  [Bewildered.]
Dead, did you say?  So bright it never burned;--
'Twill never, never die!
THE VESTAL.  Great heavens,--what is this?
FURIA.  The fires of hate are not thus lightly quenched!
Behold, love bursts forth of a sudden,--dies
Within the hour; but hate--
THE VESTAL.  By all the gods,--
This is sheer madness!
[Calls out.]
THE VESTAL.  Come!  Oh, help!  Come, help!
[VESTALS and temple SERVANTS rush in.]
SOME.  What is amiss?
OTHERS.  The vestal fire is dead!
FURIA.  But hate burns on; revenge still blazes high!
THE VESTALS.  Away with her to trial and punishment!
[They carry her out between them.]
CURIUS.  [Comes forward.]
To prison now they take her.  Thence to death.--
No, no, by all the gods, this shall not be!
Must she, most glorious of womankind,
Thus perish in disgrace, entombed alive?--
Oh, never have I felt so strangely moved.
Is this then love?  Yes, love it is indeed.--
Then shall I set her free!--But Catiline?
With hate and vengeance will she follow him.
Has he maligners not enough already?
Dare I still others to their number add?
He was to me as were an elder brother;
And gratitude now bids me that I shield him.--
But what of love?  Ah, what does it command?
And should he quake, the fearless Catiline,
Before the intrigues of a woman?  No;--
Then to the rescue work this very hour!
Wait, Furia;--I shall drag you from your grave
To life again,--though at the risk of death!
