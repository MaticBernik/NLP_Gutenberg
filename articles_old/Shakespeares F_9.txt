He drawes, and is charmed from mouing.
  Mira. O deere Father,
Make not too rash a triall of him, for
Hee's gentle, and not fearfull
   Pros. What I say,
My foote my Tutor? Put thy sword vp Traitor,
Who mak'st a shew, but dar'st not strike: thy conscience
Is so possest with guilt: Come, from thy ward,
For I can heere disarme thee with this sticke,
And make thy weapon drop
   Mira. Beseech you Father
   Pros. Hence: hang not on my garments
   Mira. Sir haue pity,
Ile be his surety
   Pros. Silence: One word more
Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee: What,
An aduocate for an Impostor? Hush:
Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he,
(Hauing seene but him and Caliban:) Foolish wench,
To th' most of men, this is a Caliban,
And they to him are Angels
   Mira. My affections
Are then most humble: I haue no ambition
To see a goodlier man
   Pros. Come on, obey:
Thy Nerues are in their infancy againe.
And haue no vigour in them
   Fer. So they are:
My spirits, as in a dreame, are all bound vp:
My Fathers losse, the weaknesse which I feele,
The wracke of all my friends, nor this mans threats,
To whom I am subdude, are but light to me,
Might I but through my prison once a day
Behold this Mayd: all corners else o'th' Earth
Let liberty make vse of: space enough
Haue I in such a prison
   Pros. It workes: Come on.
Thou hast done well, fine Ariell: follow me,
Harke what thou else shalt do mee
   Mira. Be of comfort,
My Fathers of a better nature (Sir)
Then he appeares by speech: this is vnwonted
Which now came from him
   Pros. Thou shalt be as free
As mountaine windes; but then exactly do
All points of my command
   Ariell. To th' syllable
   Pros. Come follow: speake not for him.
Exeunt.

  Gonz. Beseech you Sir, be merry; you haue cause,
(So haue we all) of ioy; for our escape
Is much beyond our losse; our hint of woe
Is common, euery day, some Saylors wife,
The Masters of some Merchant, and the Merchant
Haue iust our Theame of woe: But for the miracle,
(I meane our preseruation) few in millions
Can speake like vs: then wisely (good Sir) weigh
Our sorrow, with our comfort
   Alons. Prethee peace
   Seb. He receiues comfort like cold porredge
   Ant. The Visitor will not giue him ore so
   Seb. Looke, hee's winding vp the watch of his wit,
By and by it will strike
   Gon. Sir
   Seb. One: Tell
   Gon. When euery greefe is entertaind,
That's offer'd comes to th' entertainer
   Seb. A dollor
   Gon. Dolour comes to him indeed, you haue spoken
truer then you purpos'd
   Seb. You haue taken it wiselier then I meant you
should
   Gon. Therefore my Lord
   Ant. Fie, what a spend-thrift is he of his tongue
