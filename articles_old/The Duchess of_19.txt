GUIDO
   I cannot speak at all.
DUCHESS
   Let as not talk of this!  Let us go hence:
   Is not the barrier broken down between us?
   What would you more?  Come, it is almost morning.
                                             [_Puts her hand on_ GUIDOS.]
GUIDO [_breaking from her_]
   O damned saint!  O angel fresh from Hell!
   What bloody devil tempted thee to this!
   That thou hast killed thy husband, that is nothing
   Hell was already gaping for his soul
   But thou hast murdered Love, and in its place
   Hast set a horrible and bloodstained thing,
   Whose very breath breeds pestilence and plague,
   And strangles Love.
DUCHESS [_in amazed wonder_]
   I did it all for you.
   I would not have you do it, had you willed it,
   For I would keep you without blot or stain,
   A thing unblemished, unassailed, untarnished.
   Men do not know what women do for love.
   Have I not wrecked my soul for your dear sake,
   Here and hereafter?
GUIDO
   No, do not touch me,
   Between us lies a thin red stream of blood;
   I dare not look across it: when you stabbed him
   You stabbed Love with a sharp knife to the heart.
   We cannot meet again.
DUCHESS [_wringing her hands_]
   For you!  For you!
   I did it all for you: have you forgotten?
   You said there was a barrier between us;
   That barrier lies now i the upper chamber
   Upset, overthrown, beaten, and battered down,
   And will not part us ever.
GUIDO
   No, you mistook:
   Sin was the barrier, you have raised it up;
   Crime was the barrier, you have set it there.
   The barrier was murder, and your hand
   Has builded it so high it shuts out heaven,
   It shuts out God.
DUCHESS
   I did it all for you;
   You dare not leave me now: nay, Guido, listen.
   Get horses ready, we will fly to-night.
   The past is a bad dream, we will forget it:
   Before us lies the future: shall we not have
   Sweet days of love beneath our vines and laugh?
   No, no, we will not laugh, but, when we weep,
   Well, we will weep together; I will serve you;
   I will be very meek and very gentle:
   You do not know me.
GUIDO
   Nay, I know you now;
   Get hence, I say, out of my sight.
DUCHESS [_pacing up and down_]
   O God,
   How I have loved this man!
GUIDO
   You never loved me.
   Had it been so, Love would have stayed your hand.
   How could we sit together at Loves table?
   You have poured poison in the sacred wine,
   And Murder dips his fingers in the sop.
DUCHESS [_throws herself on her knees_]
   Then slay me now!  I have spilt blood to-night,
   You shall spill more, so we go hand in hand
   To heaven or to hell.  Draw your sword, Guido.
   Quick, let your soul go chambering in my heart,
   It will but find its masters image there.
   Nay, if you will not slay me with your sword,
   Bid me to fall upon this reeking knife,
   And I will do it.
