[Footnote 2: A word-play may be here intended between _sun_ and _son_:
_a little more than kin--too much i' th' Son_. So George Herbert:
    For when he sees my ways, I die;
    But I have got his _Son_, and he hath none;
and Dr. Donne:
                at my death thy Son
    Shall shine, as he shines now and heretofore.]

[Footnote 4: He is the only one who has not for the wedding put off his
mourning.]
[Footnote 5: _lowered_, or cast down: _Fr. avaler_, to lower.]
[Footnote 6: 'Plainly you treat it as a common matter--a thing of no
significance!' _I_ is constantly used for _ay_, _yes_.]
[Footnote 7: He pounces on the word _seems_.]
[Footnote 8: Not unfrequently the type would appear to have been set up
from dictation.]
[Footnote 9: They are things of the outside, and must _seem_, for they
are capable of being imitated; they are the natural _shows_ of grief.
But he has that in him which cannot _show_ or _seem_, because nothing
can represent it. These are 'the Trappings and the Suites of _woe_;'
they fitly represent woe, but they cannot shadow forth that which is
within him--a something different from woe, far beyond it and worse,
passing all reach of embodiment and manifestation. What this something
is, comes out the moment he is left by himself.]
[Footnote 10: The emphasis is on _might_.]
[Footnote 11: Both his uncle and his mother decline to understand him.
They will have it he mourns the death of his father, though they must at
least suspect another cause for his grief. Note the intellectual mastery
of the hypocrite--which accounts for his success.]
[Footnote 12: belonging to _obsequies_.]

Of impious stubbornnesse. Tis vnmanly greefe,
It shewes a will most incorrect to Heauen,
A Heart vnfortified, a Minde impatient,             [Sidenote: or minde]
An Vnderstanding simple, and vnschool'd:
For, what we know must be, and is as common
As any the most vulgar thing to sence,
Why should we in our peeuish Opposition
Take it to heart? Fye, 'tis a fault to Heauen,
A fault against the Dead, a fault to Nature,
To Reason most absurd, whose common Theame
Is death of Fathers, and who still hath cried,
From the first Coarse,[1] till he that dyed to day,   [Sidenote: course]
This must be so. We pray you throw to earth
This vnpreuayling woe, and thinke of vs
As of a Father; For let the world take note,
You are the most immediate to our Throne,[2]
And with no lesse Nobility of Loue,
Then that which deerest Father beares his Sonne,
Do I impart towards you. For your intent              [Sidenote: toward]
[Sidenote: 18] In going backe to Schoole in Wittenberg,[3]
It is most retrograde to our desire:               [Sidenote: retrogard]
And we beseech you, bend you to remaine
Heere in the cheere and comfort of our eye,
Our cheefest Courtier Cosin, and our Sonne.
_Qu._ Let not thy Mother lose her Prayers _Hamlet_:    [Sidenote: loose]
I prythee stay with vs, go not to Wittenberg.      [Sidenote: pray thee]
