PROFESSOR RUBEK.
As the model for my art--
IRENE. --in frank, utter nakedness--
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[With emotion.] And you did serve me, Irene--so bravely--so gladly and
ungrudgingly.
IRENE.
Yes, with all the pulsing blood of my youth, I served you!
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Nodding, with a look of gratitude.] That you have every right to say.
IRENE.
I fell down at your feet and served you, Arnold! [Holding her clenched
hand towards him.] But you, you,--you--!
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Defensively.] I never did you any wrong! Never, Irene!
IRENE.
Yes, you did! You did wrong to my innermost, inborn nature--
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Starting back.] I--!
IRENE.
Yes, you! I exposed myself wholly and unreservedly to your gaze--[More
softly.] And never once did you touch me.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Irene, did you not understand that many a time I was almost beside
myself under the spell of all your loveliness?
IRENE.
[Continuing undisturbed.] And yet--if you had touched me, I think I
should have killed you on the spot. For I had a sharp needle always upon
me--hidden in my hair-- [Strokes her forehead meditatively.] But after
all--after all--that you could--
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Looks impressively at her.] I was an artist, Irene.
IRENE.
[Darkly.] That is just it. That is just it.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
An artist first of all. And I was sick with the desire to achieve the
great work of my life. [Losing himself in recollection.] It was to be
called "The Resurrection Day"--figured in the likeness of a young woman,
awakening from the sleep of death--
IRENE.
Our child, yes--
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Continuing.] It was to be the awakening of the noblest, purest, most
ideal woman the world ever saw. Then I found you. You were what I
required in every respect. And you consented so willingly--so gladly.
You renounced home and kindred--and went with me.
IRENE.
To go with you meant for me the resurrection of my childhood.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
That was just why I found in you all that I required--in you and in no
one else. I came to look on you as a thing hallowed, not to be touched
save in adoring thoughts. In those days I was still young, Irene. And
the superstition took hold of me that if I touched you, if I desired you
with my senses, my soul would be profaned, so that I should be unable
to accomplish what I was striving for.--And I still think there was some
truth in that.
IRENE.
[Nods with a touch of scorn.] The work of art first--then the human
being.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
You must judge me as you will; but at that time I was utterly dominated
by my great task--and exultantly happy in it.
IRENE.
And you achieved your great task, Arnold.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Thanks and praise be to you, I achieved my great task. I wanted to
embody the pure woman as I saw her awakening on the Resurrection Day.
Not marvelling at anything new and unknown and undivined; but filled
with a sacred joy at finding herself unchanged--she, the woman of
earth--in the higher, freer, happier region--after the long, dreamless
sleep of death. [More softly.] Thus did I fashion her.--I fashioned her
in your image, Irene.
