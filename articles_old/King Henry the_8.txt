    [Footnote IIc.3: _Henry lord Scroop of Masham,_] Was third husband
    of Joan Duchess of York (she had four), mother-in-law of Richard,
    Earl of Cambridge.]
    [Footnote IIc.4: _----the +gilt+ of France,_] i.e., _golden
    money_.]
    [Footnote IIc.5: _----this grace of kings_] i.e., he who does the
    greatest honor to the title. By the same phraseology the usurper
    in _Hamlet_ is called the _vice of kings_, i.e., the opprobrium of
    them.]
    [Footnote IIc.6: _----while we +force a play+._] To _force a play_
    is to produce a play by compelling many circumstances into a
    narrow compass.]
    [Footnote IIc.7: _We'll not offend one stomach_] That is, you
    shall pass the sea without the qualms of sea-sickness.]
    [Footnote IIc.8: _But, till the king come forth, and not till
    then,_] The meaning is, "We will not shift our scene unto
    Southampton till the king makes his appearance on the stage, and
    the scene will be at Southampton _only_ for the short time while
    he does appear on the stage; for, soon after his appearance, it
    will change to France." --MALONE.]
ACT II.
SCENE I.--COUNCIL CHAMBER IN SOUTHAMPTON CASTLE.
    _EXETER, BEDFORD, and WESTMORELAND, discovered._
  _Bed._ 'Fore Heaven, his grace is bold, to trust these traitors.
  _Exe._ They shall be apprehended by and by.
  _West._ How smooth and even they do bear themselves!
  As if allegiance in their bosoms sat,
  Crowned with faith and constant loyalty.
  _Bed._ The king hath note of all that they intend,
  By interception which they dream not of.
  _Exe._ Nay, but the man that was his bedfellow,(A)
  Whom he hath cloy'd and grac'd with princely favours,--
  That he should, for a foreign purse, so sell
  His sovereign's life to death and treachery!
    _Distant Trumpets sound. Enter King HENRY, SCROOP, CAMBRIDGE,
    GREY, Lords and Attendants, U.E.L.H._
  _K. Hen._ Now sits the wind fair, and we will aboard.
  My lord of Cambridge,--and my kind lord of Masham,--
  And you, my gentle knight,--give me your thoughts:
  Think you not, that the powers we bear with us
  Will cut their passage through the force of France?
  _Scroop._ No doubt, my liege, if each man do his best.
  _K. Hen._ I doubt not that; since we are well persuaded
  We carry not a heart with us from hence
  That grows not in a fair consent with ours,[1]
  Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish
  Success and conquest to attend on us.
  _Cam._ (R.) Never was monarch better fear'd and lov'd
  Than is your majesty: there's not, I think, a subject
  That sits in heart-grief and uneasiness
  Under the sweet shade of your government.
  _Grey._ (R.) Even those that were your father's enemies
  Have steep'd their galls in honey, and do serve you
  With hearts create[2] of duty and of zeal.
  _K.Hen._ (C.) We therefore have great cause of thankfulness;
  And shall forget the office of our hand,
  Sooner than quittance of desert and merit
  According to the weight and worthiness.
  Uncle of Exeter, R.
  Enlarge the man committed yesterday,
  That rail'd against our person: we consider
  It was excess of wine that set him on;
  And, on his more advice,[3] we pardon him.
