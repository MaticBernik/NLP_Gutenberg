_Ant. S._ What is she?
_Dro. S._ A very reverent body; ay, such a one as a man
may not speak of, without he say Sir-reverence. I have              90
but lean luck in the match, and yet is she a wondrous fat
marriage.
_Ant. S._ How dost thou mean a fat marriage?
_Dro. S._ Marry, sir, she's the kitchen-wench, and all
grease; and I know not what use to put her to, but to make          95
a lamp of her, and run from her by her own light. I warrant,
her rags, and the tallow in them, will burn a Poland
winter: if she lives till doomsday, she'll burn a week
longer than the whole world.
_Ant. S._ What complexion is she of?                               100
_Dro. S._ Swart, like my shoe, but her face nothing like
so clean kept: for why she sweats; a man may go over
shoes in the grime of it.
_Ant. S._ That's a fault that water will mend.
_Dro. S._ No, sir, 'tis in grain; Noah's flood could not           105
do it.
_Ant. S._ What's her name?
_Dro. S._ Nell, sir; but her name and three quarters,
that's an ell and three quarters, will not measure her from
hip to hip.                                                        110
_Ant. S._ Then she bears some breadth?
_Dro. S._ No longer from head to foot than from hip to
hip: she is spherical, like a globe; I could find out countries
in her.
_Ant. S._ In what part of her body stands Ireland?                 115
_Dro. S._ Marry, sir, in her buttocks: I found it out by
the bogs.
_Ant. S._ Where Scotland?
_Dro. S._ I found it by the barrenness; hard in the palm
of the hand.                                                       120
_Ant. S._ Where France?
_Dro. S._ In her forehead; armed and reverted, making
war against her heir.
_Ant. S._ Where England?
_Dro. S._ I looked for the chalky cliffs, but I could find         125
no whiteness in them; but I guess it stood in her chin, by
the salt rheum that ran between France and it.
_Ant. S._ Where Spain?
_Dro. S._ Faith, I saw it not; but I felt it hot in her
breath.                                                            130
_Ant. S._ Where America, the Indies?
_Dro. S._ Oh, sir, upon her nose, all o'er embellished
with rubies, carbuncles, sapphires, declining their rich aspect
to the hot breath of Spain; who sent whole armadoes
of caracks to be ballast at her nose.                              135
_Ant. S._ Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?
_Dro. S._ Oh, sir, I did not look so low. To conclude,
this drudge, or diviner, laid claim to me; called me
Dromio; swore I was assured to her; told me what privy
marks I had about me, as, the mark of my shoulder, the             140
mole in my neck, the great wart on my left arm, that
I, amazed, ran from her as a witch:
And, I think, if my breast had not been made of faith, and
        my heart of steel,
She had transform'd me to a curtal dog, and made me turn
        i' the wheel.
