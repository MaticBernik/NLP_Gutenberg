<U+202D>     All day, till sun-set, yet, we sat and eat,
<U+202D>  And libral store took in of wine and meat.
<U+202D>  The sun then down, and place resignd to shade,
<U+202D>  We slept.  Morn came, my men I raisd, and made
<U+202D>  All go aboard, weigh anchor, and away.
<U+202D>  They boarded, sat, and beat the aged sea;
<U+202D>  And forth we made sail, sad for loss before,
<U+202D>  Any yet had comfort since we lost no more.

<U+202D>  THE TENTH BOOK OF HOMERS ODYSSEYS
<U+202D>  THE ARGUMENT
<U+202D>  Ulysses now relates to us
<U+202D>  The grace he had with Aolus,
<U+202D>  Great Guardian of the hollow Winds;
<U+202D>  Which in a leather bag he binds,
<U+202D>  And gives Ulysses; all but one,
<U+202D>  Which Zephyr was, who filld alone
<U+202D>  Ulysses sails.  The bag once seen,
<U+202D>  While he slept, by Ulysses men,
<U+202D>  They thinking it did gold enclose,
<U+202D>  To find it, all the winds did loose,
<U+202D>  Who back flew to their Guard again.
<U+202D>  Forth saild he; and did next attain
<U+202D>  To where the Lastrygonians dwell.
<U+202D>  Where he eleven ships lost, and fell
<U+202D>  On the Aaan coast, whose shore
<U+202D>  He sends Eurylochus t explore,
<U+202D>  Dividing with him half his men.
<U+202D>  Who go, and turn no more again,
<U+202D>  All, save Eurylochus, to swine
<U+202D>  By Circe turnd.  Their stays incline
<U+202D>  Ulysses to their search; who got
<U+202D>  Of Mercury an antidote,
<U+202D>  Which moly was, gainst Circes charms,
<U+202D>  And so avoids his soldiers harms.
<U+202D>  A year with Circe all remain,
<U+202D>  And then their native forms regain.
<U+202D>  On utter shores a time they dwell,
<U+202D>  While Ithacus descends to hell.
<U+202D>  ANOTHER ARGUMENT
<U+202D>  _<U+039A><U+1F71><U+03C0><U+03C0><U+03B1>._
<U+202D>     Great Aolus,
<U+202D>        And Circe, friends
<U+202D>     Finds Ithacus;
<U+202D>        And hell descends.
<U+202D>  To the Aolian island we attaind,
<U+202D>  That swum about still on the sea, where reignd
<U+202D>  The God-lovd Aolus Hippotades.
<U+202D>  A wall of steel it had; and in the seas
<U+202D>  A wave-beat-smooth rock movd about the wall.
<U+202D>  Twelve children in his house imperial
<U+202D>  Were born to him; of which six daughters were,
<U+202D>  And six were sons, that youths sweet flowr did bear.
<U+202D>  His daughters to his sons he gave as wives;
<U+202D>  Who spent in feastful comforts all their lives,
<U+202D>  Close seated by their sire and his grave spouse.
<U+202D>  Past number were the dishes that the house
<U+202D>  Made ever savour; and still full the hall
<U+202D>  As long as day shind; in the night-time, all
<U+202D>  Slept with their chaste wives, each his fair carvd bed
<U+202D>  Most richly furnishd; and this life they led.
<U+202D>     We reachd the city and fair roofs of these,
<U+202D>  Where, a whole months time, all things that might please
<U+202D>  The king vouchsafd us; of great Troy inquird,
<U+202D>  The Grecian fleet, and how the Greeks retird.
<U+202D>  To all which I gave answer as behovd.
<U+202D>     The fit time come when I dismission movd,
<U+202D>  He nothing would deny me, but addrest
<U+202D>  My pass with such a bounty, as might best
<U+202D>  Teach me contentment; for he did enfold
<U+202D>  Within an ox-hide, flayd at nine years old,
<U+202D>  All th airy blasts that were of stormy kinds.
<U+202D>  Saturnius made him Steward of his Winds,
<U+202D>  And gave him powr to raise and to assuage.
<U+202D>  And these he gave me, curbd thus of their rage,
<U+202D>  Which in a glittring silver band I bound,
<U+202D>  And hung-up in my ship, enclosd so round
<U+202D>  That no egression any breath could find;
<U+202D>  Only he left abroad the Western Wind,
<U+202D>  To speed our ships, and us with blasts secure.
<U+202D>  But our securities made all unsure;
<U+202D>  Nor could he consummate our course alone,
<U+202D>  When all the rest had got egressión;
<U+202D>  Which thus succeeded:  Nine whole days and nights
<U+202D>  We saild in safety; and the tenth, the lights
<U+202D>  Borne on our country-earth we might descry,
<U+202D>  So near we drew; and yet evn then fell I,
<U+202D>  Being overwatchd, into a fatal sleep,
<U+202D>  For I would suffer no man else to keep
<U+202D>  The foot that ruld my vessels course, to lead  [1]
<U+202D>  The faster home.  My friends then Envy fed
<U+202D>  About the bag I hung-up, and supposd
<U+202D>  That gold and silver I had there enclosd,
<U+202D>  As gift from Aolus, and said:  O heavn!
<U+202D>  What grace and grave price is by all men givn
<U+202D>  To our commander!  Whatsoever coast
<U+202D>  Or town he comes to, how much he engrost
<U+202D>  Of fair and precious prey, and brought from Troy!
<U+202D>  We the same voyage went, and yet enjoy
<U+202D>  In our return these empty hands for all.
<U+202D>  This bag, now, Aolus was so liberal
<U+202D>  To make a guest-gift to him; let us try
<U+202D>  Of what consists the fair-bound treasury,
<U+202D>  And how much gold and silver it contains.
<U+202D>  _Ill counsel present approbation gains._
<U+202D>  They opd the bag, and out the vapours brake,
<U+202D>  When instant tempest did our vessel take,
<U+202D>  That bore us back to sea, to mourn anew
<U+202D>  Our absent country.  Up amazd I flew,
<U+202D>  And desprate things discoursd; if I should cast
<U+202D>  Myself to ruin in the seas, or taste
<U+202D>  Amongst the living more moan, and sustain?
<U+202D>  Silent, I did so, and lay hid again
<U+202D>  Beneath the hatches, while an ill wind took
<U+202D>  My ships back to Aolia, my men strook
<U+202D>  With woe enough.  We pumpd and landed then,
<U+202D>  Took food, for all this; and of all my men
<U+202D>  I took a herald to me, and away
<U+202D>  Went to the court of Aolus, where they
<U+202D>  Were feasting still; he, wife, and children, set
<U+202D>  Together close.  We would not at their meat
<U+202D>  Thrust in; but humbly on the threshold sat.
<U+202D>  He then, amazd, my presence wonderd at,
<U+202D>  And calld to me:  Ulysses!  How thus back
<U+202D>  Art thou arrivd here?  What foul spirit brake
<U+202D>  Into thy bosom, to retire thee thus?
<U+202D>  We thought we had deduction curious
<U+202D>  Givn thee before, to reach thy shore and home;
<U+202D>  Did it not like thee?  I, evn overcome
<U+202D>  With worthy sorrow, answerd:  My ill men
<U+202D>  Have done me mischief, and to them hath been
<U+202D>  My sleep th unhappy motive; but do you,
<U+202D>  Dearest of friends, deign succour to my vow.
<U+202D>  Your powrs command it.  Thus endeavourd I
<U+202D>  With soft speech to repair my misery.
<U+202D>  The rest with ruth sat dumb.  But thus spake he:
<U+202D>  Avaunt, and quickly quit my land of thee,
<U+202D>  Thou worst of all that breathe.  It fits not me
<U+202D>  To convoy, and take-in, whom Heavns expose.
<U+202D>  Away, and with thee go the worst of woes,
<U+202D>  That seekst my friendship, and the Gods thy foes.
<U+202D>     Thus he dismissd me sighing.  Forth we saild,
<U+202D>  At heart afflicted.  And now wholly faild
<U+202D>  The minds my men sustaind, so spent they were
<U+202D>  With toiling at their oars, and worse did bear
<U+202D>  Their growing labours; and they causd their grought
<U+202D>  By self-willd follies;  nor now ever thought
<U+202D>  To see their country more.  Six nights and days
<U+202D>  We saild; the seventh we saw fair Lamos raise
<U+202D>  Her lofty towrs, the Lastrygonian state
<U+202D>  That bears her ports so far disterminate;
<U+202D>  Where shepherd shepherd calls out, he at home  [2]
<U+202D>  Is calld out by the other that doth come
<U+202D>  From charge abroad, and then goes he to sleep,
<U+202D>  The other issuing; he whose turn doth keep
<U+202D>  The night observance hath his double hire,
<U+202D>  Since day and night in equal length expire
<U+202D>  About that region, and the nights watch weighd
<U+202D>  At twice the days ward, since the charge thats laid
<U+202D>  Upon the nights-man (besides breach of sleep)
<U+202D>  Exceeds the days-mans; for one oxen keep,
<U+202D>  The other sheep.  But when the haven we found,
<U+202D>  (Exceeding famous, and environd round
<U+202D>  With one continuate rock, which so much bent
<U+202D>  That both ends almost met, so prominent
<U+202D>  They were, and made the havens mouth passing strait)
<U+202D>  Our whole fleet in we got; in whose receit
<U+202D>  Our ships lay anchord close.  Nor needed we
<U+202D>  Fear harm on any stays, Tranquillity  [3]
<U+202D>  So purely sat there, that waves great nor small
<U+202D>  Did ever rise to any height at all.
<U+202D>  And yet would I no entry make, but stayd
<U+202D>  Alone without the haven, and thence surveyd,
<U+202D>  From out a lofty watch-towr raised there,
<U+202D>  The country round about; nor anywhere
<U+202D>  The work of man or beast appeard to me,
<U+202D>  Only a smoke from earth break I might see.
<U+202D>  I then made choice of two, and added more,
<U+202D>  A herald for associate, to explore
<U+202D>  What sort of men livd there.  They went, and saw
<U+202D>  A beaten way, through which carts usd to draw
<U+202D>  Wood from the high hills to the town, and met
<U+202D>  A maid without the port, about to get
<U+202D>  Some near spring-water.  She the daughter was
<U+202D>  Of mighty Lastrygonian Antiphas,
<U+202D>  And to the clear spring calld Artacia went,
<U+202D>  To which the whole town for their water sent.
<U+202D>  To her they came, and askd who governd there,
<U+202D>  And what the people whom he orderd were?
<U+202D>  She answerd not, but led them through the port,
<U+202D>  As making haste to show her fathers court.
<U+202D>  Where enterd, they beheld, to their affright,
<U+202D>  A woman like a mountain-top in height,
<U+202D>  Who rushd abroad, and from the council-place
<U+202D>  Calld home her horrid husband Antiphas,  [4]
<U+202D>  Who, deadly-minded, straight he snatchd up one,
<U+202D>  And fell to supper.  Both the rest were gone;
<U+202D>  And to the fleet came.  Antiphas a cry
<U+202D>  Drave through the city; which heard, instantly
<U+202D>  This way and that innumerable sorts,
<U+202D>  Not men, but giants, issued through the ports,
<U+202D>  And mighty flints from rocks tore, which they threw
<U+202D>  Amongst our ships; through which an ill noise flew
<U+202D>  Of shiverd ships, and life-expiring men,
<U+202D>  That were, like fishes, by the monsters slain,
<U+202D>  And borne to sad feast.  While they slaughterd these,
<U+202D>  That were engagd in all th advantages
<U+202D>  The close-mouthd and most dead-calm haven could give,
<U+202D>  I, that without lay, made some means to live,
<U+202D>  My sword drew, cut my gables, and to oars
<U+202D>  Set all my men; and, from the plagues those shores
<U+202D>  Let fly amongst us, we made haste to fly,
<U+202D>  My men close working as men loth to die.
<U+202D>  My ship flew freely off; but theirs that lay
<U+202D>  On heaps in harbours could enforce no way
<U+202D>  Through these stern fates that had engagd them there.
<U+202D>  Forth our sad remnant saild, yet still retaind
<U+202D>  The joys of men, that our poor few remaind.
<U+202D>     Then to the isle Aaa we attaind,
<U+202D>  Where fair-haird, dreadful, eloquent Circe reignd,
<U+202D>  Aatas sister both by dame and sire,
<U+202D>  Both daughters to Heavns man-enlightning Fire,
<U+202D>  And Perse, whom Oceanus begat,
<U+202D>  The ship-fit port here soon we landed at,
<U+202D>  Some God directing us.  Two days, two nights,
<U+202D>  We lay here pining in the fatal spights
<U+202D>  Of toil and sorrow; but the next third day
<U+202D>  When fair Aurora had informd, quick way
<U+202D>  I made out of my ship, my sword and lance
<U+202D>  Took for my surer guide, and made advance
<U+202D>  Up to a prospect; I assay to see
<U+202D>  The works of men, or hear mortality
<U+202D>  Exspire a voice.  When I had climbd a height,
<U+202D>  Rough and right hardly accessible, I might
<U+202D>  Behold from Circes house, that in a grove
<U+202D>  Set thick with trees stood, a bright vapour move,
<U+202D>  I then grew curious in my thought to try  [5]
<U+202D>  Some fit inquiry, when so spritely fly
<U+202D>  I saw the yellow smoke; but my discourse  [6]
<U+202D>  A first retiring to my ship gave force,
<U+202D>  To give my men their dinner, and to send
<U+202D>  (Before th adventure of myself) some friend.
<U+202D>  Being near my ship, of one so desolate
<U+202D>  Some God had pity, and would recreate
<U+202D>  My woes a little, putting up to me
<U+202D>  A great and high-palmd hart, that (fatally,
<U+202D>  Just in my way itself to taste a flood)
<U+202D>  Was then descending; the sun heat had sure
<U+202D>  Importund him, besides the temperature
<U+202D>  His natural heat gave.  Howsoever, I
<U+202D>  Made up to him, and let my javlin fly,
<U+202D>  That struck him through the mid-part of his chine,
<U+202D>  And made him, braying, to the dust confine
<U+202D>  His flying forces.  Forth his spirit flew;
<U+202D>  When I stept in, and from the deaths wound drew
<U+202D>  My shrewdly-bitten lance; there let him lie
<U+202D>  Till I, of cut-up osiers, did imply
<U+202D>  A withe a fathom long, with which his feet
<U+202D>  I made together in a sure league meet,
<U+202D>  Stoopd under him, and to my neck I heavd
<U+202D>  The mighty burden, of which I receivd
<U+202D>  A good part on my lance, for else I could
<U+202D>  By no means with one hand alone uphold
<U+202D>  (Joind with one shoulder) such a deathful load.
<U+202D>  And so, to both my shoulders, both hands stood
<U+202D>  Needful assistants; for it was a deer
<U+202D>  Goodly-well-grown.  When (coming something near
<U+202D>  Where rode my ships) I cast it down, and reard
<U+202D>  My friends with kind words; whom by name I cheerd,
<U+202D>  In note particular, and said:  See, friends,
<U+202D>  We will not yet to Plutos house; our ends
<U+202D>  Shall not be hastend, though we be declind
<U+202D>  In cause of comfort, till the day designd
<U+202D>  By Fates fixd finger.  Come, as long as food
<U+202D>  Or wine lasts in our ship, lets spirit our blood,
<U+202D>  And quit our care and hunger both in one.
<U+202D>     This said, they frolickd, came, and lookd upon
<U+202D>  With admiration the huge-bodied beast;
<U+202D>  And when their first-servd eyes had done their feast,
<U+202D>  They washd, and made a to-be-strivd-for meal  [7]
<U+202D>  In point of honour.  On which all did dwell
<U+202D>  The whole day long.  And, to our venisons store,
<U+202D>  We added wine till we could wish no more.
<U+202D>     Sun set, and darkness up, we slept, till light
<U+202D>  Put darkness down; and then did I excite
<U+202D>  My friends to counsel, uttring this:  Now, friends,  [8]
<U+202D>  Afford unpassionate ear; though ill Fate lends
<U+202D>  So good cause to your passion, no man knows
<U+202D>  The reason whence and how the darkness grows;
<U+202D>  The reason how the morn is thus begun;
<U+202D>  The reason how the man-enlightning sun
<U+202D>  Dives under earth;  the reason how again
<U+202D>  He rears his golden head.  Those counsels, then,
<U+202D>  That pass our comprehension, we must leave
<U+202D>  To him that knows their causes;  and receive
<U+202D>  Direction from him in our acts, as far
<U+202D>  As he shall please to make them regular,
<U+202D>  And stoop them to our reason.  In our state
<U+202D>  What then behoves us?  Can we estimate,
<U+202D>  With all our counsels, where we are?  Or know
<U+202D>  (Without instruction, past our own skills) how,
<U+202D>  Put off from hence, to steer our course the more?
<U+202D>  I think we cannot.  We must then explore
<U+202D>  These parts for information; in which way
<U+202D>  We thus far are:  Last morn I might display
<U+202D>  (From off a high-raisd cliff) an island lie
<U+202D>  Girt with th unmeasurd sea, and is so nigh
<U+202D>  That in the midst I saw the smoke arise
<U+202D>  Through tufts of trees.  This rests then to advise,
<U+202D>  Who shall explore this? This struck dead their hearts,
<U+202D>  Remembring the most execrable parts
<U+202D>  That Lastrygonian Antiphas had playd,
<U+202D>  And that foul Cyclop that their fellows brayd
<U+202D>  Betwixt his jaws; which movd them so, they cried.
<U+202D>  But idle tears had never wants supplied.
<U+202D>  I in two parts divided all, and gave
<U+202D>  To either part his captain.  I must have
<U+202D>  The charge of one; and one of God-like look,
<U+202D>  Eurylochus, the other.  Lots we shook,
<U+202D>  Put in a casque together, which of us
<U+202D>  Should lead th attempt; and twas Eurylochus.
<U+202D>  He freely went, with two-and-twenty more;
<U+202D>  All which took leave with tears; and our eyes wore
<U+202D>  The same wet badge of weak humanity.
<U+202D>  These in a dale did Circes house descry,
<U+202D>  Of bright stone built, in a conspicuous way.
<U+202D>  Before her gates hill-wolves, and lions, lay;
<U+202D>  Which with her virtuous drugs so tame she made,
<U+202D>  That wolf nor lion would one man invade
<U+202D>  With any violence, but all arose,
<U+202D>  Their huge long tails waggd, and in fawns would close,
<U+202D>  As loving dogs, when masters bring them home
<U+202D>  Relics of feast, in all observance come,
<U+202D>  And soothe their entries with their fawns and bounds,
<U+202D>  All guests still bringing some scraps for their hounds;
<U+202D>  So, on these men, the wolves and lions rampd,
<U+202D>  Their horrid paws set up.  Their spirits were dampd
<U+202D>  To see such monstrous kindness, stayd at gate,
<U+202D>  And heard within the Goddess elevate
<U+202D>  A voice divine, as at her web she wrought,
<U+202D>  Subtle, and glorious, and past earthly thought,
<U+202D>  As all the housewifries of Deities are.
<U+202D>  To hear a voice so ravishingly rare,
<U+202D>  Polités (one exceeding dear to me,
<U+202D>  A prince of men, and of no mean degree
<U+202D>  In knowing virtue, in all acts whose mind  [9]
<U+202D>  Discreet cares all ways usd to turn, and wind)
<U+202D>  Was yet surprisd with it, and said:  O friends,
<U+202D>  Some one abides within here, that commends
<U+202D>  The place to us, and breathes a voice divine,
<U+202D>  As she some web wrought, or her spindles twine
<U+202D>  She cherishd with her song; the pavement rings
<U+202D>  With imitation of the tunes she sings.
<U+202D>  Some woman, or some Goddess, tis.  Assay
<U+202D>  To see with knocking.  Thus said he, and they
<U+202D>  Both knockd, and calld; and straight her shining gates
<U+202D>  She opend, issuing, bade them in to cates.
<U+202D>  Led, and unwise, they followd; all but one,
<U+202D>  Which was Eurylochus, who stood alone
<U+202D>  Without the gates, suspicious of a sleight.
<U+202D>  They enterd, she made sit; and her deceit
<U+202D>  She cloakd with thrones, and goodly chairs of state;
<U+202D>  Set herby honey, and the delicate
<U+202D>  Wine brought from Smynra, to them; meal and cheese;
<U+202D>  But harmful venoms she commixd with these,
<U+202D>  That made their country vanish from their thought.
<U+202D>  Which eat, she touchd them with a rod that wrought
<U+202D>  Their transformation far past human wonts;
<U+202D>  Swines snouts, swines bodies, took they, bristles, grunts,
<U+202D>  But still retaind the souls they had before,
<U+202D>  Which made them mourn their bodies change the more.
<U+202D>  She shut them straight in styes, and gave them meat,
<U+202D>  Oak-mast, and beech, and cornel-fruit, they eat,
<U+202D>  Grovlling like swine on earth, in foulest sort.
<U+202D>  Eurylochus straight hasted the report
<U+202D>  Of this his fellows most remorseful fate,
<U+202D>  Came to the ships, but so excruciate
<U+202D>  Was with his woe, he could not speak a word,
<U+202D>  His eyes stood full of tears, which showd how stord
<U+202D>  His mind with moan remaind.  We all admird,
<U+202D>  Askd what had chancd him, earnestly desird
<U+202D>  He would resolve us.  At the last, our eyes
<U+202D>  Enflamd in him his fellows memories,  [10]
<U+202D>  And out his grief burst thus:  You willd; we went
<U+202D>  Through those thick woods you saw; when a descent
<U+202D>  Showd us a fair house, in a lightsome ground,
<U+202D>  Where, at some work, we heard a heavnly sound
<U+202D>  Breathd from a Goddess, or a womans, breast.
<U+202D>  They knockd, she opd her bright gates; each her guest
<U+202D>  Her fair invitement made; nor would they stay,
<U+202D>  Fools that they were, when she once led the way.
<U+202D>  I enterd not, suspecting some deceit.
<U+202D>  When all together vanishd, nor the sight
<U+202D>  Of anyone (though long I lookd) mine eye
<U+202D>  Could any way discover.  Instantly,
<U+202D>  My sword and bow reachd, I bad show the place,
<U+202D>  When down he fell, did both my knees embrace,
<U+202D>  And prayd with tears thus:  O thou kept of God,
<U+202D>  Do not thyself lose, nor to that abode
<U+202D>  Lead others rashly; both thyself, and all
<U+202D>  Thou venturst thither, I know well, must fall
<U+202D>  In one sure ruin.  With these few then fly;
<U+202D>  We yet may shun the others destiny.
<U+202D>     I answerd him:  Eurylochus!  Stay thou,
<U+202D>  And keep the ship then, eat and drink; I now
<U+202D>  Will undertake th adventure; there is cause
<U+202D>  In great Necessitys unalterd laws.
<U+202D>  This said, I left both ship and seas, and on
<U+202D>  Along the sacred valleys all alone
<U+202D>  Went in discovry, till at last I came
<U+202D>  Where of the main-medcine-making Dame
<U+202D>  I saw the great house; where encounterd me
<U+202D>  The golden-rod-sustaining Mercury,
<U+202D>  Evn entring Circes doors.  He met me in
<U+202D>  A young mans likeness, of the first-flowrd chin,
<U+202D>  Whose form hath all the grace of one so young.
<U+202D>  He first calld to me, then my hand he wrung,
<U+202D>  And said:  Thou no-place-finding-for-repose,
<U+202D>  Whither, alone, by these hill-confines, goes
<U+202D>  Thy erring foot?  Th art entring Circes house,
<U+202D>  Where, by her medcines, black, and sorcerous,
<U+202D>  Thy soldiers all are shut in well-armd styes,
<U+202D>  And turnd to swine.  Art thou arrivd with prize
<U+202D>  Fit for their ransoms?  Thou comst out no more,
<U+202D>  If once thou entrest, like thy men before
<U+202D>  Made to remain here.  But Ill guard thee free,
<U+202D>  And save thee in her spite.  Receive of me
<U+202D>  This fair and good receipt; with which once armd,
<U+202D>  Enter her roofs, for th art to all proof charmd
<U+202D>  Against the ill day.  I will tell thee all
<U+202D>  Her baneful counsel:  With a festival
<U+202D>  Shell first receive thee, but will spice thy bread
<U+202D>  With flowry poisons; yet unalteréd
<U+202D>  Shall thy firm form be, for this remedy
<U+202D>  Stands most approvd gainst all her sorcery,
<U+202D>  Which thus particularly shun:  When she
<U+202D>  Shall with her long rod strike thee, instantly
<U+202D>  Draw from thy thigh thy sword, and fly on her
<U+202D>  As to her slaughter.  She, surprisd with fear
<U+202D>  And love, at first, will bid thee to her bed.
<U+202D>  Nor say the Goddess nay, that welcoméd
<U+202D>  Thou mayst with all respect be, and procure
<U+202D>  Thy fellows freedoms.  But before, make sure
<U+202D>  Her favours to thee; and the great oath take
<U+202D>  With which the blesséd Gods assurance make
<U+202D>  Of all they promise; that no prejudice
<U+202D>  (By stripping thee of form, and faculties)
<U+202D>  She may so much as once attempt on thee.
<U+202D>  This said, he gave his antidote to me,
<U+202D>  Which from the earth he pluckd, and told me all
<U+202D>  The virtue of it, with what Deities call
<U+202D>  The name it bears; and Moly  [11]  they impose
<U+202D>  For name to it.  The root is hard to loose
<U+202D>  From hold of earth by mortals; but Gods powr
<U+202D>  Can all things do.  Tis black, but bears a flowr
<U+202D>  As white as milk.  And thus flew Mercury
<U+202D>  Up to immense Olympus, gliding by
<U+202D>  The sylvan island.  I made back my way
<U+202D>  To Circes house, my mind of my assay
<U+202D>  Much thought revolving.  At her gates I stayd
<U+202D>  And calld; she heard, and her bright doors displayd,
<U+202D>  Invited, led; I followd in, but tracd
<U+202D>  With some distraction.  In a throne she placd
<U+202D>  My welcome person; of a curious frame
<U+202D>  Twas, and so bright I sat as in a flame;
<U+202D>  A foot-stool added.  In a golden bowl
<U+202D>  She then subornd a potion, in her soul
<U+202D>  Deformd things thinking; for amidst the wine
<U+202D>  She mixd her man-transforming medicine;
<U+202D>  Which when she saw I had devourd, she then
<U+202D>  No more observd me with her soothing vein,
<U+202D>  But struck me with her rod, and to her stye
<U+202D>  Bad, out, away, and with thy fellows lie.
<U+202D>  I drew my sword, and chargd her, as I meant
<U+202D>  To take her life.  When out she cried, and bent
<U+202D>  Beneath my sword her knees, embracing mine,
<U+202D>  And, full of tears, said:  Who?  Of what high line
<U+202D>  Art thou the issue?  Whence?  What shores sustain
<U+202D>  Thy native city?  I amazd remain
<U+202D>  That, drinking these my venoms, th art not turnd.
<U+202D>  Never drunk any this cup but be mournd
<U+202D>  In other likeness, if it once had passd
<U+202D>  The ivory bounders of his tongue and taste.
<U+202D>  All but thyself are brutishly declind.
<U+202D>  Thy breast holds firm yet, and unchangd thy mind.
<U+202D>  Thou canst be therefore none else but the man
<U+202D>  Of many virtues, Ithacensian,
<U+202D>  Deep-sould, Ulysses, who; I oft was told,
<U+202D>  By that sly God that bears the rod of gold,
<U+202D>  Was to arrive here in retreat from Troy.
<U+202D>  Sheathe then thy sword, and let my bed enjoy
<U+202D>  So much a man, that when the bed we prove,
<U+202D>  We may believe in one anothers love.
<U+202D>     I then:  O Circe, why entreatst thou me
<U+202D>  To mix in any human league with thee,
<U+202D>  When thou my friends hast beasts turnd; and thy bed
<U+202D>  Tenderst to me, that I might likewise lead
<U+202D>  A beasts life with thee, softend, naked strippd,
<U+202D>  That in my blood thy banes may more be steepd?
<U+202D>  I never will ascend thy bed, before,
<U+202D>  I may affirm, that in heavns sight you swore
<U+202D>  The great oath of the Gods, that all attempt
<U+202D>  To do me ill is from your thoughts exempt.
<U+202D>     I said, she swore, when, all the oath-rites said,
<U+202D>  I then ascended her adornéd bed,
<U+202D>  But thus prepard:  Four handmaids served her there,
<U+202D>  That daughters to her silver fountains were,
<U+202D>  To her bright-sea-observing sacred floods,
<U+202D>  And to her uncut consecrated woods.
<U+202D>  One deckd the throne-tops with rich cloths of state,
<U+202D>  And did with silks the foot-pace consecrate.
<U+202D>  Another silver tables set before
<U+202D>  The pompous throne, and golden dishes store
<U+202D>  Servd in with sevral feast.  A third filld wine.
<U+202D>  The fourth brought water, and made fuel shine
<U+202D>  In ruddy fires beneath a womb of brass.
<U+202D>  Which heat, I bathd;  and odrous water was
<U+202D>  Disperpled lightly on my head and neck,
<U+202D>  That might my late heart-hurting sorrows check
<U+202D>  With the refreshing sweetness; and, for that,
<U+202D>  Men sometimes may be something delicate.
<U+202D>  Bathd, and adornd, she led me to a throne
<U+202D>  Of massy silver, and of fashión
<U+202D>  Exceeding curious.  A fair foot-stool set,
<U+202D>  Water apposd, and evry sort of meat
<U+202D>  Set on th elaborately-polishd board,
<U+202D>  She wishd my taste employd; but not a word
<U+202D>  Would my ears taste of taste; my mind had food
<U+202D>  That must digest; eye-meat would do me good.
<U+202D>  Circe (observing that I put no hand
<U+202D>  To any banquet, having countermand
<U+202D>  From weightier cares the light cates could excuse)
<U+202D>  Bowing her near me, these wingd words did use;
<U+202D>     Why sits Ulysses like one dumb, his mind
<U+202D>  Lessning with languors?  Nor to food inclind,
<U+202D>  Nor wine?  Whence comes it?  Out of any fear
<U+202D>  Of more illusion?  You must needs forbear
<U+202D>  That wrongful doubt, since you have heard me swear.
<U+202D>     O Circe!  I replied,  what man is he,
<U+202D>  Awd with the rights of true humanity,
<U+202D>  That dares taste food or wine, before he sees
<U+202D>  His friends redeemd from their deformities?
<U+202D>  If you be gentle, and indeed incline
<U+202D>  To let me taste the comfort of your wine,
<U+202D>  Dissolve the charms that their forcd forms enchain,
<U+202D>  And show me here my honourd friends like men.
<U+202D>     This said, she left her throne, and took her rod,
<U+202D>  Went to her stye, and let my men abroad,
<U+202D>  Like swine of nine years old.  They opposite stood,
<U+202D>  Observd their brutish form, and lookd for food;
<U+202D>  When, with another medcine, evry one
<U+202D>  All over smeard, their bristles all were gone,
<U+202D>  Producd by malice of the other bane,
<U+202D>  And evry one, afresh, lookd up a man,
<U+202D>  Both younger than they were, of stature more,
<U+202D>  And all their forms much goodlier than before.
<U+202D>  All knew me, clingd about me, and a cry
<U+202D>  Of pleasing mourning flew about so high
<U+202D>  The horrid roof resounded; and the queen
<U+202D>  Herself was movd to see our kind so keen,
<U+202D>  Who bad me now bring ship and men ashore,
<U+202D>  Our arms, and goods in caves hid, and restore
<U+202D>  Myself to her, with all my other men.
<U+202D>  I granted, went, and opd the weeping vein
<U+202D>  In all my men; whose violent joy to see
<U+202D>  My safe return was passing kindly free
<U+202D>  Of friendly tears, and miserably wept.
<U+202D>  You have not seen young heifers (highly kept,
<U+202D>  Filld full of daisies at the field, and drivn
<U+202D>  Home to their hovels, all so spritely givn
<U+202D>  That no room can contain them, but about
<U+202D>  Bace by the dams, and let their spirits out
<U+202D>  In ceaseless bleating) of more jocund plight
<U+202D>  Than my kind friends, evn crying out with sight
<U+202D>  Of my return so doubted; circled me
<U+202D>  With all their welcomes, and as cheerfully
<U+202D>  Disposd their rapt minds, as if there they saw
<U+202D>  Their natural country, cliffy Ithaca,
<U+202D>  And evn the roofs where they were bred and born,
<U+202D>  And vowd as much, with tears;  O your return
<U+202D>  As much delights us as in you had come
<U+202D>  Our country to us, and our natural home.
<U+202D>  But what unhappy fate hath reft our friends?
<U+202D>  I gave unlookd-for answer, that amends
<U+202D>  Made for their mourning, bad them first of all
<U+202D>  Our ship ashore draw, then in caverns stall
<U+202D>  Our foody cattle, hide our mutual prize,
<U+202D>  <U+1FFE>And then,<U+1FBF>  said I,  <U+1FFE>attend me, that your eyes,
<U+202D>  In Circes sacred house, may see each friend
<U+202D>  Eating and drinking banquets out of end.<U+1FBF>
<U+202D>     They soon obeyd; all but Eurylochus,
<U+202D>  Who needs would stay them all, and counselld thus:
<U+202D>     <U+1FFE>O wretches!  whither will ye?  Why are you
<U+202D>  Fond of your mischiefs, and such gladness show
<U+202D>  For Circes house, that will transform ye all
<U+202D>  To swine, or wolves, or lions?  Never shall
<U+202D>  Our heads get out, if once within we be,
<U+202D>  But stay compelld by strong necessity.
<U+202D>  So wrought the Cyclop, when t his cave our friends
<U+202D>  This bold one led on, and brought all their ends
<U+202D>  By his one indiscretion.<U+1FBF>  I for this
<U+202D>  Thought with my sword (that desprate head of his
<U+202D>  Hewn from his neck) to gash upon the ground
<U+202D>  His mangled body, though my blood was bound
<U+202D>  In near alliance to him.  But the rest
<U+202D>  With humble suit containd me, and request,
<U+202D>  That I would leave him with my ship alone,
<U+202D>  And to the sacred palace lead them on.
<U+202D>     I led them; nor Eurylochus would stay
<U+202D>  From their attendance on me, our late fray
<U+202D>  Struck to his heart so.  But mean time, my men,
<U+202D>  In Circes house, were all, in sevral bain,
<U+202D>  Studiously sweetend, smugd with oil, and deckd
<U+202D>  With in and out weeds, and a feast secret
<U+202D>  Servd in before them; at which close we found
<U+202D>  They all were set, cheerd, and carousing round,
<U+202D>  When mutual sight had, and all thought on, then
<U+202D>  Feast was forgotten, and the moan again  [12]
<U+202D>  About the house flew, drivn with wings of joy.
<U+202D>  But then spake Circe:  Now, no more annoy,
<U+202D>  I know myself what woes by sea, and shore,
<U+202D>  And men unjust have plagued enough before
<U+202D>  Your injurd virtues.  Here then feast as long,
<U+202D>  And be as cheerful, till ye grow as strong
<U+202D>  As when ye first forsook your country-earth.
<U+202D>  Ye now fare all like exiles; not a mirth,
<U+202D>  Flashd in amongst ye, but is quenchd again
<U+202D>  With still-renewd tears, though the beaten vein
<U+202D>  Of your distresses should, me think, be now
<U+202D>  Benumb with suffrance.  We did well allow
<U+202D>  Her kind persuasions, and the whole year stayd
<U+202D>  In varied feast with her.  When, now arrayd
<U+202D>  The world was with the spring, and orby hours
<U+202D>  Had gone the round again through herbs and flowrs,
<U+202D>  The months absolvd in order, till the days
<U+202D>  Had run their full race in Apollos rays;
<U+202D>  My friends rememberd me of home, and said;
<U+202D>  If ever fate would sign my pass, delayd
<U+202D>  It should be now no more.  I heard them well,
<U+202D>  Yet that day spent in feast, till darkness fell,
<U+202D>  And sleep his virtues through our vapours shed.
<U+202D>  When I ascended sacred Circes bed,
<U+202D>  Implord my pass, and her performéd vow
<U+202D>  Which now my soul urgd, and my soldiers now
<U+202D>  Afflicted me with tears to get them gone.
<U+202D>  All these I told her, and she answerd these:
<U+202D>  Much-skilld Ulysses Laertiades!
<U+202D>  Remain no more against your wills with me,
<U+202D>  But take your free way; only this must be
<U+202D>  Performd before you steer your course for home:
<U+202D>  You must the way to Pluto overcome,
<U+202D>  And stern Persephoné, to form your pass,
<U+202D>  By th aged Theban soul Tiresias,
<U+202D>  The dark-browd prophet, whose soul yet can see
<U+202D>  Clearly, and firmly; grave Persephoné,
<U+202D>  Evn dead, gave him a mind, that he alone
<U+202D>  Might sing truths solid wisdom, and not one
<U+202D>  Prove more than shade in his comparison.<U+1FBF>
<U+202D>     This broke my heart; I sunk into my bed,
<U+202D>  Mournd, and would never more be comforted
<U+202D>  With light, nor life.  But having now exprest
<U+202D>  My pains enough to her in my unrest,
<U+202D>  That so I might prepare her ruth, and get
<U+202D>  All I held fit for an affair so great,
<U+202D>  I said:  O Circe, who shall steer my course
<U+202D>  To Plutos kingdom?  Never ship had force
<U+202D>  To make that voyage.  The divine-in-voice
<U+202D>  Said;  Seek no guide, raise you your mast, and hoise
<U+202D>  Your ships white sails, and then sit yon at peace,
<U+202D>  The fresh North Spirit shall waft ye through the Seas.
<U+202D>  But, having past the ocean, you shall see
<U+202D>  A little shore, that to Persephoné
<U+202D>  Puts up a consecrated wood, where grows
<U+202D>  Tall firs, and sallows that their fruits soon lose.
<U+202D>  Cast anchor in the gulfs, and go alone
<U+202D>  To Plutos dark house, where, to Acheron
<U+202D>  Cocytus runs, and Pyriphlegethon,
<U+202D>  Cocytus born of Styx, and where a rock
<U+202D>  Of both the met floods bears the roaring shock.
<U+202D>  The dark heroë, great Tiresias,
<U+202D>  Now coming near, to gain propitious pass,
<U+202D>  Dig of a cubit evry way a pit,
<U+202D>  And pour to all that are deceasd in it
<U+202D>  A solemn sacrifice.  For which, first take
<U+202D>  Honey and wine, and their commixtion make;
<U+202D>  Then sweet wine neat; and thirdly water pour;
<U+202D>  And lastly add to these the whitest flour.
<U+202D>  Then vow to all the weak necks of the dead
<U+202D>  Offrings a number; and, when thou shalt tread
<U+202D>  The Ithacensian shore, to sacrifice
<U+202D>  A heifer never-tamd, and most of prize,
<U+202D>  A pile of all thy most esteeméd goods
<U+202D>  Enflaming to the dear streams of their bloods;
<U+202D>  And, in secret rites, to Tiresias vow
<U+202D>  A ram coal-black at all parts, that doth flow
<U+202D>  With fat and fleece, and all thy flocks doth lead.
<U+202D>  When the all-calling nation of the dead  [13]
<U+202D>  Thou thus hast prayd to, offer on the place
<U+202D>  A ram and ewe all black being turnd in face
<U+202D>  To dreadful Erebus, thyself aside
<U+202D>  The floods shore walking.  And then, gratified
<U+202D>  With flocks of souls of men and dames deceasd
<U+202D>  Shall all thy pious rites be.  Straight addressd
<U+202D>  See then the offring that thy fellows slew,
<U+202D>  Flayd, and imposd in fire; and all thy crew
<U+202D>  Pray to the state of either Deity,
<U+202D>  Grave Pluto, and severe Persephoné.
<U+202D>  Then draw thy sword, stand firm, nor suffer one
<U+202D>  Of all the faint shades of the dead and gone
<U+202D>  T approach the blood, till thou hast heard their king,
<U+202D>  The wise Tiresias; who thy offering
<U+202D>  Will instantly do honour, thy home-ways,
<U+202D>  And all the measure of them by the seas,
<U+202D>  Amply unfolding.  This the Goddess told;
<U+202D>  And then the Morning in her throne of gold
<U+202D>  Surveyd the vast world; by whose orient light
<U+202D>  The Nymph adornd me with attires as bright,
<U+202D>  Her own hands putting on both shirt and weed,
<U+202D>  Robes fine, and curious, and upon my head
<U+202D>  An ornament that glitterd like a flame,
<U+202D>  Girt me in gold; and forth betimes I came
<U+202D>  Amongst my soldiers, rousd them all from sleep,
<U+202D>  And bad them now no more observance keep
<U+202D>  Of ease, and feast, but straight a-shipboard fall,
<U+202D>  For now the Goddess had informd me all.
<U+202D>  Their noble spirits agreed; nor yet so clear
<U+202D>  Could I bring all off, but Elpenor there
<U+202D>  His heedless life left.  He was youngest man
<U+202D>  Of all my company, and one that wan
<U+202D>  Least fame for arms, as little for his brain;
<U+202D>  Who (too much steepd in wine, and so made fain
<U+202D>  To get refreshing by the cool of sleep,
<U+202D>  Apart his fellows, plungd in vapours deep,
<U+202D>  And they as high in tumult of their way)
<U+202D>  Suddenly wakd and (quite out of the stay
<U+202D>  A sober mind had givn him) would descend
<U+202D>  A huge long ladder, forward, and an end
<U+202D>  Fell from the very roof, full pitching on
<U+202D>  The dearest joint his head was placd upon,
<U+202D>  Which, quite dissolvd, let loose his soul to hell.
<U+202D>  I to the rest, and Circes means did tell
<U+202D>  Of our return, as crossing clean the hope
<U+202D>  I gave them first, and said:  You think the scope
<U+202D>  Of our endeavours now is straight for home;
<U+202D>  No;  Circe otherwise designd, whose doom
<U+202D>  Enjoind us first to greet the dreadful house
<U+202D>  Of austere Pluto and his glorious spouse,
<U+202D>  To take the counsel of Tiresias,
<U+202D>  The revrend Theban, to direct our pass.
<U+202D>     This brake their hearts, and grief made tear their hair.
<U+202D>  But grief was never good at great affair;
<U+202D>  It would have way yet.  We went woful on
<U+202D>  To ship and shore, where was arrivd as soon
<U+202D>  Circe unseen, a black ewe and a ram
<U+202D>  Binding for sacrifice, and, as she came,
<U+202D>  Vanishd again unwitnessd by our eyes;
<U+202D>  Which grievd not us, nor checkd our sacrifice,
<U+202D>  For who would see God, loth to let us see,
<U+202D>  This way or that bent; still his ways are free.
