_Escal._ I think no less. Good morrow to your lordship.
    [_Exit Angelo._
Now, sir, come on: what was done to Elbow's wife, once
more?
_Pom._ Once, sir? there was nothing done to her once.              135
_Elb._ I beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did
to my wife.
_Pom._ I beseech your honour, ask me.
_Escal._ Well, sir; what did this gentleman to her?
_Pom._ I beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman's face.          140
Good Master Froth, look upon his honour; 'tis for a good
purpose. Doth your honour mark his face?
_Escal._ Ay, sir, very well.
_Pom._ Nay, I beseech you, mark it well.
_Escal._ Well, I do so.                                            145
_Pom._ Doth your honour see any harm in his face?
_Escal._ Why, no.
_Pom._ I'll be supposed upon a book, his face is the
worst thing about him. Good, then; if his face be the worst
thing about him, how could Master Froth do the constable's         150
wife any harm? I would know that of your honour.
_Escal._ He's in the right. Constable, what say you to it?
_Elb._ First, an it like you, the house is a respected
house; next, this is a respected fellow; and his mistress is
a respected woman.                                                 155
_Pom._ By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected
person than any of us all.
_Elb._ Varlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicked varlet! the
time is yet to come that she was ever respected with
man, woman, or child.                                              160
_Pom._ Sir, she was respected with him before he married
with her.
_Escal._ Which is the wiser here? Justice or Iniquity?
Is this true?
_Elb._ O thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O thou wicked                165
Hannibal! I respected with her before I was married to
her! If ever I was respected with her, or she with me, let
not your worship think me the poor duke's officer. Prove
this, thou wicked Hannibal, or I'll have mine action of battery
on thee.                                                           170
_Escal._ If he took you a box o' th' ear, you might have
your action of slander too.
_Elb._ Marry, I thank your good worship for it. What
is't your worship's pleasure I shall do with this wicked
caitiff?                                                           175
_Escal._ Truly, officer, because he hath some offences in
him that thou wouldst discover if thou couldst, let him continue
in his courses till thou knowest what they are.
_Elb._ Marry, I thank your worship for it. Thou seest,
thou wicked varlet, now, what's come upon thee: thou art           180
to continue now, thou varlet; thou art to continue.
_Escal._ Where were you born, friend?
_Froth._ Here in Vienna, sir.
_Escal._ Are you of fourscore pounds a year?
_Froth._ Yes, an't please you, sir.                                185
_Escal._ So. What trade are you of, sir?
_Pom._ A tapster; a poor widow's tapster.
_Escal._ Your mistress' name?
_Pom._ Mistress Overdone.
_Escal._ Hath she had any more than one husband?                   190
_Pom._ Nine, sir; Overdone by the last.
_Escal._ Nine! Come hither to me, Master Froth.
Master Froth, I would not have you acquainted with tapsters:
they will draw you, Master Froth, and you will hang
them. Get you gone, and let me hear no more of you.                195
