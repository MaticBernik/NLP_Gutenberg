You asked relief of them?
Never; oh, God knows, never! My family have never asked a penny of a
parish. They would die first, and so would I, sir; but they said I might
do it, and I had better go to my husbands parish at once--and they
offered me money to go.
And you took it, of course?
No, sir; I had a little money, which I had earned by washing and
laundering, and I sold most of my things, as I could not carry them, and
came off. I felt hurt, sir; my heart rose against the treatment of the
parish, and I thought I should be better among my husbands
friends--and my child would, if anything happened to me; I had no
friends of my own.
Mr. Spires looked at the woman in silence. Did your husband tell you
anything of his friends? What sort of a man was he?
Oh, he was a gay young fellow, rather, sir; but not bad to me. He
always said his friends were well off in Stockington.
He did! said the manufacturer, with a great stare, and as if bolting
the words from his heart in a large gust of wonder.
The poor woman again looked at him with a strange look. The manufacturer
whistled to himself, and giving his horse a smart cut with the whip,
drove on faster than ever. The night was fast settling down; it was
numbing cold; a gray fog rose from the river as they thundered over the
old bridge; and tall engine chimneys, and black smoky houses loomed
through the dusk before them. They were at Stockington.
As they slackened their pace up a hill at the entrance of the town, Mr.
Spires again opened his mouth.
I should be sorry to hurt your feelings, Mrs. Deg, he said, but I
have my fears that you are coming to this place with false expectations.
I fear your husband did not give you the truest possible account of his
family here.
Oh, Sir! What--what is it? exclaimed the poor woman; in Gods name,
tell me!
Why, nothing more than this, said the manufacturer, that there are
very few of the Degs left here. They are old, and on the parish, and can
do nothing for you.
The poor woman gave a deep sigh, and was silent.
But dont be cast down, said Mr. Spires. He would not tell her what a
pauper family it really was, for he saw that she was a very feeling
woman, and he thought she would learn that soon enough. He felt that her
husband had from vanity given her a false account of his connections;
and he was really sorry for her.
Dont be cast down, he went on, you can wash and iron, you say; you
are young and strong; those are your friends. Depend on them, and
theyll be better friends to you than any other.
The poor woman was silent, leaning her head down on her slumbering
child, and crying to herself; and thus they drove on, through many long
and narrow streets, with gas flaring from the shops, but with few people
in the streets, and these hurrying shivering along the payment, so
intense was the cold. Anon they stopped at a large pair of gates; the
manufacturer rung a bell, which he could reach from his gig, and the
gates presently were flung open, and they drove into a spacious yard,
with a large handsome house, having a bright lamp burning before it, on
one side of the yard, and tall warehouses on the other.
