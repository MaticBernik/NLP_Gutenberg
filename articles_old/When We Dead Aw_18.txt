MAIA.
[Involuntarily folding her hands.] Why in all the world should we not
part then?
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Looks at her in astonishment.] Should you be willing to?
MAIA.
[Shrugging her shoulders.] Oh yes--if there's nothing else for it,
then--
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Eagerly.] But there is something else for it. There is an alternative--
MAIA.
[Holding up her forefinger.] Now you are thinking of the pale lady
again!
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Yes, to tell the truth, I cannot help constantly thinking of her. Ever
since I met her again. [A step nearer her.] For now I will tell you a
secret, Maia.
MAIA.
Well?
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Touching his own breast.] In here, you see--in here I have a little
bramah-locked casket. And in that casket all my sculptor's visions are
stored up. But when she disappeared and left no trace, the lock of
the casket snapped to. And she had the key--and she took it away with
her.--You, little Maia, you had no key; so all that the casket contains
must lie unused. And the years pass! And I have no means of getting at
the treasure.
MAIA.
[Trying to repress a subtle smile.] Then get her to open the casket for
you again--
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Not understanding.] Maia--?
MAIA. --for here she is, you see. And no doubt it's on account of this
casket that she has come.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
I have not said a single word to her on this subject!
MAIA.
[Looks innocently at him.] My dear Rubek--is it worth while to make all
this fuss and commotion about so simple a matter?
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Do you think this matter is so absolutely simple?
MAIA.
Yes, certainly I think so. Do you attach yourself to whoever you most
require. [Nods to him.] I shall always manage to find a place for
myself.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Where do you mean?
MAIA.
[Unconcerned, evasively.] Well--I need only take myself off to the
villa, if it should be necessary. But it won't be; for in town--in all
that great house of ours--there must surely, with a little good will, be
room enough for three.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Uncertainly.] And do you think that would work in the long run?
MAIA.
[In a light tone.] Very well, then--if it won't work, it won't. It is no
good talking about it.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
And what shall we do then, Maia--if it does not work?
MAIA.
[Untroubled.] Then we two will simply get out of each other's way--part
entirely. I shall always find something new for myself, somewhere in the
world. Something free! Free! Free!--No need to be anxious about that,
Professor Rubek! [Suddenly points off to the right.] Look there! There
we have her.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Turning.] Where?
MAIA.
Out on the plain. Striding--like a marble stature. She is coming this
way.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Stands gazing with his hand over his eyes.] Does not she look like the
Resurrection incarnate? [To himself.] And her I could displace--and move
into the shade! Remodel her--. Fool that I was!
