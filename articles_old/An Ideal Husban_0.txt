SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  You think science cannot grapple with the problem
of women?
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Science can never grapple with the irrational.  That is
why it has no future before it, in this world.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  And women represent the irrational.
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Well-dressed women do.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_With a polite bow_.]  I fear I could hardly agree
with you there.  But do sit down.  And now tell me, what makes you leave
your brilliant Vienna for our gloomy London--or perhaps the question is
indiscreet?
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Questions are never indiscreet.  Answers sometimes are.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Well, at any rate, may I know if it is politics or
pleasure?
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Politics are my only pleasure.  You see nowadays it is
not fashionable to flirt till one is forty, or to be romantic till one is
forty-five, so we poor women who are under thirty, or say we are, have
nothing open to us but politics or philanthropy.  And philanthropy seems
to me to have become simply the refuge of people who wish to annoy their
fellow-creatures.  I prefer politics.  I think they are more . . .
becoming!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  A political life is a noble career!
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Sometimes.  And sometimes it is a clever game, Sir
Robert.  And sometimes it is a great nuisance.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Which do you find it?
MRS. CHEVELEY.  I?  A combination of all three.  [_Drops her fan_.]
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Picks up fan_.]  Allow me!
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Thanks.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  But you have not told me yet what makes you honour
London so suddenly.  Our season is almost over.
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Oh! I don't care about the London season!  It is too
matrimonial.  People are either hunting for husbands, or hiding from
them.  I wanted to meet you.  It is quite true.  You know what a woman's
curiosity is.  Almost as great as a man's!  I wanted immensely to meet
you, and . . . to ask you to do something for me.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I hope it is not a little thing, Mrs. Cheveley.  I
find that little things are so very difficult to do.
MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_After a moment's reflection_.]  No, I don't think it is
quite a little thing.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I am so glad.  Do tell me what it is.
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Later on.  [_Rises_.]  And now may I walk through your
beautiful house?  I hear your pictures are charming.  Poor Baron
Arnheim--you remember the Baron?--used to tell me you had some wonderful
Corots.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_With an almost imperceptible start_.]  Did you
know Baron Arnheim well?
MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_Smiling_.]  Intimately.  Did you?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  At one time.
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Wonderful man, wasn't he?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_After a pause_.]  He was very remarkable, in many
ways.
MRS. CHEVELEY.  I often think it such a pity he never wrote his memoirs.
They would have been most interesting.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Yes: he knew men and cities well, like the old
Greek.
