[Offering to kiss her.]
MARIA.
Not so, gentle beast.
My lips are no common, though several they be.
BOYET.
Belonging to whom?
MARIA.
To my fortunes and me.
PRINCESS.
Good wits will be jangling; but, gentles, agree;
This civil war of wits were much better us'd
On Navarre and his book-men, for here 'tis abus'd.
BOYET.
If my observation,--which very seldom lies,
By the heart's still rhetoric disclosed with eyes,
Deceive me not now, Navarre is infected.
PRINCESS.
With what?
BOYET.
With that which we lovers entitle affected.
PRINCESS.
Your reason.
BOYET.
Why, all his behaviours did make their retire
To the court of his eye, peeping thorough desire;
His heart, like an agate, with your print impress'd,
Proud with his form, in his eye pride express'd;
His tongue, all impatient to speak and not see,
Did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be;
All senses to that sense did make their repair,
To feel only looking on fairest of fair.
Methought all his senses were lock'd in his eye,
As jewels in crystal for some prince to buy;
Who, tend'ring their own worth from where they were glass'd,
Did point you to buy them, along as you pass'd.
His face's own margent did quote such amazes
That all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes.
I'll give you Aquitaine, and all that is his,
An you give him for my sake but one loving kiss.
PRINCESS.
Come, to our pavilion: Boyet is dispos'd.
BOYET.
But to speak that in words which his eye hath disclos'd.
I only have made a mouth of his eye,
By adding a tongue which I know will not lie.
ROSALINE.
Thou art an old love-monger, and speak'st skilfully.
MARIA.
He is Cupid's grandfather, and learns news of him.
ROSALINE.
Then was Venus like her mother; for her father is but grim.
BOYET.
Do you hear, my mad wenches?
MARIA.
No.
BOYET.
What, then, do you see?
ROSALINE.
Ay, our way to be gone.
BOYET.
You are too hard for me.
[Exeunt.]
ACT III.
SCENE I.  The King of Navarre's park.
[Enter ARMADO and MOTH.]
ARMADO.
Warble, child; make passionate my sense of hearing.
MOTH [Singing.]
Concolinel,--
ARMADO.
Sweet air! Go, tenderness of years; take this key, give
enlargement to the swain, bring him festinately hither; I must
employ him in a letter to my love.
MOTH.
Master, will you win your love with a French brawl?
ARMADO.
How meanest thou? brawling in French?
MOTH.
No, my complete master; but to jig off a tune at the tongue's
end, canary to it with your feet, humour it with turning up your
eyelids, sigh a note and sing a note, sometime through the
throat, as if you swallowed love with singing love, sometime
through the nose, as if you snuffed up love by smelling love;
with your hat penthouse-like o'er the shop of your eyes, with
your arms crossed on your thin-belly doublet, like a rabbit on a
spit; or your hands in your pocket, like a man after the old
painting; and keep not too long in one tune, but a snip and away.
These are complements, these are humours; these betray nice
wenches, that would be betrayed without these; and make them men
of note,--do you note me?--that most are affected to these.
