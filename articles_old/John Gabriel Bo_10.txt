ELLA RENTHEIM.
  I found I had to, Erhart.
ERHART.
  Indeed?  Why so?
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  I had to come to town after all, to consult the doctors.
ERHART.
  Oh, I'm glad of that!
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Smiling.]  Are you glad of that?
ERHART.
  I mean I am glad you made up your mind to it at last.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  [On the sofa, coldly.]  Are you ill, Ella?
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Looking hardly at her.]  You know quite well that I am ill.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  I knew you were not strong, and hadn't been for years.
ERHART.
  I told you before I left you that you ought to consult a doctor.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  There is no one in my neighbourhood that I have any real
confidence in.  And, besides, I did not feel it so much at
that time.
ERHART.
  Are you worse, then, Aunt?
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Yes, my dear boy; I am worse now.
ERHART.
  But there's nothing dangerous?
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Oh, that depends how you look at it.
ERHART.
  [Emphatically.]  Well, then, I tell you what it is, Aunt Ella;
you mustn't think of going home again for the present.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  No, I am not thinking of it.
ERHART.
  You must remain in town; for here you can have your choice of
all the best doctors.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  That was what I thought when I left home.
ERHART.
  And then you must be sure and find a really nice place to live--
quiet, comfortable rooms.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  I went this morning to the old ones, where I used to stay before.
ERHART.
  Oh, well, you were comfortable enough there.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Yes, but I shall not be staying there after all.
ERHART.
  Indeed?  Why not?
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  I changed my mind after coming out here.
ERHART.
  [Surprised.]  Really?  Changed you mind?
MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Crocheting; without looking up.]  Your aunt will live here, in
her own house, Erhart.
ERHART.
  [Looking from one to the other alternately.]  Here, with us?  Is
this true, Aunt?
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Yes, that is what I made up my mind to do.
MRS. BORKMAN.
  [As before.]  Everything here belongs to your aunt, you know.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  I intend to remain here, Erhart--just now--for the present.
I shall set up a little establishment of my own, over in the
bailiff's wing.
ERHART.
  Ah, that's a good idea.  There are plenty of rooms there.  [With
sudden vivacity.]  But, by-the-bye, Aunt--aren't you very tired
after your journey?
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Oh yes, rather tired.
ERHART.
  Well, then, I think you ought to go quite early to bed.
ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Looks at him smilingly.]  I mean to.
ERHART.
  [Eagerly.]  And then we could have a good long talk to-morrow--
or some other day, of course--about this and that--about things
in general--you and mother and I.  Wouldn't that be much the
best plan, Aunt Ella?
MRS. BORKMAN.
  [With an outburst, rising from the sofa.]  Erhart, I can see you
are going to leave me!
ERHART.
  [Starts.]  What do you mean by that?
MRS. BORKMAN.
  You are going down to--to the Hinkels'?
