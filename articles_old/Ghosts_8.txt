[OSWALD ALVING, in a light overcoat, hat in hand, and smoking a large
meerschaum, enters by the door on the left; he stops in the doorway.]
OSWALD. Oh, I beg your pardon; I thought you were in the study. [Comes
forward.] Good-morning, Pastor Manders.
MANDERS. [Staring.] Ah--! How strange--!
MRS. ALVING. Well now, what do you think of him, Mr. Manders?
MANDERS. I--I--can it really be--?
OSWALD. Yes, it's really the Prodigal Son, sir.
MANDERS. [Protesting.] My dear young friend--
OSWALD. Well, then, the Lost Sheep Found.
MRS. ALVING. Oswald is thinking of the time when you were so much
opposed to his becoming a painter.
MANDERS. To our human eyes many a step seems dubious, which afterwards
proves--[Wrings his hand.] But first of all, welcome, welcome home! Do
not think, my dear Oswald--I suppose I may call you by your Christian
name?
OSWALD. What else should you call me?
MANDERS. Very good. What I wanted to say was this, my dear Oswald you
must not think that I utterly condemn the artist's calling. I have no
doubt there are many who can keep their inner self unharmed in that
profession, as in any other.
OSWALD. Let us hope so.
MRS. ALVING. [Beaming with delight.] I know one who has kept both his
inner and his outer self unharmed. Just look at him, Mr. Manders.
OSWALD. [Moves restlessly about the room.] Yes, yes, my dear mother;
let's say no more about it.
MANDERS. Why, certainly--that is undeniable. And you have begun to make
a name for yourself already. The newspapers have often spoken of you,
most favourably. Just lately, by-the-bye, I fancy I haven't seen your
name quite so often.
OSWALD. [Up in the conservatory.] I haven't been able to paint so much
lately.
MRS. ALVING. Even a painter needs a little rest now and then.
MANDERS. No doubt, no doubt. And meanwhile he can be preparing himself
and mustering his forces for some great work.
OSWALD. Yes.--Mother, will dinner soon be ready?
MRS. ALVING. In less than half an hour. He has a capital appetite, thank
God.
MANDERS. And a taste for tobacco, too.
OSWALD. I found my father's pipe in my room--
MANDERS. Aha--then that accounts for it!
MRS. ALVING. For what?
MANDERS. When Oswald appeared there, in the doorway, with the pipe in
his mouth, I could have sworn I saw his father, large as life.
OSWALD. No, really?
MRS. ALVING. Oh, how can you say so? Oswald takes after me.
MANDERS. Yes, but there is an expression about the corners of the
mouth--something about the lips--that reminds one exactly of Alving: at
any rate, now that he is smoking.
MRS. ALVING. Not in the least. Oswald has rather a clerical curve about
his mouth, I think.
MANDERS. Yes, yes; some of my colleagues have much the same expression.
MRS. ALVING. But put your pipe away, my dear boy; I won't have smoking
in here.
OSWALD. [Does so.] By all means. I only wanted to try it; for I once
smoked it when I was a child.
