ACT III.
_SCENE I. Before the house of _ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus_._
  _Enter _ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus_, _DROMIO of Ephesus_, ANGELO,
  and BALTHAZAR._
_Ant. E._ Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all;
My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours:
Say that I linger'd with you at your shop
To see the making of her carcanet,
And that to-morrow you will bring it home.                           5
But here's a villain that would face me down
He met me on the mart, and that I beat him,
And charged him with a thousand marks in gold,
And that I did deny my wife and house.
Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?                  10
_Dro. E._ Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know;
That you beat me at the mart, I have your hand to show:
If the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink,
Your own handwriting would tell you what I think.
_Ant. E._ I think thou art an ass.
_Dro. E._                      Marry, so it doth appear             15
By the wrongs I suffer, and the blows I bear.
I should kick, being kick'd; and, being at that pass,
You would keep from my heels, and beware of an ass.
_Ant. E._ You're sad, Signior Balthazar: pray God our cheer
May answer my good will and your good welcome here.                 20
_Bal._ I hold your dainties cheap, sir, and your welcome dear.
_Ant. E._ O, Signior Balthazar, either at flesh or fish,
A table full of welcome makes scarce one dainty dish.
_Bal._ Good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords.
_Ant. E._ And welcome more common; for that's nothing but words.    25
_Bal._ Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast.
_Ant. E._ Ay to a niggardly host and more sparing guest:
But though my cates be mean, take them in good part;
Better cheer may you have, but not with better heart.
But, soft! my door is lock'd.--Go bid them let us in.               30
_Dro. E._ Maud, Bridget, Marian, Cicely, Gillian, Ginn!
_Dro. S._ [_Within_] Mome, malt-horse, capon, coxcomb,
        idiot, patch!
Either get thee from the door, or sit down at the hatch.
Dost thou conjure for wenches, that thou call'st for such store,
When one is one too many? Go get thee from the door,                35
_Dro. E._ What patch is made our porter? My master stays
        in the street.
_Dro. S._ [_Within_] Let him walk from whence he came, lest he
        catch cold on's feet.
_Ant. E._ Who talks within there? ho, open the door!
_Dro. S._ [_Within_] Right, sir; I'll tell you when, an you'll
        tell me wherefore.
_Ant. E._ Wherefore? for my dinner: I have not dined to-day.        40
_Dro. S._ [_Within_] Nor to-day here you must not; come again
        when you may.
_Ant. E._ What art thou that keepest me out from the house I owe?
_Dro. S._ [_Within_] The porter for this time, sir, and
        my name is Dromio.
_Dro. E._ O villain, thou hast stolen both mine office
        and my name!
The one ne'er got me credit, the other mickle blame.                45
If thou hadst been Dromio to-day in my place,
Thou wouldst have changed thy face for a name, or thy name
        for an ass.
