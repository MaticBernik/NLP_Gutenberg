   But when oer wastes of lily-haunted field
      The tired birds had stayed their amorous tune,
   And broad and glittering like an argent shield
      High in the sapphire heavens hung the moon,
   Did no strange dream or evil memory make
   Each tremulous petal of its blossoms shake?
   Ah no! to this bright flower a thousand years
      Seemed but the lingering of a summers day,
   It never knew the tide of cankering fears
      Which turn a boys gold hair to withered grey,
   The dread desire of death it never knew,
   Or how all folk that they were born must rue.
   For we to death with pipe and dancing go,
      Nor would we pass the ivory gate again,
   As some sad river wearied of its flow
      Through the dull plains, the haunts of common men,
   Leaps lover-like into the terrible sea!
   And counts it gain to die so gloriously.
   We mar our lordly strength in barren strife
      With the worlds legions led by clamorous care,
   It never feels decay but gathers life
      From the pure sunlight and the supreme air,
   We live beneath Times wasting sovereignty,
   It is the child of all eternity.
SERENADE
                               (FOR MUSIC)
   THE western wind is blowing fair
      Across the dark Agean sea,
   And at the secret marble stair
      My Tyrian galley waits for thee.
   Come down! the purple sail is spread,
      The watchman sleeps within the town,
   O leave thy lily-flowered bed,
      O Lady mine come down, come down!
   She will not come, I know her well,
      Of lovers vows she hath no care,
   And little good a man can tell
      Of one so cruel and so fair.
   True love is but a womans toy,
      They never know the lovers pain,
   And I who loved as loves a boy
      Must love in vain, must love in vain.
   O noble pilot, tell me true,
      Is that the sheen of golden hair?
   Or is it but the tangled dew
      That binds the passion-flowers there?
   Good sailor come and tell me now
      Is that my Ladys lily hand?
   Or is it but the gleaming prow,
      Or is it but the silver sand?
   No! no! tis not the tangled dew,
      Tis not the silver-fretted sand,
   It is my own dear Lady true
      With golden hair and lily hand!
   O noble pilot, steer for Troy,
      Good sailor, ply the labouring oar,
   This is the Queen of life and joy
      Whom we must bear from Grecian shore!
   The waning sky grows faint and blue,
      It wants an hour still of day,
   Aboard! aboard! my gallant crew,
      O Lady mine, away! away!
   O noble pilot, steer for Troy,
      Good sailor, ply the labouring oar,
   O loved as only loves a boy!
      O loved for ever evermore!
ENDYMION
                               (FOR MUSIC)
   THE apple trees are hung with gold,
      And birds are loud in Arcady,
   The sheep lie bleating in the fold,
   The wild goat runs across the wold,
   But yesterday his love he told,
      I know he will come back to me.
   O rising moon!  O Lady moon!
      Be you my lovers sentinel,
      You cannot choose but know him well,
   For he is shod with purple shoon,
   You cannot choose but know my love,
      For he a shepherds crook doth bear,
   And he is soft as any dove,
      And brown and curly is his hair.
