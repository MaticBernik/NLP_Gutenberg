[Exit.]
PORTIA.
I must go in.--[Aside.] Ah me, how weak a thing
The heart of woman is!--O Brutus,
The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise!--
Sure, the boy heard me.--Brutus hath a suit
That Caesar will not grant.--O, I grow faint.--
Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
Say I am merry: come to me again,
And bring me word what he doth say to thee.
[Exeunt.]
ACT III.
SCENE I. Rome. Before the Capitol; the Senate sitting.
[A crowd of people in the street leading to the Capitol, among
them Artemidorus and the Soothsayer. Flourish. Enter Caesar,
Brutus, Cassius, Casca, Decius, Metellus, Trebonius, Cinna,
Antony, Lepidus, Popilius, Publius, and others.]
CAESAR.
The Ides of March are come.
SOOTHSAYER.
Ay, Caesar; but not gone.
ARTEMIDORUS.
Hail, Caesar! read this schedule.
DECIUS.
Trebonius doth desire you to o'er-read,
At your best leisure, this his humble suit.
ARTEMIDORUS.
O Caesar, read mine first; for mine's a suit
That touches Caesar nearer: read it, great Caesar.
CAESAR.
What touches us ourself shall be last served.
ARTEMIDORUS.
Delay not, Caesar; read it instantly.
CAESAR.
What, is the fellow mad?
PUBLIUS.
Sirrah, give place.
CASSIUS.
What, urge you your petitions in the street?
Come to the Capitol.
[Caesar enters the Capitol, the rest following. All the Senators
rise.]
POPILIUS.
I wish your enterprise to-day may thrive.
CASSIUS.
What enterprise, Popilius?
POPILIUS.
Fare you well.
Advances to Caesar.
BRUTUS.
What said Popilius Lena?
CASSIUS.
He wish'd to-day our enterprise might thrive.
I fear our purpose is discovered.
BRUTUS.
Look, how he makes to Caesar: mark him.
CASSIUS.
Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention.--
Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known,
Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back,
For I will slay myself.
BRUTUS.
Cassius, be constant:
Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes;
For, look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change.
CASSIUS.
Trebonius knows his time, for, look you, Brutus,
He draws Mark Antony out of the way.
[Exeunt Antony and Trebonius. Caesar and the Senators take their
seats.]
DECIUS.
Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go,
And presently prefer his suit to Caesar.
BRUTUS.
He is address'd; press near and second him.
CINNA.
Casca, you are the first that rears your hand.
CASCA.
Are we all ready?
CAESAR.
What is now amiss
That Caesar and his Senate must redress?
METELLUS.
Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar,
Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat
An humble heart.
[Kneeling.]
CAESAR.
I must prevent thee, Cimber.
These couchings and these lowly courtesies
Might fire the blood of ordinary men,
And turn pre-ordinance and first decree
Into the law of children. Be not fond,
To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood
That will be thaw'd from the true quality
With that which melteth fools; I mean, sweet words,
Low-crooked curtsies, and base spaniel-fawning.
Thy brother by decree is banished:
If thou dost bend, and pray, and fawn for him,
I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.
METELLUS.
Caesar, thou dost me wrong.
