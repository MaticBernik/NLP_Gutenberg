TALBOT.
Not all together:  better far, I guess,
That we do make our entrance several ways;
That, if it chance the one of us do fail,
The other yet may rise against their force.
BEDFORD.
Agreed:  I 'll to yond corner.
BURGUNDY.
And I to this.
TALBOT.
And here will Talbot mount, or make his grave.
Now, Salisbury, for thee, and for the right
Of English Henry, shall this night appear
How much in duty I am bound to both.
SENTINEL.
Arm! arm! the enemy doth make assault!
[Cry:  'St George,' 'A Talbot.']
[The French leap over the walls in their shirts.
Enter, several ways, the Bastard of Orleans, Alencon, and
Reignier, half ready, and half unready.]
ALENCON.
How now, my lords! what, all unready so?
BASTARD.
Unready! aye, and glad we 'scap'd so well.
REIGNIER.
'Twas time, I trow, to wake and leave our beds,
Hearing alarums at our chamber-doors.
ALENCON.
Of all exploits since first I follow'd arms,
Ne'er heard I of a warlike enterprise
More venturous or desperate than this.
BASTARD.
I think this Talbot be a fiend of hell.
REIGNIER.
If not of hell, the heavens, sure, favor him.
ALENCON.
Here cometh Charles:  I marvel how he sped.
BASTARD.
Tut, holy Joan was his defensive guard.
[Enter Charles and La Pucelle.]
CHARLES.
Is this thy cunning, thou deceitful dame?
Didst thou at first, to flatter us withal,
Make us partakers of a little gain,
That now our loss might be ten times so much?
PUCELLE.
Wherefore is Charles impatient with his friend?
At all times will you have my power alike?
Sleeping or waking must I still prevail,
Or will you blame and lay the fault on me?
Improvident soldiers! had your watch been good,
This sudden mischief never could have fall'n.
CHARLES.
Duke of Alencon, this was your default,
That, being captain of the watch to-night,
Did look no better to that weighty charge.
ALENCON.
Had all your quarters been as safely kept
As that whereof I had the government,
We had not been thus shamefully surprised.
BASTARD.
Mine was secure.
REIGNIER.
And so was mine, my lord.
CHARLES.
And, for myself, most part of all this night,
Within her quarter and mine own precinct
I was employ'd in passing to and fro,
About relieving of the sentinels:
Then how or which way should they first break in?
PUCELLE.
Question, my lords, no further of the case,
How or which way:  'tis sure they found some place
But weakly guarded, where the breach was made.
And now there rests no other shift but this;
To gather our soldiers, scatter'd and dispersed,
And lay new platforms to endamage them.
[Alarum. Enter an English Soldier, crying
'A Talbot! a Talbot!'  They fly, leaving their
clothes behind.]
SOLDIER.
I 'll be so bold to take what they have left.
The cry of Talbot serves me for a sword;
For I have loaden me with many spoils,
Using no other weapon but his name.
[Exit.]
