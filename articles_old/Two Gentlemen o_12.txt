SCENE V. _The same. A street._
  _Enter SPEED and LAUNCE severally._
_Speed._ Launce! by mine honesty, welcome to Padua!
_Launce._ Forswear not thyself, sweet youth; for I am not
welcome. I reckon this always--that a man is never undone
till he be hanged; nor never welcome to a place till
some certain shot be paid, and the hostess say 'Welcome!'            5
_Speed._ Come on, you madcap, I'll to the alehouse with
you presently; where, for one shot of five pence, thou shalt
have five thousand welcomes. But, sirrah, how did thy
master part with Madam Julia?
_Launce._ Marry, after they closed in earnest, they parted          10
very fairly in jest.
_Speed._ But shall she marry him?
_Launce._ No.
_Speed._ How, then? shall he marry her?
_Launce._ No, neither.                                              15
_Speed._ What, are they broken?
_Launce._ No, they are both as whole as a fish.
_Speed._ Why, then, how stands the matter with them?
