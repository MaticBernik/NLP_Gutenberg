Y.M. What do you call Love, Hate, Charity, Revenge, Humanity,
Magnanimity, Forgiveness?
O.M. Different results of the one Master Impulse: the necessity of
securing one's self approval. They wear diverse clothes and are subject
to diverse moods, but in whatsoever ways they masquerade they are the
_same person_ all the time. To change the figure, the _compulsion_ that
moves a man--and there is but the one--is the necessity of securing the
contentment of his own spirit. When it stops, the man is dead.
Y.M. That is foolishness. Love--
O.M. Why, love is that impulse, that law, in its most uncompromising
form. It will squander life and everything else on its object. Not
_primarily_ for the object's sake, but for _its own_. When its object is
happy _it_ is happy--and that is what it is unconsciously after.
Y.M. You do not even except the lofty and gracious passion of
mother-love?
O.M. No, _it _is the absolute slave of that law. The mother will go
naked to clothe her child; she will starve that it may have food; suffer
torture to save it from pain; die that it may live. She takes a
living _pleasure_ in making these sacrifices. _She does it for that
reward_--that self-approval, that contentment, that peace, that comfort.
_She would do it for your child_ IF SHE COULD GET THE SAME PAY.
Y.M. This is an infernal philosophy of yours.
O.M. It isn't a philosophy, it is a fact.
Y.M. Of course you must admit that there are some acts which--
O.M. No. There is _no_ act, large or small, fine or mean, which springs
from any motive but the one--the necessity of appeasing and contenting
one's own spirit.
Y.M. The world's philanthropists--
O.M. I honor them, I uncover my head to them--from habit and training;
and _they_ could not know comfort or happiness or self-approval if they
did not work and spend for the unfortunate. It makes _them_ happy to
see others happy; and so with money and labor they buy what they are
after--_happiness, self-approval_. Why don't miners do the same thing?
Because they can get a thousandfold more happiness by _not_ doing it.
There is no other reason. They follow the law of their make.
Y.M. What do you say of duty for duty's sake?
O.M. That _it does not exist_. Duties are not performed for duty's
_sake_, but because their _neglect_ would make the man _uncomfortable_.
A man performs but _one_ duty--the duty of contenting his spirit, the
duty of making himself agreeable to himself. If he can most satisfyingly
perform this sole and only duty by _helping_ his neighbor, he will do
it; if he can most satisfyingly perform it by _swindling_ his neighbor,
he will do it. But he always looks out for Number One--_first_;
the effects upon others are a _secondary_ matter. Men pretend to
self-sacrifices, but this is a thing which, in the ordinary value of
the phrase, _does not exist and has not existed_. A man often honestly
_thinks_ he is sacrificing himself merely and solely for some one else,
but he is deceived; his bottom impulse is to content a requirement of
his nature and training, and thus acquire peace for his soul.
