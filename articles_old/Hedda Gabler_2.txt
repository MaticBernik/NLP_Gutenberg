MISS TESMAN.
Yes, you don't seem to have wasted your time on your wedding trip,
George.
TESMAN.
No, that I haven't. But do take off your bonnet, Auntie. Look here! Let
me untie the strings--eh?
MISS TESMAN.
[While he does so.] Well well--this is just as if you were still at home
with us.
TESMAN.
[With the bonnet in his hand, looks at it from all sides.] Why, what a
gorgeous bonnet you've been investing in!
MISS TESMAN.
I bought it on Hedda's account.
TESMAN.
On Hedda's account? Eh?
MISS TESMAN.
Yes, so that Hedda needn't be ashamed of me if we happened to go out
together.
TESMAN.
[Patting her cheek.] You always think of everything, Aunt Julia. [Lays
the bonnet on a chair beside the table.] And now, look here--suppose we
sit comfortably on the sofa and have a little chat, till Hedda comes.
     [They seat themselves.  She places her parasol in the corner
       of the sofa.
MISS TESMAN.
[Takes both his hands and looks at him.] What a delight it is to have
you again, as large as life, before my very eyes, George! My George--my
poor brother's own boy!
TESMAN.
And it's a delight for me, too, to see you again, Aunt Julia! You, who
have been father and mother in one to me.
MISS TESMAN.
Oh yes, I know you will always keep a place in your heart for your old
aunts.
TESMAN.
And what about Aunt Rina? No improvement--eh?
MISS TESMAN.
Oh, no--we can scarcely look for any improvement in her case, poor
thing. There she lies, helpless, as she has lain for all these years.
But heaven grant I may not lose her yet awhile! For if I did, I don't
know what I should make of my life, George--especially now that I
haven't you to look after any more.
TESMAN.
[Patting her back.] There there there--!
MISS TESMAN.
[Suddenly changing her tone.] And to think that here are you a married
man, George!--And that you should be the one to carry off Hedda Gabler
--the beautiful Hedda Gabler! Only think of it--she, that was so beset
with admirers!
TESMAN.
[Hums a little and smiles complacently.] Yes, I fancy I have several
good friends about town who would like to stand in my shoes--eh?
MISS TESMAN.
And then this fine long wedding-tour you have had! More than five--
nearly six months--
TESMAN.
Well, for me it has been a sort of tour of research as well. I have had
to do so much grubbing among old records--and to read no end of books
too, Auntie.
MISS TESMAN.
Oh yes, I suppose so. [More confidentially, and lowering her voice a
little.] But listen now, George,--have you nothing--nothing special to
tell me?
TESMAN.
As to our journey?
MISS TESMAN.
Yes.
TESMAN.
No, I don't know of anything except what I have told you in my letters.
I had a doctor's degree conferred on me--but that I told you yesterday.
MISS TESMAN.
Yes, yes, you did. But what I mean is--haven't you any--any--
expectations--?
