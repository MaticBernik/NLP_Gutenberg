MANDERS. And it is to this man that you raise a memorial?
MRS. ALVING. There you see the power of an evil conscience.
MANDERS. Evil--? What do you mean?
MRS. ALVING. It always seemed to me impossible but that the truth must
come out and be believed. So the Orphanage was to deaden all rumours and
set every doubt at rest.
MANDERS. In that you have certainly not missed your aim, Mrs. Alving.
MRS. ALVING. And besides, I had one other reason. I was determined that
Oswald, my own boy, should inherit nothing whatever from his father.
MANDERS. Then it is Alving's fortune that--?
MRS. ALVING. Yes. The sums I have spent upon the Orphanage, year by
year, make up the amount--I have reckoned it up precisely--the amount
which made Lieutenant Alving "a good match" in his day.
MANDERS. I don't understand--
MRS. ALVING. It was my purchase-money. I do not choose that that money
should pass into Oswald's hands. My son shall have everything from
me--everything.
[OSWALD ALVING enters through the second door to the right; he has taken
of his hat and overcoat in the hall.]
MRS. ALVING. [Going towards him.] Are you back again already? My dear,
dear boy!
OSWALD. Yes. What can a fellow do out of doors in this eternal rain? But
I hear dinner is ready. That's capital!
REGINA. [With a parcel, from the dining-room.] A parcel has come for
you, Mrs. Alving. [Hands it to her.]
MRS. ALVING. [With a glance at MR. MANDERS.] No doubt copies of the ode
for to-morrow's ceremony.
MANDERS. H'm--
REGINA. And dinner is ready.
MRS. ALVING. Very well. We will come directly. I will just--[Begins to
open the parcel.]
REGINA. [To OSWALD.] Would Mr. Alving like red or white wine?
OSWALD. Both, if you please.
REGINA. _Bien_. Very well, sir. [She goes into the dining-room.]
OSWALD. I may as well help to uncork it. [He also goes into the dining
room, the door of which swings half open behind him.]
MRS. ALVING. [Who has opened the parcel.] Yes, I thought so. Here is the
Ceremonial Ode, Pastor Manders.
MANDERS. [With folded hands.] With what countenance I am to deliver my
discourse to-morrow--!
MRS. ALVING. Oh, you will get through it somehow.
MANDERS. [Softly, so as not to be heard in the dining-room.] Yes; it
would not do to provoke scandal.
MRS. ALVING. [Under her breath, but firmly.] No. But then this long,
hateful comedy will be ended. From the day after to-morrow, I shall act
in every way as though he who is dead had never lived in this house.
There shall be no one here but my boy and his mother.
[From the dining-room comes the noise of a chair overturned, and at the
same moment is heard:]
REGINA. [Sharply, but in a whisper.] Oswald! take care! are you mad? Let
me go!
MRS. ALVING. [Starts in terror.] Ah--!
[She stares wildly towards the half-open door. OSWALD is heard laughing
and humming. A bottle is uncorked.]
