APEMANTUS.
There will little learning die, then, that day thou art
hanged. This is to Lord Timon; this to Alcibiades. Go; thou wast
born a bastard, and thou'lt die a bawd.
PAGE.
Thou wast whelped a dog, and thou shalt famish a dog's death.
Answer not; I am gone.
[Exit PAGE.]
APEMANTUS.
E'en so thou outrunn'st grace.--
Fool, I will go with you to Lord Timon's.
FOOL.
Will you leave me there?
APEMANTUS.
If Timon stay at home. You three serve three usurers?
ALL SERVANTS.
Ay; would they served us!
APEMANTUS.
So would I, as good a trick as ever hangman served thief.
FOOL.
Are you three usurers' men?
ALL SERVANTS.
Ay, fool.
FOOL.
I think no usurer but has a fool to his servant: my mistress
is one, and I am her fool. When men come to borrow of your
masters, they approach sadly, and go away merry; but they enter
my mistress' house merrily, and go away sadly: the reason of
this?
VARRO'S SERVANT.
I could render one.
APEMANTUS.
Do it, then, that we may account thee a whoremaster and a
knave; which notwithstanding, thou shalt be no less esteemed.
VARRO'S SERVANT.
What is a whoremaster, fool?
FOOL.
A fool in good clothes, and something like thee. 'Tis a
spirit: sometime 't appears like a lord; sometime like a lawyer;
sometime like a philosopher, with two stones more than's
artificial one. He is very often like a knight; and generally,
in all shapes that man goes up and down in from fourscore to
thirteen, this spirit walks in.
VARRO'S SERVANT.
Thou art not altogether a fool.
FOOL.
Nor thou altogether a wise man:
as much foolery as I have, so much wit thou lackest.
APEMANTUS.
That answer might have become Apemantus.
VARRO'S SERVANT.
Aside, aside; here comes Lord Timon.
[Re-enter TIMON and FLAVIUS.]
APEMANTUS.
Come with me, fool, come.
FOOL.
I do not always follow lover, elder brother, and woman;
sometime the philosopher.
[Exeunt APEMANTUS and FOOL.]
FLAVIUS.
Pray you walk near: I'll speak with you anon.
[Exeunt SERVANTS.]
TIMON.
You make me marvel: wherefore, ere this time,
Had you not fully laid my state before me,
That I might so have rated my expense
As I had leave of means?
FLAVIUS.
You would not hear me,
At many leisures I propos'd.
TIMON.
Go to:
Perchance some single vantages you took,
When my indisposition put you back;
And that unaptness made your minister
Thus to excuse yourself.
FLAVIUS.
O my good lord!
At many times I brought in my accounts,
Laid them before you; you would throw them off,
And say you found them in mine honesty.
When for some trifling present you have bid me
Return so much, I have shook my head, and wept;
Yea, 'gainst the authority of manners, pray'd you
To hold your hand more close: I did endure
Not seldom, nor no slight checks, when I have
Prompted you in the ebb of your estate
And your great flow of debts. My loved lord,
Though you hear now, too late, yet now's a time,
The greatest of your having lacks a half
To pay your present debts.
