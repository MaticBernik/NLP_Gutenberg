HERMIONE.
                             Sir, spare your threats:
The bug which you would fright me with, I seek.
To me can life be no commodity:
The crown and comfort of my life, your favour,
I do give lost; for I do feel it gone,
But know not how it went: my second joy,
And first-fruits of my body, from his presence
I am barr'd, like one infectious: my third comfort,
Starr'd most unluckily, is from my breast,--
The innocent milk in its most innocent mouth,--
Hal'd out to murder: myself on every post
Proclaim'd a strumpet; with immodest hatred
The child-bed privilege denied, which 'longs
To women of all fashion; lastly, hurried
Here to this place, i' the open air, before
I have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,
Tell me what blessings I have here alive,
That I should fear to die. Therefore proceed.
But yet hear this; mistake me not;--no life,--
I prize it not a straw,--but for mine honour
(Which I would free), if I shall be condemn'd
Upon surmises--all proofs sleeping else,
But what your jealousies awake--I tell you
'Tis rigour, and not law.--Your honours all,
I do refer me to the oracle:
Apollo be my judge!
FIRST LORD.
                    This your request
Is altogether just: therefore, bring forth,
And in Apollo's name, his oracle:
[Exeunt certain Officers.]
HERMIONE.
The Emperor of Russia was my father;
O that he were alive, and here beholding
His daughter's trial! that he did but see
The flatness of my misery; yet with eyes
Of pity, not revenge!
[Re-enter OFFICERS, with CLEOMENES and DION.]
OFFICER.
You here shall swear upon this sword of justice,
That you, Cleomenes and Dion, have
Been both at Delphos, and from thence have brought
This seal'd-up oracle, by the hand deliver'd
Of great Apollo's priest; and that since then,
You have not dar'd to break the holy seal,
Nor read the secrets in't.
CLEOMENES, DION.
                           All this we swear.
LEONTES.
Break up the seals and read.
OFFICER.
[Reads.] 'Hermione is chaste; Polixenes blameless; Camillo
a true subject; Leontes a jealous tyrant; his innocent babe
truly begotten; and the king shall live without an heir, if
that which is lost be not found.'
LORDS.
Now blessed be the great Apollo!
HERMIONE.
                                 Praised!
LEONTES.
Hast thou read truth?
OFFICER.
                      Ay, my lord; even so
As it is here set down.
LEONTES.
There is no truth at all i' the oracle:
The sessions shall proceed: this is mere falsehood!
[Enter a Servant hastily.]
SERVANT.
My lord the king, the king!
LEONTES.
                            What is the business?
SERVANT.
O sir, I shall be hated to report it:
The prince your son, with mere conceit and fear
Of the queen's speed, is gone.
LEONTES.
                               How! gone?
SERVANT.
                                          Is dead.
LEONTES.
Apollo's angry; and the heavens themselves
Do strike at my injustice.
[HERMIONE faints.]
                           How now there!
PAULINA.
This news is mortal to the queen:--Look down
And see what death is doing.
LEONTES.
                             Take her hence:
Her heart is but o'ercharg'd; she will recover.--
I have too much believ'd mine own suspicion:--
Beseech you tenderly apply to her
Some remedies for life.--
