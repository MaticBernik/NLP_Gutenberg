  _K. Hen._ May I with right and conscience make this claim?
  _Cant._ (R.C.) The sin upon my head, dread sovereign!
  For in the book of Numbers is it writ,--
  When the son dies, let the inheritance
  Descend unto the daughter. Gracious lord,
  Stand for your own; unwind your bloody flag;
  Look back unto your mighty ancestors:
  Go, my dread lord, to your great grandsire's tomb,
  From whom you claim; invoke his warlike spirit,
  And your great uncle's, Edward the black prince,
  Who on the French ground play'd a tragedy,
  Making defeat on the full power of France,
  Whiles his most mighty father on a hill
  Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp
  Forage in blood of French nobility.[12]
  _Ely._ (R.C.) Awake remembrance of these valiant dead,
  And with your puissant arm renew their feats:
  You are their heir; you sit upon their throne;
  The blood and courage, that renowned them,
  Runs in your veins; and my thrice-puissant liege
  Is in the very May-morn of his youth,
  Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises.
  _Exe._ (L.) Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth
  Do all expect that you should rouse yourself,
  As did the former lions of your blood.
  _West._ (L.) They know your grace hath cause, and means and might:
  So hath your highness;[13] never king of England
  Had nobles richer and more loyal subjects,
  Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England,
  And lie pavilion'd in the fields of France.
  _Cant._ O, let their bodies follow, my dear liege,
  With blood, and sword, and fire to win your right:
  In aid whereof we of the spiritualty
  Will raise your highness such a mighty sum,
  As never did the clergy at one time
  Bring in to any of your ancestors.
  _K. Hen._ We must not only arm to invade the French,
  But lay down our proportions to defend
  Against the Scot, who will make road upon us
  With all advantages.
  _Cant._ (R.C.) They of those marches,[14] gracious sovereign,
  Shall be a wall sufficient to defend
  Our inland from the pilfering borderers.
  Therefore to France, my liege.
  Divide your happy England into four;
  Whereof take you one quarter into France,
  And you withal shall make all Gallia shake.
  If we, with thrice that power left at home,
  Cannot defend our own door from the dog,
  Let us be worried, and our nation lose
  The name of hardiness and policy.
  _K. Hen._ Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin.
    [_Exit HERALD with LORDS, L.H._
  Now are we well resolv'd; and by Heaven's help,
  And yours, the noble sinews of our power,--
  France being ours, we'll bend it to our awe,
  Or break it all to pieces.
    _Re-enter HERALD and Lords, L.H., with the AMBASSADOR of FRANCE,
    French Bishops, Gentlemen, and Attendants carrying a treasure
    chest, L.H._
  Now are we well prepar'd to know the pleasure
  Of our fair cousin Dauphin; for we hear
  Your greeting is from him, not from the king.
  _Amb._ (L.C.) May it please your majesty to give us leave
  Freely to render what we have in charge;
  Or shall we sparingly show you far off
  The Dauphin's meaning and our embassy?
