_Page._ 'Tis true, Master Shallow.                                  45
_Shal._ It will be found so, Master Page. Master Doctor
Caius, I am come to fetch you home. I am sworn of
the peace: you have shewed yourself a wise physician,
and Sir Hugh hath shewn himself a wise and patient
churchman. You must go with me, master doctor.                      50
