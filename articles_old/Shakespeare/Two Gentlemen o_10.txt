_Val._ Why, lady, Love hath twenty pair of eyes.
_Thu._ They say that Love hath not an eye at all.
_Val._ To see such lovers, Thurio, as yourself:
Upon a homely object Love can wink.
_Sil._ Have done, have done; here comes the gentleman.              95
  _Enter PROTEUS.    [Exit THURIO._
_Val._ Welcome, dear Proteus! Mistress, I beseech you,
Confirm his welcome with some special favour.
_Sil._ His worth is warrant for his welcome hither,
If this be he you oft have wish'd to hear from.
_Val._ Mistress, it is: sweet lady, entertain him                  100
To be my fellow-servant to your ladyship.
_Sil._ Too low a mistress for so high a servant.
_Pro._ Not so, sweet lady: but too mean a servant
To have a look of such a worthy mistress.
_Val._ Leave off discourse of disability:                          105
Sweet lady, entertain him for your servant.
_Pro._ My duty will I boast of; nothing else.
_Sil._ And duty never yet did want his meed:
Servant, you are welcome to a worthless mistress.
_Pro._ I'll die on him that says so but yourself.                  110
_Sil._ That you are welcome?
_Pro._                     That you are worthless.
  _Re-enter THURIO._
_Thu._ Madam, my lord your father would speak with you.
_Sil._ I wait upon his pleasure. Come, Sir Thurio,
Go with me. Once more, new servant, welcome:
I'll leave you to confer of home affairs;                          115
When you have done, we look to hear from you.
_Pro._ We'll both attend upon your ladyship.
    [_Exeunt Silvia and Thurio._
_Val._ Now, tell me, how do all from whence you came?
_Pro._ Your friends are well, and have them much commended.
_Val._ And how do yours?
_Pro._                 I left them all in health.                  120
_Val._ How does your lady? and how thrives your love?
_Pro._ My tales of love were wont to weary you;
I know you joy not in a love-discourse.
_Val._ Ay, Proteus, but that life is alter'd now:
I have done penance for contemning Love,                           125
Whose high imperious thoughts have punish'd me
With bitter fasts, with penitential groans,
With nightly tears, and daily heart-sore sighs;
For, in revenge of my contempt of love,
Love hath chased sleep from my enthralled eyes,                    130
And made them watchers of mine own heart's sorrow.
O gentle Proteus, Love's a mighty lord,
And hath so humbled me; as I confess
There is no woe to his correction,
Nor to his service no such joy on earth.                           135
Now no discourse, except it be of love;
Now can I break my fast, dine, sup and sleep,
Upon the very naked name of love.
_Pro._ Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.
Was this the idol that you worship so?                             140
_Val._ Even she; and is she not a heavenly saint?
_Pro._ No; but she is an earthly paragon.
_Val._ Call her divine.
_Pro._                I will not flatter her.
_Val._ O, flatter me; for love delights in praises.
_Pro._ When I was sick, you gave me bitter pills;                  145
And I must minister the like to you.
