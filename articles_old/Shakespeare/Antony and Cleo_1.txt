ANTONY.
The business she hath broached in the state
Cannot endure my absence.
ENOBARBUS.
And the business you have broached here cannot be without you;
especially that of Cleopatra's, which wholly depends on your
abode.
ANTONY.
No more light answers. Let our officers
Have notice what we purpose. I shall break
The cause of our expedience to the queen,
And get her leave to part. For not alone
The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,
Do strongly speak to us; but the letters too
Of many our contriving friends in Rome
Petition us at home: Sextus Pompeius
Hath given the dare to Caesar, and commands
The empire of the sea; our slippery people,--
Whose love is never link'd to the deserver
Till his deserts are past,--begin to throw
Pompey the Great, and all his dignities,
Upon his son; who, high in name and power,
Higher than both in blood and life, stands up
For the main soldier: whose quality, going on,
The sides o' the world may danger: much is breeding
Which, like the courser's hair, hath yet but life
And not a serpent's poison. Say, our pleasure
To such whose place is under us, requires
Our quick remove from hence.
ENOBARBUS.
I shall do't.
[Exeunt.]
SCENE III. Alexandria. A Room in CLEOPATRA'S palace.
[Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS.]
CLEOPATRA.
Where is he?
CHARMIAN.
I did not see him since.
CLEOPATRA.
See where he is, who's with him, what he does:--
I did not send you:--if you find him sad,
Say I am dancing; if in mirth, report
That I am sudden sick: quick, and return.
[Exit ALEXAS.]
CHARMIAN.
Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly,
You do not hold the method to enforce
The like from him.
CLEOPATRA.
What should I do, I do not?
CHARMIAN.
In each thing give him way; cross him in nothing.
CLEOPATRA.
Thou teachest like a fool,--the way to lose him.
CHARMIAN.
Tempt him not so too far; I wish, forbear;
In time we hate that which we often fear.
But here comes Antony.
[Enter ANTONY.]
CLEOPATRA.
I am sick and sullen.
ANTONY.
I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose,--
CLEOPATRA.
Help me away, dear Charmian; I shall fall;
It cannot be thus long, the sides of nature
Will not sustain it.
ANTONY.
Now, my dearest queen,--
CLEOPATRA.
Pray you, stand farther from me.
ANTONY.
What's the matter?
CLEOPATRA.
I know by that same eye there's some good news.
What says the married woman?--You may go.
Would she had never given you leave to come!
Let her not say 'tis I that keep you here,--
I have no power upon you; hers you are.
ANTONY.
The gods best know,--
CLEOPATRA.
O, never was there queen
So mightily betray'd! Yet at the first
I saw the treasons planted.
ANTONY.
Cleopatra,--
CLEOPATRA.
Why should I think you can be mine and true,
Though you in swearing shake the throned gods,
Who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness,
To be entangled with those mouth-made vows,
Which break themselves in swearing!
