ROSALIND.
Jove, Jove! this shepherd's passion
Is much upon my fashion.
TOUCHSTONE.
And mine: but it grows something stale with me.
CELIA.
I pray you, one of you question yond man
If he for gold will give us any food:
I faint almost to death.
TOUCHSTONE.
Holla, you clown!
ROSALIND.
Peace, fool; he's not thy kinsman.
CORIN.
Who calls?
TOUCHSTONE.
Your betters, sir.
CORIN.
Else are they very wretched.
ROSALIND.
Peace, I say.--
Good even to you, friend.
CORIN.
And to you, gentle sir, and to you all.
ROSALIND.
I pr'ythee, shepherd, if that love or gold
Can in this desert place buy entertainment,
Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed:
Here's a young maid with travel much oppress'd,
And faints for succour.
CORIN.
Fair sir, I pity her,
And wish, for her sake more than for mine own,
My fortunes were more able to relieve her:
But I am shepherd to another man,
And do not shear the fleeces that I graze:
My master is of churlish disposition,
And little recks to find the way to heaven
By doing deeds of hospitality:
Besides, his cote, his flocks, and bounds of feed,
Are now on sale; and at our sheepcote now,
By reason of his absence, there is nothing
That you will feed on; but what is, come see,
And in my voice most welcome shall you be.
ROSALIND.
What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?
CORIN.
That young swain that you saw here but erewhile,
That little cares for buying anything.
ROSALIND.
I pray thee, if it stand with honesty,
Buy thou the cottage, pasture, and the flock,
And thou shalt have to pay for it of us.
CELIA.
And we will mend thy wages. I like this place,
And willingly could waste my time in it.
CORIN.
Assuredly the thing is to be sold:
Go with me: if you like, upon report,
The soil, the profit, and this kind of life,
I will your very faithful feeder be,
And buy it with your gold right suddenly.
[Exeunt.]
SCENE V. Another part of the Forest.
[Enter AMIENS, JAQUES, and others.]
AMIENS.
        SONG
    Under the greenwood tree,
    Who loves to lie with me,
    And turn his merry note
    Unto the sweet bird's throat,
 Come hither, come hither, come hither;
    Here shall he see
    No enemy
 But winter and rough weather.
JAQUES.
More, more, I pr'ythee, more.
AMIENS.
It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques.
JAQUES.
I thank it. More, I pr'ythee, more. I can suck melancholy
out of a song, as a weasel sucks eggs. More, I pr'ythee, more.
AMIENS.
My voice is ragged; I know I cannot please you.
JAQUES.
I do not desire you to please me; I do desire you to sing.
Come, more: another stanza. Call you them stanzas?
AMIENS.
What you will, Monsieur Jaques.
JAQUES.
Nay, I care not for their names; they owe me nothing.
Will you sing?
AMIENS.
More at your request than to please myself.
JAQUES.
Well then, if ever I thank any man, I'll thank you: but
that they call compliment is like the encounter of two dog-apes;
and when a man thanks me heartily, methinks have given him a
penny, and he renders me the beggarly thanks. Come, sing; and
you that will not, hold your tongues.
