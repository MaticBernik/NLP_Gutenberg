CHAMBERLAIN.
O, 'tis true:
This night he makes a supper, and a great one,
To many lords and ladies; there will be
The beauty of this kingdom, I'll assure you.
LOVELL.
That churchman bears a bounteous mind indeed,
A hand as fruitful as the land that feeds us;
His dews fall everywhere.
CHAMBERLAIN.
No doubt he's noble;
He had a black mouth that said other of him.
SANDYS.
He may, my lord; has wherewithal; in him
Sparing would show a worse sin than ill doctrine.
Men of his way should be most liberal;
They are set here for examples.
CHAMBERLAIN.
True, they are so;
But few now give so great ones. My barge stays;
Your lordship shall along. Come, good Sir Thomas,
We shall be late else; which I would not be,
For I was spoke to, with Sir Henry Guildford,
This night to be comptrollers.
SANDYS.
I am your lordship's.
[Exeunt.]
SCENE IV. A Hall in York Place.
[Hautboys. A small table under a state for the Cardinal,
a longer table for the guests. Then enter Anne Bullen
and divers other Ladies and Gentlemen as guests, at one
door; at another door, enter Sir Henry Guildford.]
GUILDFORD.
Ladies, a general welcome from his Grace
Salutes ye all; this night he dedicates
To fair content and you. None here, he hopes,
In all this noble bevy, has brought with her
One care abroad.  He would have all as merry
As, first, good company, good wine, good welcome,
Can make good people.
[Enter Lord Chamberlain, Lord Sandys, and Sir Thomas Lovell.]
O, my lord, you're tardy;
The very thought of this fair company
Clapp'd wings to me.
CHAMBERLAIN.
You are young, Sir Harry Guildford.
SANDYS.
Sir Thomas Lovell, had the Cardinal
But half my lay thoughts in him, some of these
Should find a running banquet ere they rested,
I think would better please 'em. By my life,
They are a sweet society of fair ones.
LOVELL.
O, that your lordship were but now confessor
To one or two of these!
SANDYS.
I would I were;
They should find easy penance.
LOVELL.
Faith, how easy?
SANDYS.
As easy as a down-bed would afford it.
CHAMBERLAIN.
Sweet ladies, will it please you sit? Sir Harry,
Place you that side; I'll take the charge of this.
His Grace is ent'ring. Nay, you must not freeze;
Two women plac'd together makes cold weather.
My Lord Sandys, you are one will keep 'em waking;
Pray, sit between these ladies.
SANDYS.
By my faith,
And thank your lordship. By your leave, sweet ladies.
If I chance to talk a little wild, forgive me;
I had it from my father.
ANNE.
Was he mad, sir?
SANDYS.
O, very mad, exceeding mad; in love too;
But he would bite none.  Just as I do now,
He would kiss you twenty with a breath.
[Kisses her.]
CHAMBERLAIN.
Well said, my lord.
So, now you're fairly seated. Gentlemen,
The penance lies on you, if these fair ladies
Pass away frowning.
