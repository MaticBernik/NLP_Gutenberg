PLANTAGENET.
Thy humble servant vows obedience
And humble service till the point of death.
KING.
Stoop then and set your knee against my foot;
And, in reguerdon of that duty done,
I girt thee with the valiant sword of York:
Rise, Richard, like a true Plantagenet,
And rise created princely Duke of York.
PLANTAGENET.
And so thrive Richard as thy foes may fall!
And as my duty springs, so perish they
That grudge one thought against your majesty!
ALL.
Welcome, high prince, the mighty Duke of York!
SOMERSET.
[Aside] Perish, base prince, ignoble Duke of York!
GLOUCESTER.
Now will it best avail your majesty
To cross the seas and to be crown'd in France:
The presence of a king engenders love
Amongst his subjects and his loyal friends,
As it disanimates his enemies.
KING.
When Gloucester says the word, King Henry goes;
For friendly counsel cuts off many foes.
GLOUCESTER.
Your ships already are in readiness.
[Sennet. Flourish. Exeunt all but Exeter.]
EXETER.
Aye, we may march in England or in France,
Not seeing what is likely to ensue.
This late dissension grown betwixt the peers
Burns under feigned ashes of forged love,
And will at last break out into a flame;
As fest'red members rot but by degree,
Till bones and flesh and sinews fall away,
So will this base and envious discord breed.
And now I fear that fatal prophecy
Which in the time of Henry named the fifth
Was in the mouth of every sucking babe;
That Henry born at Monmouth should win all
And Henry born at Windsor lose all:
Which is so plain, that Exeter doth wish
His days may finish ere that hapless time.
[Exit.]
SCENE II. France. Before Rouen.
[Enter La Pucelle disguised, with four Soldiers
with sacks upon their backs.]
PUCELLE.
These are the city gates, the gates of Rouen,
Through which our policy must make a breach:
Take heed, be wary how you place your words;
Talk like the vulgar sort of market men
That come to gather money for their corn.
If we have entrance, as I hope we shall,
And that we find the slothful watch but weak,
I 'll by a sign give notice to our friends,
That Charles the Dauphin may encounter them.
FIRST SOLDIER.
Our sacks shall be a mean to sack the city,
And we be lords and rulers over Rouen;
Therefore we 'll knock. [Knocks.]
WATCH.
[Within] Qui est la?
PUCELLE.
Paysans, pauvres gens de France;
Poor market folks that come to sell their corn.
WATCH.
Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.
PUCELLE.
Now, Rouen, I 'll shake thy bulwarks to the ground.
[Exeunt.]
[Enter Charles, the Bastard of Orleans, Alencon,
Reignier, and forces.]
CHARLES.
Saint Denis bless this happy stratagem!
And once again we 'll sleep secure in Rouen.
BASTARD.
Here enter'd Pucelle and her practisants;
Now she is there, how will she specify
Here is the best and safest passage in?
REIGNIER.
By thrusting out a torch from yonder tower;
Which, once discern'd, shows that her meaning is,
No way to that, for weakness, which she enter'd.
