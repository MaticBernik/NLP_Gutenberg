_Duke._ Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care;
Which to requite, command me while I live.
This love of theirs myself have often seen,
Haply when they have judged me fast asleep;                         25
And oftentimes have purposed to forbid
Sir Valentine her company and my court:
But, fearing lest my jealous aim might err,
And so, unworthily disgrace the man,
A rashness that I ever yet have shunn'd,                            30
I gave him gentle looks; thereby to find
That which thyself hast now disclosed to me.
And, that thou mayst perceive my fear of this,
Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested,
I nightly lodge her in an upper tower,                              35
The key whereof myself have ever kept;
And thence she cannot be convey'd away.
_Pro._ Know, noble lord, they have devised a mean
How he her chamber-window will ascend,
And with a corded ladder fetch her down;                            40
For which the youthful lover now is gone,
And this way comes he with it presently;
Where, if it please you, you may intercept him.
But, good my Lord, do it so cunningly
That my discovery be not aimed at;                                  45
For, love of you, not hate unto my friend,
Hath made me publisher of this pretence.
_Duke._ Upon mine honour, he shall never know
That I had any light from thee of this.
_Pro._ Adieu, my Lord; Sir Valentine is coming.    [_Exit._         50
  _Enter VALENTINE._
_Duke._ Sir Valentine, whither away so fast?
_Val._ Please it your grace, there is a messenger
That stays to bear my letters to my friends,
And I am going to deliver them.
_Duke._ Be they of much import?                                     55
_Val._ The tenour of them doth but signify
My health and happy being at your court.
_Duke._ Nay then, no matter; stay with me awhile;
I am to break with thee of some affairs
That touch me near, wherein thou must be secret.                    60
'Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought
To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter.
_Val._ I know it well, my Lord; and, sure, the match
Were rich and honourable; besides, the gentleman
Is full of virtue, bounty, worth and qualities                      65
Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter:
Cannot your Grace win her to fancy him?
_Duke._ No, trust me; she is peevish, sullen, froward,
Proud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty;
Neither regarding that she is my child,                             70
Nor fearing me as if I were her father:
And, may I say to thee, this pride of hers,
Upon advice, hath drawn my love from her;
And, where I thought the remnant of mine age
Should have been cherish'd by her child-like duty,                  75
I now am full resolved to take a wife,
And turn her out to who will take her in:
Then let her beauty be her wedding-dower;
For me and my possessions she esteems not.
_Val._ What would your Grace have me to do in this?                 80
_Duke._ There is a lady in Verona here
Whom I affect; but she is nice and coy,
And nought esteems my aged eloquence:
Now, therefore, would I have thee to my tutor,--
For long agone I have forgot to court;                              85
Besides, the fashion of the time is changed,--
How and which way I may bestow myself,
To be regarded in her sun-bright eye.
