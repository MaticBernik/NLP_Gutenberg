ANTONY.
Make me not offended
In your distrust.
CAESAR.
I have said.
ANTONY.
You shall not find,
Though you be therein curious, the least cause
For what you seem to fear: so, the gods keep you,
And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends!
We will here part.
CAESAR.
Farewell, my dearest sister, fare thee well:
The elements be kind to thee, and make
Thy spirits all of comfort! Fare thee well.
OCTAVIA.
My noble brother!--
ANTONY.
The April's in her eyes: it is love's spring,
And these the showers to bring it on.--Be cheerful.
OCTAVIA.
Sir, look well to my husband's house; and--
CAESAR.
What,
Octavia?
OCTAVIA.
I'll tell you in your ear.
ANTONY.
Her tongue will not obey her heart, nor can
Her heart inform her tongue,--the swan's down feather,
That stands upon the swell at the full of tide,
And neither way inclines.
ENOBARBUS.
[Aside to AGRIPPA.] Will Caesar weep?
AGRIPPA.
[Aside to ENOBARBUS.] He has a cloud in's face.
ENOBARBUS.
[Aside to AGRIPPA.] He were the worse for that, were he a horse;
So is he, being a man.
AGRIPPA.
[Aside to ENOBARBUS.] Why, Enobarbus,
When Antony found Julius Caesar dead,
He cried almost to roaring; and he wept
When at Philippi he found Brutus slain.
ENOBARBUS.
[Aside to AGRIPPA.] That year, indeed, he was troubled with a
rheum;
What willingly he did confound he wail'd:
Believe't till I weep too.
CAESAR.
No, sweet Octavia,
You shall hear from me still; the time shall not
Out-go my thinking on you.
ANTONY.
Come, sir, come;
I'll wrestle with you in my strength of love:
Look, here I have you; thus I let you go,
And give you to the gods.
CAESAR.
Adieu; be happy!
LEPIDUS.
Let all the number of the stars give light
To thy fair way!
CAESAR.
Farewell, farewell!
[Kisses OCTAVIA.]
ANTONY.
Farewell!
[Trumpets sound within. Exeunt.]
SCENE III. Alexandria. A Room in the Palace.
[Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS.]
CLEOPATRA.
Where is the fellow?
ALEXAS.
Half afear'd to come.
CLEOPATRA.
Go to, go to.
[Enter a Messenger.]
Come hither, sir.
ALEXAS.
Good majesty,
Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you
But when you are well pleas'd.
CLEOPATRA.
That Herod's head
I'll have: but how? when Antony is gone,
Through whom I might command it?--Come thou near.
MESSENGER.
Most gracious majesty,--
CLEOPATRA.
Didst thou behold Octavia?
MESSENGER.
Ay, dread queen.
CLEOPATRA.
Where?
MESSENGER.
Madam, in Rome
I look'd her in the face, and saw her led
Between her brother and Mark Antony.
CLEOPATRA.
Is she as tall as me?
MESSENGER.
She is not, madam.
CLEOPATRA.
Didst hear her speak? is she shrill-tongu'd or low?
MESSENGER.
Madam, I heard her speak:  she is low-voic'd.
CLEOPATRA.
That's not so good:--he cannot like her long.
CHARMIAN.
Like her! O Isis! 'tis impossible.
CLEOPATRA.
I think so, Charmian: dull of tongue and dwarfish!--
What majesty is in her gait? Remember,
If e'er thou look'dst on majesty.
MESSENGER.
She creeps,--
Her motion and her station are as one;
She shows a body rather than a life,
A statue than a breather.
