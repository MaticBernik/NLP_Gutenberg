SCENE I.
[Enter Pericles, on shipboard.]
PERICLES.
Thou god of this great vast, rebuke these surges,
Which wash forth both heaven and hell; and thou that hast
Upon the winds command, bind them in brass,
Having call'd them from the deep! O, still
Thy deafening, dreadful thunders; gently quench
Thy nimble, sulphurous flashes! O, how, Lychorida,
How does my queen? Thou stormest venomously;
Wilt thou spit all thyself?  The seaman's whistle
Is as a whisper in the ears of death,
Unheard.  Lychorida! - Lucina, O
Divinest patroness, and midwife gentle
To those that cry by night, convey thy deity
Aboard our dancing boat; make swift the pangs
Of my queen's travails!
[Enter Lychorida, with an Infant.]
Now, Lychorida!
LYCHORIDA.
Here is a thing too young for such a place,
Who, if it had conceit, would die, as I
Am like to do: take in your aims this piece
Of your dead queen.
PERICLES.
How, how, Lychorida!
LYCHORIDA.
Patience, good sir; do not assist the storm.
Here's all that is left living of your queen,
A little daughter: for the sake of it,
Be manly, and take comfort.
PERICLES.
O you gods!
Why do you make us love your goodly gifts,
And snatch them straight away? We here below
Recall not what we give, and therein may
Use honour with you.
LYCHORIDA.
Patience, good sir.
Even for this charge.
PERICLES.
Now, mild may be thy life!
For a more blustrous birth had never babe:
Quiet and gentle thy conditions! for
Thou art the rudliest welcome to this world
That ever was prince's child.  Happy what follows!
Thiou hast as chiding a nativity
As fire, air, water, earth, and heaven can make,
To herald thee from the womb: even at the first
Thy loss is more than can thy portage quit,
With all thou canst find here,  Now, the good gods
Throw their best eyes upon't!
{Enter two Sailors.]
FIRST SAILOR.
What courage, sir?  God save you!
PERICLES.
Courage enough: I do not fear the flaw;
It hath done to me the worst.  Yet, for the love
Of ths poor infant, this fresh-new sea-farer,
I would it would be quiet.
FIRST SAILOR.
Slack the bolins there!  Thou wilt not, wilt thou?  Blow, and
split thyself.
SECOND SAILOR.
But sea-room, an the brine and cloudy billow kiss the moon, I
care not.
FIRST SAILOR.
Sir, your queen must overboard: the sea works high, the wind is
loud and will not lie till the ship be cleared of the dead.
PERICLES.
That's your superstition.
FIRST SAILOR.
Pardon us, sir; with us at sea it has been still observed; and we
are strong in custom.  Therefore briefly yield her; for she must
overboard straight.
PERICLES.
As you think meet.  Most wretched queen!
LYCHORIDA.
Here she lies, sir.
PERICLES.
A terrible childben hast thou had, my dear;
No light, no fire: the unfriendly elements
Forgot thee utterly; nor have I time
To give thee hallow'd to thy grave, but straight
Must cast thee, scarcely coffin'd, in the ooze;
Where, for a monument upon thy bones,
And e'er-remaining lamps, the belching whale
And humming water must o'erwhelm thy corpse,
Lying with simple shells.  O Lychorida.
Bid Nestor bring me spices, ink and paper,
My casket and my jewels; and bid Nicander
Bring me the satin coffer: lay the babe
Upon the pillow: hie thee, whiles I say
A priestly farewell to her: suddenly, woman.
