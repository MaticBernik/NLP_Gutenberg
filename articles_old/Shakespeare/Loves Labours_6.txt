PRINCESS.
We arrest your word.
Boyet, you can produce acquittances
For such a sum from special officers
Of Charles his father.
KING.
Satisfy me so.
BOYET.
So please your Grace, the packet is not come,
Where that and other specialties are bound:
To-morrow you shall have a sight of them.
KING.
It shall suffice me; at which interview
All liberal reason I will yield unto.
Meantime receive such welcome at my hand
As honour, without breach of honour, may
Make tender of to thy true worthiness.
You may not come, fair Princess, in my gates;
But here without you shall be so receiv'd
As you shall deem yourself lodg'd in my heart,
Though so denied fair harbour in my house.
Your own good thoughts excuse me, and farewell:
To-morrow shall we visit you again.
PRINCESS.
Sweet health and fair desires consort your Grace!
KING.
Thy own wish wish I thee in every place.
[Exeunt KING and his Train.]
BEROWNE.
Lady, I will commend you to mine own heart.
ROSALINE.
Pray you, do my commendations; I would be glad to see it.
BEROWNE.
I would you heard it groan.
ROSALINE.
Is the fool sick?
BEROWNE.
Sick at the heart.
ROSALINE.
Alack! let it blood.
BEROWNE.
Would that do it good?
ROSALINE.
My physic says 'ay.'
BEROWNE.
Will you prick't with your eye?
ROSALINE.
No point, with my knife.
BEROWNE.
Now, God save thy life!
ROSALINE.
And yours from long living!
BEROWNE.
I cannot stay thanksgiving.
[Retiring.]
DUMAINE.
Sir, I pray you, a word: what lady is that same?
BOYET.
The heir of Alencon, Katharine her name.
DUMAINE.
A gallant lady! Monsieur, fare you well.
[Exit.]
LONGAVILLE.
I beseech you a word: what is she in the white?
BOYET.
A woman sometimes, an you saw her in the light.
LONGAVILLE.
Perchance light in the light. I desire her name.
BOYET.
She hath but one for herself; to desire that were a shame.
LONGAVILLE.
Pray you, sir, whose daughter?
BOYET.
Her mother's, I have heard.
LONGAVILLE.
God's blessing on your beard!
BOYET.
Good sir, be not offended.
She is an heir of Falconbridge.
LONGAVILLE.
Nay, my choler is ended.
She is a most sweet lady.
BOYET.
Not unlike, sir; that may be.
[Exit LONGAVILLE.]
BEROWNE.
What's her name in the cap?
BOYET.
Rosaline, by good hap.
BEROWNE.
Is she wedded or no?
BOYET.
To her will, sir, or so.
BEROWNE.
You are welcome, sir. Adieu!
BOYET.
Farewell to me, sir, and welcome to you.
[Exit BEROWNE.--LADIES unmask.]
MARIA.
That last is Berowne, the merry mad-cap lord;
Not a word with him but a jest.
BOYET.
And every jest but a word.
PRINCESS.
It was well done of you to take him at his word.
BOYET.
I was as willing to grapple as he was to board.
MARIA.
Two hot sheeps, marry!
BOYET.
And wherefore not ships?
No sheep, sweet lamb, unless we feed on your lips.
MARIA.
You sheep and I pasture: shall that finish the jest?
BOYET.
So you grant pasture for me.
