    _Enter MONTJOY,[22] L.H., and kneels C. to the KING._
  _Mont._ Ambassadors from Henry King of England
  Do crave admittance to your majesty.
  _Fr. King._ We'll give them present audience.
    (_MONTJOY rises from his knee._)
                                              Go, and bring them.
    [_Exeunt MONTJOY, and certain LORDS, L.H._
  You see this chase is hotly follow'd, friends.
  _Dau._ Turn head, and stop pursuit; for coward dogs
  Most spend their mouths,[23] when what they seem to threaten
  Runs far before them. Good my sovereign,
  Take up the English short; and let them know
  Of what a monarchy you are the head:
  Self-love, my liege, is not so vile a sin
  As self-neglecting.
    [_FRENCH KING takes his seat on Throne, R._
    _Re-enter MONTJOY, LORDS, with EXETER and Train, L.H._
  _Fr. King._       From our brother England?
  _Exe._ (L.C.) From him; and thus he greets your majesty.
  He wills you, in the awful name of Heaven,
  That you divest yourself, and lay apart
  The borrow'd glories, that, by gift of heaven,
  By law of nature and of nations, 'long
  To him and to his heirs; namely, the crown,
  And all wide-stretched honours that pertain,
  By custom and the ordinance of times
  Unto the crown of France. That you may know
  'Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim,
  Pick'd from the worm-holes of long-vanish'd days,
  Nor from the dust of old oblivion rak'd,
  He sends you this most memorable line,[24]
    [_Gives a paper to MONTJOY, who delivers it kneeling to the KING._
  In every branch truly demonstrative;
  Willing you overlook this pedigree:
  And when you find him evenly deriv'd
  From his most fam'd of famous ancestors,
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  Your crown and kingdom, indirectly held
  From him the native and true challenger.
  _Fr. King._ Or else what follows?
  _Exe._ Bloody constraint; for if you hide the crown
  Even in your hearts, there will he rake for it:
  Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming,
  In thunder and in earthquake, like a Jove.
  (That, if requiring fail, he will compel):
  This is his claim, his threat'ning, and my message;
  Unless the Dauphin be in presence here,
  To whom expressly I bring greeting too.
  _Fr. King._ For us, we will consider of this further:
  To-morrow shall you bear our full intent
  Back to our brother England.
    [_MONTJOY rises, and retires to R._
  _Dau._ (_R. of throne._)   For the Dauphin,
  I stand here for him: What to him from England?
  _Exe._ Scorn and defiance; slight regard, contempt,
  And any thing that may not misbecome
  The mighty sender, doth he prize you at.
  Thus says my king: an if your father's highness
  Do not, in grant of all demands at large,
  Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his majesty,
  He'll call you to so hot an answer for it,
  That caves and womby vaultages of France
  Shall chide your trespass,[25] and return your mock
  In second accent of his ordnance.
  _Dau._ Say, if my father render fair reply,
  It is against my will; for I desire
  Nothing but odds with England: to that end,
  As matching to his youth and vanity,
  I did present him with those Paris balls.
