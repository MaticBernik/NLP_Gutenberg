_Sal_. 'Tis vile, unless it may be quaintly order'd;
And better, in my mind, not undertook.
_Lor_. 'Tis now but four o'clock; we have two hours
To furnish us.--
_Enter_ LAUNCELOT _with a letter_.
Friend Launcelot, what's the news?
_Lau_. An it shall please you to break up this,[62] it shall seem to
signify.
_Lor_. I know the hand: in faith, 'tis a fair hand;
And whiter than the paper it writ on
Is the fair hand that writ.
_Gra_. Love-news, in faith.
_Lau_. By your leave, sir.
_Lor_. Whither goest thou?
_Lau_. Marry, sir, to bid my old master the Jew to sup to-night with my
new master the Christian.
_Lor_. Hold here, take this:--tell gentle Jessica, I will not fail
her;--speak it privately; go.
[_Exit_ LAUNCELOT _into house_.
Gentlemen,
Will you prepare you for this masque to-night?
I am provided of a torch-bearer.
_Salar_. Ay, marry, I'll be gone about it straight.
_Sal_. And so will I.
_Lor_. Meet me and Gratiano
At Gratiano's lodging some hour hence.
_Salar_. 'Tis good we do so.
[_Exeunt_ SALARINO _and_ SALANIO.
_Gra_. Was not that letter from fair Jessica?
_Lor_. I must needs tell thee all: She hath directed
How I shall take her from her father's house;
What gold and jewels she is furnish'd with;
Come, go with me; peruse this as thou goest:
Fair Jessica shall be my torch-bearer.
[_Exeunt_.
_Enter_ SHYLOCK _and_ LAUNCELOT _from House_.
_Shy_. Well, thou shalt see, thy eyes shall be thy judge,
The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio:
What, Jessica!--thou shalt not gormandize,
As thou hast done with me;--What, Jessica!--
And sleep and snore, and rend apparel out;--
Why, Jessica, I say!
_Lau_. Why, Jessica!
_Shy_. Who bids thee call? I do not bid thee call.
_Lau_. Your worship was wont to tell me I could do nothing without
bidding.
_Enter_ JESSICA.
_Jes_. Call you? What is your will?
_Shy_. I am bid forth to supper,[63] Jessica;
There are my keys:--But wherefore should I go?
I am not bid for love: they flatter me:
But yet I'll go in hate, to feed upon
The prodigal Christian:[64]--Jessica, my girl,
Look to my house:--I am right loath to go;
There is some ill a brewing towards my rest,
For I did dream of money-bags to night.
_Lau_. I beseech you, sir, go; my young master doth expect your
reproach.
_Shy_. So do I his.
_Lau_. And they have conspired together,--I will not say, you shall see
a masque; but if you do, then it was not for nothing that my nose fell a
bleeding[65] on Black Monday(B) last, at six o'clock i'the morning,
falling out that year on Ash-Wednesday was four year in the afternoon.
_Shy_. What! are there masques? Hear you me, Jessica:
Lock up my doors; and when you hear the drum,
And the vile squeaking of the wry-neck'd fife,[66]
Clamber not you up to the casements then,
Nor thrust your head into the public street,
To gaze on Christian fools with varnish'd faces:
But stop my house's ears, I mean my casements;
Let not the sound of shallow foppery enter
My sober house.--By Jacob's staff I swear,
I have no mind of feasting forth to-night:
But I will go.--Go you before me, sirrah;
Say, I will come.
