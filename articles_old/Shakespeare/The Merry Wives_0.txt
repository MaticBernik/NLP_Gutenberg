  _Enter ANNE PAGE, with wine; MISTRESS FORD and MISTRESS PAGE,
  following._
_Page._ Nay, daughter, carry the wine in; we'll drink              170
within.    [_Exit Anne Page._
_Slen._ O heaven! this is Mistress Anne Page.
_Page._ How now, Mistress Ford!
_Fal._ Mistress Ford, by my troth, you are very well
met: by your leave, good mistress.    [_Kisses her._               175
_Page._ Wife, bid these gentlemen welcome. Come, we
have a hot venison pasty to dinner: come, gentlemen, I
hope we shall drink down all unkindness.
    [_Exeunt all except Shal., Slen., and Evans._
_Slen._ I had rather than forty shillings I had my Book
of Songs and Sonnets here.                                         180
  _Enter SIMPLE._
How now, Simple! where have you been? I must wait on
myself, must I? You have not the Book of Riddles about
you, have you?
_Sim._ Book of Riddles! why, did you not lend it to
Alice Shortcake upon All-hallowmas last, a fortnight afore         185
Michaelmas?
_Shal._ Come, coz; come, coz; we stay for you. A word
with you, coz; marry, this, coz: there is, as 'twere, a tender,
a kind of tender, made afar off by Sir Hugh here. Do
you understand me?                                                 190
_Slen._ Ay, sir, you shall find me reasonable; if it be so,
I shall do that that is reason.
_Shal._ Nay, but understand me.
_Slen._ So I do, sir.
_Evans._ Give ear to his motions, Master Slender: I will           195
description the matter to you, if you be capacity of it.
_Slen._ Nay, I will do as my cousin Shallow says: I
pray you, pardon me; he's a justice of peace in his country,
simple though I stand here.
_Evans._ But that is not the question: the question is             200
concerning your marriage.
_Shal._ Ay, there's the point, sir.
_Evans._ Marry, is it; the very point of it; to Mistress
Anne Page.
_Slen._ Why, if it be so, I will marry her upon any reasonable     205
demands.
_Evans._ But can you affection the 'oman? Let us command
to know that of your mouth or of your lips; for divers
philosophers hold that the lips is parcel of the mouth.
Therefore, precisely, can you carry your good will to the          210
maid?
_Shal._ Cousin Abraham Slender, can you love her?
_Slen._ I hope, sir, I will do as it shall become one that
would do reason.
_Evans._ Nay, Got's lords and his ladies! you must                 215
speak possitable, if you can carry her your desires towards
her.
_Shal._ That you must. Will you, upon good dowry,
marry her?
_Slen._ I will do a greater thing than that, upon your             220
request, cousin, in any reason.
_Shal._ Nay, conceive me, conceive me, sweet coz: what
I do is to pleasure you, coz. Can you love the maid?
_Slen._ I will marry her, sir, at your request: but if there
be no great love in the beginning, yet heaven may decrease         225
it upon better acquaintance, when we are married and have
more occasion to know one another; I hope, upon familiarity
will grow more contempt: but if you say, 'Marry her,'
I will marry her; that I am freely dissolved, and dissolutely.
