MOTH.
  Until the goose came out of door,
  And stay'd the odds by adding four.
Now will I begin your moral, and do you follow with my l'envoy.
  The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
  Were still at odds, being but three.
ARMADO.
  Until the goose came out of door,
  Staying the odds by adding four.
MOTH.
A good l'envoy, ending in the goose; would you desire more?
COSTARD.
The boy hath sold him a bargain, a goose, that's flat.
Sir, your pennyworth is good an your goose be fat.
To sell a bargain well is as cunning as fast and loose:
Let me see: a fat l'envoy; ay, that's a fat goose.
ARMADO.
Come hither, come hither. How did this argument begin?
MOTH.
By saying that a costard was broken in a shin.
Then call'd you for the l'envoy.
COSTARD.
True, and I for a plantain: thus came your argument in;
Then the boy's fat l'envoy, the goose that you bought;
And he ended the market.
ARMADO.
But tell me; how was there a costard broken in a shin?
MOTH.
I will tell you sensibly.
COSTARD.
Thou hast no feeling of it, Moth: I will speak that
l'envoy:
  I, Costard, running out, that was safely within,
  Fell over the threshold and broke my shin.
ARMADO.
We will talk no more of this matter.
COSTARD.
Till there be more matter in the shin.
ARMADO.
Sirrah Costard. I will enfranchise thee.
COSTARD.
O! marry me to one Frances: I smell some l'envoy, some
goose, in this.
ARMADO.
By my sweet soul, I mean setting thee at liberty,
enfreedoming thy person: thou wert immured, restrained,
captivated, bound.
COSTARD.
True, true; and now you will be my purgation, and let me
loose.
ARMADO.
I give thee thy liberty, set thee from durance; and, in
lieu thereof, impose on thee nothing but this:--[Giving a
letter.] Bear this significant to the country maid Jaquenetta.
[Giving money.] there is remuneration; for the best ward of mine
honour is rewarding my dependents. Moth, follow.
[Exit.]
MOTH.
Like the sequel, I. Signior Costard, adieu.
COSTARD.
My sweet ounce of man's flesh! my incony Jew!
[Exit MOTH.]
Now will I look to his remuneration. Remuneration! O! that's the
Latin word for three farthings: three farthings, remuneration.
'What's the price of this inkle?' 'One penny.' 'No, I'll give
you a remuneration.' Why, it carries it. Remuneration! Why, it is
a fairer name than French crown. I will never buy and sell out of
this word.
[Enter BEROWNE.]
BEROWNE.
O! My good knave Costard, exceedingly well met.
COSTARD.
Pray you, sir, how much carnation riband may a man buy for
a remuneration?
BEROWNE.
What is a remuneration?
COSTARD.
Marry, sir, halfpenny farthing.
BEROWNE.
Why, then, three-farthing worth of silk.
COSTARD.
I thank your worship. God be wi' you!
BEROWNE.
Stay, slave; I must employ thee:
As thou wilt win my favour, good my knave,
Do one thing for me that I shall entreat.
COSTARD.
When would you have it done, sir?
