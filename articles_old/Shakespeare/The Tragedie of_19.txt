_Hor._ No, by no meanes.
_Ham_. It will not speake: then will I follow it.
                                                      [Sidenote: I will]
_Hor._ Doe not my Lord.
_Ham._ Why, what should be the feare?
I doe not set my life at a pins fee;
And for my Soule, what can it doe to that?
Being a thing immortall as it selfe:[10]
It waues me forth againe; Ile follow it.
_Hor._ What if it tempt you toward the Floud my Lord?[11]
[Footnote 1: --that of his father, so moving him to question it.
_Questionable_ does not mean _doubtful_, but _fit to be questioned_.]
[Footnote 2: 'I'll _call_ thee'--for the nonce.]
[Footnote 3: I think _hearse_ was originally the bier--French _herse_, a
harrow--but came to be applied to the coffin: _hearsed_ in
death--_coffined_ in death.]
[Footnote 4: There is no impropriety in the use of the word _inurned_.
It is a figure--a word once-removed in its application: the sepulchre is
the urn, the body the ashes. _Interred_ Shakspere had concluded
incorrect, for the body was not laid in the earth.]
[Footnote 5: So in _1st Q_.]
[Footnote 6: 'fooles of Nature'--fools in the presence of her
knowledge--to us no knowledge--of her action, to us inexplicable. _A
fact_ that looks unreasonable makes one feel like a fool. See Psalm
lxxiii. 22: 'So foolish was I and ignorant, I was as a beast before
thee.' As some men are our fools, we are all Nature's fools; we are so
far from knowing anything as it is.]
[Footnote 7: Even if Shakspere cared more about grammar than he does, a
man in Hamlet's perturbation he might well present as making a breach in
it; but we are not reduced even to justification. _Toschaken_ (_to_ as
German _zu_ intensive) is a recognized English word; it means _to shake
to pieces_. The construction of the passage is, 'What may this mean,
that thou revisitest thus the glimpses of the moon, and that we so
horridly to-shake our disposition?' So in _The Merry Wives_,
    And fairy-like to-pinch the unclean knight.
'our disposition': our _cosmic structure_.]
[Footnote 8: 'with thoughts that are too much for them, and as an
earthquake to them.']
[Footnote 9: Like all true souls, Hamlet wants to know what he is _to
do_. He looks out for the action required of him.]
[Footnote 10: Note here Hamlet's mood--dominated by his faith. His life
in this world his mother has ruined; he does not care for it a pin: he
is not the less confident of a nature that is immortal. In virtue of
this belief in life, he is indifferent to the form of it. When, later in
the play, he seems to fear death, it is death the consequence of an
action of whose rightness he is not convinced.]
[Footnote 11: _The Quarto has dropped out_ 'Lord.']
