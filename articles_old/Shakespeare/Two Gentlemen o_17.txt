_Val._ Win her with gifts, if she respect not words:
Dumb jewels often in their silent kind                              90
More than quick words do move a woman's mind.
_Duke._ But she did scorn a present that I sent her.
_Val._ A woman sometimes scorns what best contents her.
Send her another; never give her o'er;
For scorn at first makes afterlove the more.                        95
If she do frown, 'tis not in hate of you,
But rather to beget more love in you:
If she do chide, 'tis not to have you gone;
For why, the fools are mad, if left alone.
Take no repulse, whatever she doth say;                            100
For 'get you gone,' she doth not mean 'away!'
Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces;
Though ne'er so black, say they have angels' faces.
That man that hath a tongue, I say, is no man,
If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.                          105
_Duke._ But she I mean is promised by her friends
Unto a youthful gentleman of worth;
And kept severely from resort of men,
That no man hath access by day to her.
_Val._ Why, then, I would resort to her by night.                  110
_Duke._ Ay, but the doors be lock'd, and keys kept safe,
That no man hath recourse to her by night.
_Val._ What lets but one may enter at her window?
_Duke._ Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,
And built so shelving, that one cannot climb it                    115
Without apparent hazard of his life.
_Val._ Why, then, a ladder, quaintly made of cords,
To cast up, with a pair of anchoring hooks,
Would serve to scale another Hero's tower,
So bold Leander would adventure it.                                120
_Duke._ Now, as thou art a gentleman of blood,
Advise me where I may have such a ladder.
_Val._ When would you use it? pray, sir, tell me that.
_Duke._ This very night; for Love is like a child,
That longs for every thing that he can come by.                    125
_Val._ By seven o'clock I'll get you such a ladder.
_Duke._ But, hark thee; I will go to her alone:
How shall I best convey the ladder thither?
_Val._ It will be light, my lord, that you may bear it
Under a cloak that is of any length.                               130
_Duke._ A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?
_Val._ Ay, my good lord.
_Duke._                Then let me see thy cloak:
I'll get me one of such another length.
_Val._ Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord.
_Duke._ How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?                    135
I pray thee, let me feel thy cloak upon me.
What letter is this same? What's here? 'To Silvia'!
And here an engine fit for my proceeding.
I'll be so bold to break the seal for once.    [_Reads._
    'My thoughts do harbour with my Silvia nightly;                140
      And slaves they are to me, that send them flying:
    O, could their master come and go as lightly,
      Himself would lodge where senseless they are lying!
    My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them;
      While I, their king, that thither them importune,            145
    Do curse the grace that with such grace hath bless'd them,
      Because myself do want my servants' fortune:
    I curse myself, for they are sent by me,
    That they should harbour where their lord would be.
