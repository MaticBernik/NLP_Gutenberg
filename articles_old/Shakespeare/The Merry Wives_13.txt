_Fal._ Sayest thou so, old Jack? go thy ways; I'll make
more of thy old body than I have done. Will they yet
look after thee? Wilt thou, after the expense of so much
money, be now a gainer? Good body, I thank thee. Let
them say 'tis grossly done; so it be fairly done, no matter.       130
  _Enter BARDOLPH._
_Bard._ Sir John, there's one Master Brook below would
fain speak with you, and be acquainted with you; and hath
sent your worship a morning's draught of sack.
_Fal._ Brook is his name?
_Bard._ Ay, sir.                                                   135
_Fal._ Call him in. [_Exit Bardolph._] Such Brooks are
welcome to me, that o'erflow such liquor. Ah, ha! Mistress
Ford and Mistress Page have I encompassed you? go to; via!
_Re-enter BARDOLPH, with FORD disguised._
_Ford._ Bless you, sir!
_Fal._ And you, sir! Would you speak with me?                      140
_Ford._ I make bold to press with so little preparation
upon you.
_Fal._ You're welcome. What's your will?--Give us
leave, drawer.    [_Exit Bardolph._
_Ford._ Sir, I am a gentleman that have spent much;                145
my name is Brook.
_Fal._ Good Master Brook, I desire more acquaintance
of you.
_Ford._ Good Sir John, I sue for yours: not to charge
you; for I must let you understand I think myself in better        150
plight for a lender than you are: the which hath something
emboldened me to this unseasoned intrusion; for they say,
if money go before, all ways do lie open.
_Fal._ Money is a good soldier, sir, and will on.
_Ford._ Troth, and I have a bag of money here troubles             155
me: if you will help to bear it, Sir John, take all, or half, for
easing me of the carriage.
_Fal._ Sir, I know not how I may deserve to be your
porter.
_Ford._ I will tell you, sir, if you will give me the hearing.     160
_Fal._ Speak, good Master Brook: I shall be glad to be
your servant.
_Ford._ Sir, I hear you are a scholar,--I will be brief with
you,--and you have been a man long known to me, though
I had never so good means, as desire, to make myself acquainted    165
with you. I shall discover a thing to you, wherein
I must very much lay open mine own imperfection: but,
good Sir John, as you have one eye upon my follies, as you
hear them unfolded, turn another into the register of your
own; that I may pass with a reproof the easier, sith you           170
yourself know how easy it is to be such an offender.
_Fal._ Very well, sir; proceed.
_Ford._ There is a gentlewoman in this town; her husband's
name is Ford.
_Fal._ Well, sir.                                                  175
_Ford._ I have long loved her, and, I protest to you, bestowed
much on her; followed her with a doting observance;
engrossed opportunities to meet her; fee'd every slight occasion
that could but niggardly give me sight of her; not only
bought many presents to give her, but have given largely to        180
many to know what she would have given; briefly, I have
pursued her as love hath pursued me; which hath been on
the wing of all occasions. But whatsoever I have merited,
either in my mind or in my means, meed, I am sure, I have
received none; unless experience be a jewel that I have            185
purchased at an infinite rate, and that hath taught me to
say this:
  'Love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues;
  Pursuing that that flies, and flying what pursues.'
