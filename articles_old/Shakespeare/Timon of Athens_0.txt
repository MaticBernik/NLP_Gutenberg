   Tim. That's a deed thou't dye for
   Ape. Right, if doing nothing be death by th' Law
   Tim. How lik'st thou this picture Apemantus?
  Ape. The best, for the innocence
   Tim. Wrought he not well that painted it
   Ape. He wrought better that made the Painter, and
yet he's but a filthy peece of worke
   Pain. Y'are a Dogge
   Ape. Thy Mothers of my generation: what's she, if I
be a Dogge?
  Tim. Wilt dine with me Apemantus?
  Ape. No: I eate not Lords
   Tim. And thou should'st, thoud'st anger Ladies
   Ape. O they eate Lords;
So they come by great bellies
   Tim. That's a lasciuious apprehension
   Ape. So, thou apprehend'st it,
Take it for thy labour
   Tim. How dost thou like this Iewell, Apemantus?
  Ape. Not so well as plain-dealing, which wil not cast
a man a Doit
   Tim. What dost thou thinke 'tis worth?
  Ape. Not worth my thinking.
How now Poet?
  Poet. How now Philosopher?
  Ape. Thou lyest
   Poet. Art not one?
  Ape. Yes
   Poet. Then I lye not
   Ape. Art not a Poet?
  Poet. Yes
   Ape. Then thou lyest:
Looke in thy last worke, where thou hast feign'd him a
worthy Fellow
   Poet. That's not feign'd, he is so
   Ape. Yes he is worthy of thee, and to pay thee for thy
labour. He that loues to be flattered, is worthy o'th flatterer.
Heauens, that I were a Lord
   Tim. What wouldst do then Apemantus?
  Ape. E'ne as Apemantus does now, hate a Lord with
my heart
   Tim. What thy selfe?
  Ape. I
   Tim. Wherefore?
  Ape. That I had no angry wit to be a Lord.
Art not thou a Merchant?
  Mer. I Apemantus
   Ape. Traffick confound thee, if the Gods will not
   Mer. If Trafficke do it, the Gods do it
   Ape. Traffickes thy God, & thy God confound thee.
Trumpet sounds. Enter a Messenger.
  Tim. What Trumpets that?
  Mes. 'Tis Alcibiades, and some twenty Horse
All of Companionship
   Tim. Pray entertaine them, giue them guide to vs.
You must needs dine with me: go not you hence
Till I haue thankt you: when dinners done
Shew me this peece, I am ioyfull of your sights.
Enter Alcibiades with the rest.
Most welcome Sir
   Ape. So, so; their Aches contract, and sterue your
supple ioynts: that there should bee small loue amongest
these sweet Knaues, and all this Curtesie. The straine of
mans bred out into Baboon and Monkey
   Alc. Sir, you haue sau'd my longing, and I feed
Most hungerly on your sight
   Tim. Right welcome Sir:
Ere we depart, wee'l share a bounteous time
In different pleasures.
Pray you let vs in.
Exeunt.
Enter two Lords.
  1.Lord What time a day is't Apemantus?
  Ape. Time to be honest
   1 That time serues still
   Ape. The most accursed thou that still omitst it
   2 Thou art going to Lord Timons Feast
   Ape. I, to see meate fill Knaues, and Wine heat fooles
   2 Farthee well, farthee well
   Ape. Thou art a Foole to bid me farewell twice
