_Bas_. Be assured you may.
_Shy_. I will be assured I may; and that I may be assured I will bethink
me: May I speak with Antonio?
_Bas_. If it please you to dine with us.
_Shy_. Yes, to smell pork; to eat of the habitation which your prophet,
the Nazarite, conjured the devil into![23] I will buy with you, sell
with you, talk with you, walk with you, and so following; but I will not
eat with you, drink with you, nor pray with you.--What news on the
Rialto?--Who is he comes here?
_Bas_. This is signior Antonio.
[Exit_ BASSANIO.
_Shy. (aside.)_ How like a fawning publican he looks!
I hate him, for he is a Christian:
But more, for that, in low simplicity,
He lends out money gratis, and brings down
The rate of usance here with us in Venice. (E)
If I can catch him once upon the hip,[24]
I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.
He hates our sacred nation: and he rails
Even there where merchants most do congregate,
On me, my bargains, and my well-won thrift.
Which he calls interest: Cursed be my tribe
If I forgive him!
_Re-enter_ BASSANIO _with_ ANTONIO.
_Bas_. Shylock, do you hear?
_Shy_. I am debating of my present store;
And, by the near guess of my memory,
I cannot instantly raise up the gross
Of full three thousand ducats: What of that?
Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,
Will furnish me: But soft: How many months
Do you desire?--Rest you fair, good signior:
[To ANTONIO.
Your worship was the last man in our mouths.
_Ant_. Shylock, albeit, I neither lend nor borrow,
By taking, nor by giving of excess.
Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,[25]
I'll break a custom:---Is he yet possess'd[26]
How much you would?
_Shy_. Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.
_Ant_. And for three months.
_Shy_. I had forgot,--three months, you told me so.
Well then, your bond; and, let me see. But hear you:
Methought you said, you neither lend nor borrow,
Upon advantage.
_Ant_. I do never use it.
_Shy_. When Jacob graz'd his uncle Laban's sheep,
This Jacob from our holy Abraham was
(As his wise mother wrought in his behalf)
The third possessor; ay, he was the third.
_Ant_. And what of him? did he take interest?
_Shy_. No, not take interest; not, as you would say,
Directly interest: mark what Jacob did.
When Laban and himself were compromis'd
That all the eanlings[27] which were streak'd and pied
Should fall, as Jacob's hire;
The skilful shepherd peel'd me certain wands,[28]
And, in the doing of the deed of kind,[29]
He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes;[30]
Who, then conceiving, did in eaning-time
Fall[31] party-coloured lambs, and those were Jacob's.[32]
This was a way to thrive, and he was blest;
And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not.
_Ant_. This was a venture, Sir, that Jacob serv'd for;
A thing not in his power to bring to pass,
But sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of Heaven.
Was this inserted to make interest good?
Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?
