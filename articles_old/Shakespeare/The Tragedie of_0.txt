_Mar._ Peace, breake thee of: _Enter the Ghost_. [Sidenote: Enter Ghost]
Looke where it comes againe.
_Barn._ In the same figure, like the King that's dead.
[Footnote 1: Better, I think; for the tone is scoffing, and Horatio is
the incredulous one who has not seen it.]
[Footnote 2: --being a scholar, and able to address it as an apparition
ought to be addressed--Marcellus thinking, perhaps, with others, that a
ghost required Latin.]
[Footnote 3: _1st Q._ 'towling one.]
[Page 6]
[Sidenote: 4] _Mar._ Thou art a Scholler; speake to it _Horatio._
_Barn._ Lookes it not like the King? Marke it _Horatio_.
                                                 [Sidenote: Looks a not]
_Hora._ Most like: It harrowes me with fear and wonder.
                                                 [Sidenote: horrowes[1]]
_Barn._ It would be spoke too.[2]
_Mar._ Question it _Horatio._          [Sidenote: Speak to it _Horatio_]
_Hor._ What art thou that vsurp'st this time of night,[3]
Together with that Faire and Warlike forme[4]
In which the Maiesty of buried Denmarke
Did sometimes[5] march: By Heauen I charge thee speake.
_Mar._ It is offended.[6]
_Barn._ See, it stalkes away.
_Hor._ Stay: speake; speake: I Charge thee, speake.
               _Exit the Ghost._               [Sidenote: _Exit Ghost._]
_Mar._ 'Tis gone, and will not answer.
_Barn._ How now _Horatio_? You tremble and look pale:
Is not this something more then Fantasie?
What thinke you on't?
_Hor._ Before my God, I might not this beleeue
Without the sensible and true auouch
Of mine owne eyes.
_Mar._ Is it not like the King?
_Hor._ As thou art to thy selfe,
Such was the very Armour he had on,
When th' Ambitious Norwey combatted: [Sidenote: when he the ambitious]
So frown'd he once, when in an angry parle
He smot the sledded Pollax on the Ice.[8]         [Sidenote: sleaded[7]]
'Tis strange.
[Sidenote: 274] _Mar._ Thus twice before, and iust at this dead houre,
                                            [Sidenote: and jump at this]
[Footnote 1: _1st Q_. 'horrors mee'.]
[Footnote 2: A ghost could not speak, it was believed, until it was
spoken to.]
[Footnote 3: It was intruding upon the realm of the embodied.]
[Footnote 4: None of them took it as certainly the late king: it was
only clear to them that it was like him. Hence they say, 'usurp'st the
forme.']
[Footnote 5: _formerly_.]
[Footnote 6: --at the word _usurp'st_.]
[Footnote 7: Also _1st Q_.]
[Footnote 8: The usual interpretation is 'the sledged Poles'; but not to
mention that in a parley such action would have been treacherous, there
is another far more picturesque, and more befitting the _angry parle_,
at the same time more characteristic and forcible: the king in his anger
smote his loaded pole-axe on the ice. There is some uncertainty about
the word _sledded_ or _sleaded_ (which latter suggests _lead_), but we
have the word _sledge_ and _sledge-hammer_, the smith's heaviest, and
the phrase, 'a sledging blow.' The quarrel on the occasion referred to
rather seems with the Norwegians (See Schmidt's _Shakespeare-Lexicon:
Sledded_.) than with the Poles; and there would be no doubt as to the
latter interpretation being the right one, were it not that _the
Polacke_, for the Pole, or nation of the Poles, does occur in the play.
That is, however, no reason why the Dane should not have carried a
pole-axe, or caught one from the hand of an attendant. In both our
authorities, and in the _1st Q_. also, the word is _pollax_--as in
Chaucer's _Knights Tale_: 'No maner schot, ne pollax, ne schort
knyf,'--in the _Folio_ alone with a capital; whereas not once in the
play is the similar word that stands for the Poles used in the plural.
In the _2nd Quarto_ there is _Pollacke_ three times, _Pollack_ once,
_Pole_ once; in the _1st Quarto_, _Polacke_ twice; in the _Folio_,
_Poleak_ twice, _Polake_ once. The Poet seems to have avoided the plural
form.]
