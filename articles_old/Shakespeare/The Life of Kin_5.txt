BARDOLPH.
Away, you rogue!
HOSTESS.
By my troth, he'll yield the crow a pudding one of these days.
The King has kill'd his heart.
Good husband, come home presently.
[Exeunt Hostess and Boy.]
BARDOLPH.
Come, shall I make you two friends? We must to France
together; why the devil should we keep knives to cut one
another's throats?
PISTOL.
Let floods o'erswell, and fiends for food howl on!
NYM.
You'll pay me the eight shillings I won of you at betting?
PISTOL.
Base is the slave that pays.
NYM.
That now I will have: that's the humour of it.
PISTOL.
As manhood shall compound.  Push home.
[They draw.]
BARDOLPH.
By this sword, he that makes the first thrust, I'll kill
him; by this sword, I will.
PISTOL.
Sword is an oath, and oaths must have their course.
BARDOLPH.
Corporal Nym, and thou wilt be friends, be friends; an
thou wilt not, why, then, be enemies with me too. Prithee,
put up.
NYM.
I shall have my eight shillings I won from you at betting?
PISTOL.
A noble shalt thou have, and present pay;
And liquor likewise will I give to thee,
And friendship shall combine, and brotherhood.
I'll live by Nym, and Nym shall live by me.
Is not this just? For I shall sutler be
Unto the camp, and profits will accrue.
Give me thy hand.
NYM.
I shall have my noble?
PISTOL.
In cash most justly paid.
NYM.
Well, then, that's the humour of't.
[Re-enter Hostess.]
HOSTESS.
As ever you come of women, come in quickly to Sir John.
Ah, poor heart! he is so shak'd of a burning quotidian tertian,
that it is most lamentable to behold. Sweet men, come to him.
NYM.
The King hath run bad humours on the knight; that's the even
of it.
PISTOL.
Nym, thou hast spoke the right.
His heart is fracted and corroborate.
NYM.
The King is a good king; but it must be as it may; he
passes some humours and careers.
PISTOL.
Let us condole the knight; for, lambkins, we will live.
[Exeunt.]
SCENE II. Southampton. A council-chamber.
[Enter Exeter, Bedford, and Westmoreland.]
BEDFORD.
'Fore God, his Grace is bold, to trust these traitors.
EXETER.
They shall be apprehended by and by.
WESTMORELAND.
How smooth and even they do bear themselves!
As if allegiance in their bosoms sat
Crowned with faith and constant loyalty.
BEDFORD.
The King hath note of all that they intend,
By interception which they dream not of.
EXETER.
Nay, but the man that was his bed-fellow,
Whom he hath dull'd and cloy'd with gracious favours,
That he should, for a foreign purse, so sell
His sovereign's life to death and treachery.
[Trumpets sound. Enter King Henry, Scroop, Cambridge,
and Grey.]
KING HENRY.
Now sits the wind fair, and we will aboard.
My Lord of Cambridge, and my kind Lord of Masham,
And you, my gentle knight, give me your thoughts.
Think you not that the powers we bear with us
Will cut their passage through the force of France,
Doing the execution and the act
For which we have in head assembled them?
