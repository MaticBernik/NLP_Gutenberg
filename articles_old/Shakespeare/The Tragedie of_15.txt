_Ophe._ He hath my Lord of late, made many tenders
Of his affection to me.
_Polon._ Affection, puh.  You speake like a greene Girle,
Vnsifted in such perillous Circumstance.
Doe you beleeue his tenders, as you call them?
_Ophe._ I do not know, my Lord, what I should thinke.
_Polon._ Marry Ile teach you; thinke your self a Baby,
                                                      [Sidenote: I will]
That you haue tane his tenders for true pay,      [Sidenote: tane these]
Which are not starling. Tender your selfe more dearly;
                                                    [Sidenote: sterling]
Or not to crack the winde of the poore Phrase,
                                                [Sidenote: (not ... &c.]
Roaming it[3] thus, you'l tender me a foole.[4]
                                               [Sidenote: Wrong it thus]
_Ophe._ My Lord, he hath importun'd me with loue,
In honourable fashion.
_Polon._ I, fashion you may call it, go too, go too.
_Ophe._ And hath giuen countenance to his speech,
My Lord, with all the vowes of Heauen.
                           [Sidenote: with almost all the holy vowes of]
[Footnote 1: There had then been a good deal of intercourse between
Hamlet and Ophelia: she had heartily encouraged him.]
[Footnote 2: 'as so I am informed, and that by way of caution,']
[Footnote 3: --making it, 'the poor phrase' _tenders_, gallop wildly
about--as one might _roam_ a horse; _larking it_.]
[Footnote 4: 'you will in your own person present me a fool.']

_Polon_. I, Springes to catch Woodcocks.[1] I doe know
                                                     [Sidenote: springs]
When the Bloud burnes, how Prodigall the Soule[2]
Giues the tongue vowes: these blazes, Daughter,    [Sidenote: Lends the]
Giuing more light then heate; extinct in both,[3]
Euen in their promise, as it is a making;
You must not take for fire. For this time Daughter,[4]
                                             [Sidenote: fire, from this]
Be somewhat scanter of your Maiden presence;       [Sidenote: something]
Set your entreatments[5] at a higher rate,
Then a command to parley. For Lord _Hamlet_,          [Sidenote: parle;]
Beleeue so much in him, that he is young,
And with a larger tether may he walke,                 [Sidenote: tider]
Then may be giuen you. In few,[6] _Ophelia_,
Doe not beleeue his vowes; for they are Broakers,
Not of the eye,[7] which their Inuestments show:
                                                 [Sidenote: of that die]
But meere implorators of vnholy Sutes,         [Sidenote: imploratators]
Breathing like sanctified and pious bonds,
The better to beguile. This is for all:[8]           [Sidenote: beguide]
I would not, in plaine tearmes, from this time forth,
Haue you so slander any moment leisure,[9]
[Sidenote: 70, 82] As to giue words or talke with the Lord _Hamlet_:[10]
Looke too't, I charge you; come your wayes.
_Ophe_. I shall obey my Lord.[11]     _Exeunt_.
_Enter Hamlet, Horatio, Marcellus._          [Sidenote: _and Marcellus_]
[Sidenote: 2] _Ham_. [12]The Ayre bites shrewdly: is it very cold?[13]
_Hor_. It is a nipping and an eager ayre.
_Ham_. What hower now?
_Hor_. I thinke it lacks of twelue.
_Mar_. No, it is strooke.
_Hor_. Indeed I heard it not: then it drawes neere the season,
                                                     [Sidenote: it then]
Wherein the Spirit held his wont to walke.
What does this meane my Lord? [14]
          [Sidenote: _A flourish of trumpets and 2 peeces goes of._[14]]
