_Lucio._ [_Aside to Isab._] O, to him, to him, wench!
      he will relent;
He's coming; I perceive't.
_Prov._ [_Aside_] Pray heaven she win him!                         125
_Isab._ We cannot weigh our brother with ourself:
Great men may jest with saints; 'tis wit in them.
But in the less foul profanation.
_Lucio._ Thou'rt i' the right, girl; more o' that.
_Isab._ That in the captain's but a choleric word,                 130
Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy.
_Lucio._ [_Aside to Isab._] Art avised o' that? more on't.
_Ang._ Why do you put these sayings upon me?
_Isab._ Because authority, though it err like others.
Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself,                             135
That skins the vice o' the top. Go to your bosom;
Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know
That's like my brother's fault: if it confess
A natural guiltiness such as is his,
Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue                        140
Against my brother's life.
_Ang._ [_Aside_] She speaks, and 'tis
Such sense, that my sense breeds with it. Fare you well.
_Isab._ Gentle my lord, turn back.
_Ang._ I will bethink me: come again to-morrow.
_Isab._ Hark how I'll bribe you: good my lord, turn back.          145
_Ang._ How? bribe me?
_Isab._ Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.
_Lucio._ [_Aside to Isab._] Yon had marr'd all else.
_Isab._ Not with fond shekels of the tested gold,
Or stones whose rates are either rich or poor                      150
As fancy values them; but with true prayers
That shall be up at heaven and enter there
Ere sun-rise, prayers from preserved souls,
From fasting maids whose minds are dedicate
To nothing temporal.
_Ang._             Well; come to me to-morrow.                     155
_Lucio._ [_Aside to Isab._] Go to; 'tis well; away!
_Isab._ Heaven keep your honour safe!
_Ang._ [_Aside_] Amen:
For I am that way going to temptation,
Where prayers cross.
_Isab._            At what hour to-morrow
Shall I attend your lordship?
_Ang._                      At any time 'fore noon.                160
_Isab._ 'Save your honour!
    [_Exeunt Isabella, Lucio, and Provost._
_Ang._                   From thee,--even from thy virtue!
What's this, what's this? Is this her fault or mine?
The tempter or the tempted, who sins most?
Ha!
Not she; nor doth she tempt: but it is I                           165
That, lying by the violet in the sun,
Do as the carrion does, not as the flower,
Corrupt with virtuous season. Can it be
That modesty may more betray our sense
Than woman's lightness? Having waste ground enough,                170
Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary,
And pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie!
What dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo?
Dost thou desire her foully for those things
That make her good? O, let her brother live:                       175
Thieves for their robbery have authority
When judges steal themselves. What, do I love her,
That I desire to hear her speak again,
And feast upon her eyes? What is't I dream on?
O cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint,                           180
With saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous
Is that temptation that doth goad us on
To sin in loving virtue: never could the strumpet,
With all her double vigour, art and nature,
Once stir my temper; but this virtuous maid                        185
Subdues me quite. Ever till now,
When men were fond, I smiled, and wonder'd how. [_Exit._
