_Seb._                           Very well.
_Ant._ And most chirurgeonly.
_Gon._ It is foul weather in us all, good sir,                     135
When you are cloudy.
_Seb._             Foul weather?
_Ant._                         Very foul.
_Gon._ Had I plantation of this isle, my lord,--
_Ant._ He'ld sow't with nettle-seed.
_Seb._                             Or docks, or mallows.
_Gon._ And were the king on't, what would I do?
_Seb._ 'Scape being drunk for want of wine.                        140
_Gon._ I' the commonwealth I would by contraries
Execute all things; for no kind of traffic
Would I admit; no name of magistrate;
Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,
And use of service, none; contract, succession,                    145
Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;
No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;
No occupation; all men idle, all;
And women too, but innocent and pure;
No sovereignty;--                                                  150
_Seb._      Yet he would be king on't.
_Ant._ The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the
beginning.
_Gon._ All things in common nature should produce
Without sweat or endeavour: treason, felony,
Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,                    155
Would I not have; but nature should bring forth,
Of its own kind, all foison, all abundance,
To feed my innocent people.
_Seb._ No marrying 'mong his subjects?
_Ant._ None, man; all idle; whores and knaves.                     160
_Gon._ I would with such perfection govern, sir,
To excel the golden age.
_Seb._                 'Save his majesty!
_Ant._ Long live Gonzalo!
_Gon._                  And,--do you mark me, sir?
_Alon._ Prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me.
_Gon._ I do well believe your highness; and did it to minister     165
occasion to these gentlemen, who are of such sensible
and nimble lungs that they always use to laugh at nothing.
_Ant._ 'Twas you we laughed at.
_Gon._ Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing to
you: so you may continue, and laugh at nothing still.              170
_Ant._ What a blow was there given!
_Seb._ An it had not fallen flat-long.
_Gon._ You are gentlemen of brave mettle; you would
lift the moon out of her sphere, if she would continue in it
five weeks without changing.                                       175
  _Enter ARIEL (invisible) playing solemn music._
_Seb._ We would so, and then go a bat-fowling.
_Ant._ Nay, good my lord, be not angry.
_Gon._ No, I warrant you; I will not adventure my discretion
so weakly. Will you laugh me asleep, for I am very
heavy?                                                             180
_Ant._ Go sleep, and hear us.
            [_All sleep except Alon., Seb., and Ant._
_Alon._ What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes
Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find
They are inclined to do so.
_Seb._                    Please you, sir,
Do not omit the heavy offer of it:                                 185
It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,
It is a comforter.
_Ant._           We two, my lord,
Will guard your person while you take your rest,
And watch your safety.
_Alon._              Thank you.--Wondrous heavy.
                                [_Alonso sleeps. Exit Ariel._
_Seb._ What a strange drowsiness possesses them!                   190
_Ant._ It is the quality o' the climate.
