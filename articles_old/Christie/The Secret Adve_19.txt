Dash it all, Tommy, weve got to _do_ something for our money.
Tommy sighed.
Yes, I fear even the dear old Government will not support us at the
_Ritz_ in idleness for ever.
Therefore, as I said before, we must _do_ something.
Well, said Tommy, picking up the _Daily Mail_ again, _do_ it. I
shant stop you.
You see, continued Tuppence. Ive been thinking----
She was interrupted by a fresh bout of applause.
Its all very well for you to sit there being funny, Tommy. It would do
you no harm to do a little brain work too.
My union, Tuppence, my union! It does not permit me to work before 11
a.m.
Tommy, do you want something thrown at you? It is absolutely essential
that we should without delay map out a plan of campaign.
Hear, hear!
Well, lets do it.
Tommy laid his paper finally aside. Theres something of the simplicity
of the truly great mind about you, Tuppence. Fire ahead. Im listening.
To begin with, said Tuppence, what have we to go upon?
Absolutely nothing, said Tommy cheerily.
Wrong! Tuppence wagged an energetic finger. We have two distinct
clues.
What are they?
First clue, we know one of the gang.
Whittington?
Yes. Id recognize him anywhere.
Hum, said Tommy doubtfully, I dont call that much of a clue. You
dont know where to look for him, and its about a thousand to one
against your running against him by accident.
Im not so sure about that, replied Tuppence thoughtfully. Ive often
noticed that once coincidences start happening they go on happening in
the most extraordinary way. I dare say its some natural law that we
havent found out. Still, as you say, we cant rely on that. But there
_are_ places in London where simply every one is bound to turn up sooner
or later. Piccadilly Circus, for instance. One of my ideas was to take
up my stand there every day with a tray of flags.
What about meals? inquired the practical Tommy.
How like a man! What does mere food matter?
Thats all very well. Youve just had a thundering good breakfast. No
ones got a better appetite than you have, Tuppence, and by tea-time
youd be eating the flags, pins and all. But, honestly, I dont think
much of the idea. Whittington maynt be in London at all.
Thats true. Anyway, I think clue No. 2 is more promising.
Lets hear it.
Its nothing much. Only a Christian name--Rita. Whittington mentioned
it that day.
Are you proposing a third advertisement: Wanted, female crook,
answering to the name of Rita?
I am not. I propose to reason in a logical manner. That man, Danvers,
was shadowed on the way over, wasnt he? And its more likely to have
been a woman than a man----
I dont see that at all.
I am absolutely certain that it would be a woman, and a good-looking
one, replied Tuppence calmly.
On these technical points I bow to your decision, murmured Mr.
Beresford.
