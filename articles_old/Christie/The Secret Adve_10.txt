Tommy, you devil! almost screamed Tuppence. Give them to me. How
could you be so mean!
Your language, Tuppence, your language! Theyre very particular at the
National Gallery. Government show, you know. And do remember, as I have
pointed out to you before, that as a clergymans daughter----
I ought to be on the stage! finished Tuppence with a snap.
That is not what I intended to say. But if you are sure that you have
enjoyed to the full the reaction of joy after despair with which I have
kindly provided you free of charge, let us get down to our mail, as the
saying goes.
Tuppence snatched the two precious envelopes from him unceremoniously,
and scrutinized them carefully.
Thick paper, this one. It looks rich. Well keep it to the last and
open the other first.
Right you are. One, two, three, go!
Tuppences little thumb ripped open the envelope, and she extracted the
contents.
DEAR SIR,
Referring to your advertisement in this mornings paper, I may be able
to be of some use to you. Perhaps you could call and see me at the above
address at eleven oclock to-morrow morning.
Yours truly,
A. CARTER.
27 Carshalton Gardens, said Tuppence, referring to the address.
Thats Gloucester Road way. Plenty of time to get there if we tube.
The following, said Tommy, is the plan of campaign. It is my turn to
assume the offensive. Ushered into the presence of Mr. Carter, he and I
wish each other good morning as is customary. He then says: Please take
a seat, Mr.--er? To which I reply promptly and significantly: Edward
Whittington! whereupon Mr. Carter turns purple in the face and gasps
out: How much? Pocketing the usual fee of fifty pounds, I rejoin you
in the road outside, and we proceed to the next address and repeat the
performance.
Dont be absurd, Tommy. Now for the other letter. Oh, this is from the
_Ritz!_
A hundred pounds instead of fifty!
Ill read it:
DEAR SIR,
Re your advertisement, I should be glad if you would call round
somewhere about lunch-time.
Yours truly,
JULIUS P. HERSHEIMMER.
Ha! said Tommy. Do I smell a Boche? Or only an American millionaire
of unfortunate ancestry? At all events well call at lunch-time. Its a
good time--frequently leads to free food for two.
Tuppence nodded assent.
Now for Carter. Well have to hurry.
Carshalton Terrace proved to be an unimpeachable row of what Tuppence
called ladylike looking houses. They rang the bell at No. 27, and a
neat maid answered the door. She looked so respectable that Tuppences
heart sank. Upon Tommys request for Mr. Carter, she showed them into
a small study on the ground floor where she left them. Hardly a minute
elapsed, however, before the door opened, and a tall man with a lean
hawklike face and a tired manner entered the room.
Mr. Y. A.? he said, and smiled. His smile was distinctly attractive.
Do sit down, both of you.
