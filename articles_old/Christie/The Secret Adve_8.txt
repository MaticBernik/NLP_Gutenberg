Tuppence frowned severely.
We must think. Order some Turkish coffee, Tommy. Stimulating to the
brain. Oh, dear, what a lot I have eaten!
You have made rather a hog of yourself! So have I for that matter, but
I flatter myself that my choice of dishes was more judicious than yours.
Two coffees. (This was to the waiter.) One Turkish, one French.
Tuppence sipped her coffee with a deeply reflective air, and snubbed
Tommy when he spoke to her.
Be quiet. Im thinking.
Shades of Pelmanism! said Tommy, and relapsed into silence.
There! said Tuppence at last. Ive got a plan. Obviously what weve
got to do is to find out more about it all.
Tommy applauded.
Dont jeer. We can only find out through Whittington. We must discover
where he lives, what he does--sleuth him, in fact! Now I cant do it,
because he knows me, but he only saw you for a minute or two in Lyons.
Hes not likely to recognize you. After all, one young man is much like
another.
I repudiate that remark utterly. Im sure my pleasing features and
distinguished appearance would single me out from any crowd.
My plan is this, Tuppence went on calmly, Ill go alone to-morrow.
Ill put him off again like I did to-day. It doesnt matter if I dont
get any more money at once. Fifty pounds ought to last us a few days.
Or even longer!
Youll hang about outside. When I come out I shant speak to you in
case hes watching. But Ill take up my stand somewhere near, and when
he comes out of the building Ill drop a handkerchief or something, and
off you go!
Off I go where?
Follow him, of course, silly! What do you think of the idea?
Sort of thing one reads about in books. I somehow feel that in real
life one will feel a bit of an ass standing in the street for hours with
nothing to do. People will wonder what Im up to.
Not in the city. Every ones in such a hurry. Probably no one will even
notice you at all.
Thats the second time youve made that sort of remark. Never mind, I
forgive you. Anyway, it will be rather a lark. What are you doing this
afternoon?
Well, said Tuppence meditatively. I _had_ thought of hats! Or perhaps
silk stockings! Or perhaps----
Hold hard, admonished Tommy. Theres a limit to fifty pounds! But
lets do dinner and a show to-night at all events.
Rather.
The day passed pleasantly. The evening even more so. Two of the
five-pound notes were now irretrievably dead.
They met by arrangement the following morning and proceeded citywards.
Tommy remained on the opposite side of the road while Tuppence plunged
into the building.
Tommy strolled slowly down to the end of the street, then back again.
Just as he came abreast of the building, Tuppence darted across the
road.
Tommy!
Yes. Whats up?
The place is shut. I cant make anyone hear.
