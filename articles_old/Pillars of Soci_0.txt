Mrs. Rummel: Oh, you need not look back more than fourteen or fifteen
years. God forgive us, what a life we led! There used to be a Dancing
Society and a Musical Society--
Mrs. Bernick:  And the Dramatic Club. I remember it very well.
Mrs. Rummel: Yes, that was where your play was performed, Mr. Tonnesen.
Hilmar (from the back of the room): What, what?
Rorlund: A play by Mr. Tonnesen?
Mrs. Rummel: Yes, it was long before you came here, Mr. Rorlund. And it
was only performed once.
Mrs. Lynge: Was that not the play in which you told me you took the
part of a young man's sweetheart, Mrs. Rummel?
Mrs. Rummel (glancing towards RORLUND): I? I really cannot remember,
Mrs. Lynge. But I remember well all the riotous gaiety that used to go
on.
Mrs. Holt: Yes, there were houses I could name in which two large
dinner-parties were given in one week.
Mrs. Lynge: And surely I have heard that a touring theatrical company
came here, too?
Mrs. Rummel: Yes, that was the worst thing of the lot.
Mrs. Holt (uneasily):  Ahem!
Mrs. Rummel: Did you say a theatrical company? No, I don't remember
that at all.
Mrs. Lynge: Oh yes, and I have been told they played all sorts of mad
pranks. What is really the truth of those stories?
Mrs. Rummel: There is practically no truth in them, Mrs. Lynge.
Mrs. Holt: Dina, my love, will you give me that linen?
Mrs. Bernick (at the same time): Dina, dear, will you go and ask
Katrine to bring us our coffee?
Martha: I will go with you, Dina. (DINA and MARTHA go out by the
farther door on, the left.)
Mrs. Bernick (getting up): Will you excuse me for a few minutes? I
think we will have our coffee outside. (She goes out to the verandah
and sets to work to lay a table. RORLUND stands in the doorway talking
to her. HILMAR sits outside, smoking.)
Mrs. Rummel (in a low voice): My goodness, Mrs. Lynge, how you
frightened me!
Mrs. Lynge: I?
Mrs. Holt: Yes, but you know it was you that began it, Mrs. Rummel.
Mrs. Rummel: I? How can you say such a thing, Mrs. Holt? Not a syllable
passed my lips!
Mrs. Lynge: But what does it all mean?
Mrs. Rummel:  What made you begin to talk about--? Think--did you not
see that Dina was in the room?
Mrs. Lynge:  Dina? Good gracious, is there anything wrong with--?
Mrs. Holt: And in this house, too! Did you not know it was Mrs.
Bernick's brother--?
Mrs. Lynge: What about him? I know nothing about it at all; I am quite
new to the place, you know.
Mrs. Rummel: Have you not heard that--? Ahem! (To her daughter) Hilda,
dear, you can go for a little stroll in the garden?
Mrs. Holt: You go too, Netta. And be very kind to poor Dina when she
comes back. (HILDA and NETTA go out into the garden.)
