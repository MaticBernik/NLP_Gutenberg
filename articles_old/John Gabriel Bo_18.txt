FOLDAL.
  But, my dear friend, who can have got him to see things in
that light?
BORKMAN.
  Who?  Do you forget who has brought him up?  First his aunt,
from the time he was six or seven years old; and now, of late
years, his mother!
FOLDAL.
  I believe you are doing them an injustice.
BORKMAN.
  [Firing up.]  I never do any one injustice!  Both of them have
gone and poisoned his mind against me, I tell you!
FOLDAL.
  [Soothingly.]  Well, well, well, I suppose they have.
BORKMAN.
  [Indignantly.]  Oh these women!  They wreck and ruin life for
us!  Play the devil with our whole destiny--our triumphal progress.
FOLDAL.
  Not all of them!
BORKMAN.
  Indeed?  Can you tell me of a single one that is good for
anything?
FOLDAL.
  No, that is the trouble.  The few that I know are good for
nothing.
BORKMAN.
  [With a snort of scorn.]  Well then, what is the good of it?
What is the good of such women existing--if you never know them?
FOLDAL.
  [Warmly.]  Yes, John Gabriel, there is good in it, I assure you.
It is such a blessed, beneficial thought that here or there in the
world, somewhere, far away--the true woman exists after all.
BORKMAN.
  [Moving impatiently on the sofa.]  Oh, do spare me that poetical
nonsense.
FOLDAL.
  [Looks at him, deeply wounded.]  Do you call my holiest faith
poetical nonsense?
BORKMAN.
  [Harshly.]  Yes I do!  That is what has always prevented you
from getting on in the world.  If you would get all that out of
your head, I could still help you on in life--help you to rise.
FOLDAL.
  [Boiling inwardly.]  Oh, you can't do that.
BORKMAN.
  I can when once I come into power again.
FOLDAL.
  That won't be for many a day.
BORKMAN.
  [Vehemently.]  Perhaps you think that day will never come?
Answer me!
FOLDAL.
  I don't know what to answer.
BORKMAN.
  [Rising, cold and dignified, and waving his hand towards the
door.]  Then I no longer have any use for you.
FOLDAL.
  [Starting up.]  No use----!
BORKMAN.
  Since you do not believe that the tide will turn for me----
FOLDAL.
  How can I believe in the teeth of all reason?  You would have
to be legally rehabilitated----
BORKMAN.
  Go on! go on!
FOLDAL.
  It's true I never passed my examination; but I have read enough
law to know that----
BORKMAN.
  [Quickly.]  It is impossible, you mean?
FOLDAL.
  There is no precedent for such a thing.
BORKMAN.
  Exceptional men are above precedents.
FOLDAL.
  The law knows nothing of such distinctions.
BORKMAN.
  [Harshly and decisively.]  You are no poet, Vilhelm.
FOLDAL.
  [Unconsciously folding his hands.]  Do you say that in sober
earnest?
BORKMAN.
  [Dismissing the subject, without answering.]  We are only
wasting each other's time.  You had better not come here again.
FOLDAL.
  Then you really want me to leave you?
BORKMAN.
  [Without looking at him.]  I have no longer any use for you.
FOLDAL.
  [Softly, taking his portfolio.]  No, no, no; I daresay not.
BORKMAN.
  Here you have been lying to me all the time.
