Enough to give a baby cold, Mrs. Gradgrind considered.
Cold?  I was born with inflammation of the lungs, and of everything
else, I believe, that was capable of inflammation, returned Mr.
Bounderby.  For years, maam, I was one of the most miserable little
wretches ever seen.  I was so sickly, that I was always moaning and
groaning.  I was so ragged and dirty, that you wouldnt have touched me
with a pair of tongs.
Mrs. Gradgrind faintly looked at the tongs, as the most appropriate thing
her imbecility could think of doing.
How I fought through it, _I_ dont know, said Bounderby.  I was
determined, I suppose.  I have been a determined character in later life,
and I suppose I was then.  Here I am, Mrs. Gradgrind, anyhow, and nobody
to thank for my being here, but myself.
Mrs. Gradgrind meekly and weakly hoped that his mother
_My_ mother?  Bolted, maam! said Bounderby.
Mrs. Gradgrind, stunned as usual, collapsed and gave it up.
My mother left me to my grandmother, said Bounderby; and, according to
the best of my remembrance, my grandmother was the wickedest and the
worst old woman that ever lived.  If I got a little pair of shoes by any
chance, she would take em off and sell em for drink.  Why, I have known
that grandmother of mine lie in her bed and drink her four-teen glasses
of liquor before breakfast!
Mrs. Gradgrind, weakly smiling, and giving no other sign of vitality,
looked (as she always did) like an indifferently executed transparency of
a small female figure, without enough light behind it.
She kept a chandlers shop, pursued Bounderby, and kept me in an
egg-box.  That was the cot of _my_ infancy; an old egg-box.  As soon as I
was big enough to run away, of course I ran away.  Then I became a young
vagabond; and instead of one old woman knocking me about and starving me,
everybody of all ages knocked me about and starved me.  They were right;
they had no business to do anything else.  I was a nuisance, an
incumbrance, and a pest.  I know that very well.
His pride in having at any time of his life achieved such a great social
distinction as to be a nuisance, an incumbrance, and a pest, was only to
be satisfied by three sonorous repetitions of the boast.
I was to pull through it, I suppose, Mrs. Gradgrind.  Whether I was to
do it or not, maam, I did it.  I pulled through it, though nobody threw
me out a rope.  Vagabond, errand-boy, vagabond, labourer, porter, clerk,
chief manager, small partner, Josiah Bounderby of Coketown.  Those are
the antecedents, and the culmination.  Josiah Bounderby of Coketown
learnt his letters from the outsides of the shops, Mrs. Gradgrind, and
was first able to tell the time upon a dial-plate, from studying the
steeple clock of St. Giless Church, London, under the direction of a
drunken cripple, who was a convicted thief, and an incorrigible vagrant.
Tell Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, of your district schools and your
model schools, and your training schools, and your whole kettle-of-fish
of schools; and Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, tells you plainly, all
right, all correcthe hadnt such advantagesbut let us have hard-headed,
solid-fisted peoplethe education that made him wont do for everybody,
he knows wellsuch and such his education was, however, and you may force
him to swallow boiling fat, but you shall never force him to suppress the
facts of his life.
