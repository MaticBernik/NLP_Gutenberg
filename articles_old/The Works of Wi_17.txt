ACT II.
SCENE I. _Padua_. _A room in_ BAPTISTA'S _house_.
_Enter_ KATHARINA _and_ BIANCA.
    _Bian._ Good sister, wrong me not, nor wrong yourself,
    To make a bondmaid and a slave of me;
    That I disdain: but for these other gawds,
    Unbind my hands, I 'll pull them off myself,
    Yea, all my raiment, to my petticoat;                              5
    Or what you will command me will I do,
    So well I know my duty to my elders.
    _Kath._ Of all thy suitors, here I charge thee, tell
    Whom thou lovest best: see thou dissemble not.
    _Bian._ Believe me, sister, of all the men alive                  10
    I never yet beheld that special face
    Which I could fancy more than any other.
    _Kath._ Minion, thou liest. Is't not Hortensio?
    _Bian._ If you affect him, sister, here I swear
    I'll plead for you myself, but you shall have him.                15
    _Kath._ O then, belike, you fancy riches more:
    You will have Gremio to keep you fair.
    _Bian._ Is it for him you do envy me so?
    Nay then you jest, and now I well perceive
    You have but jested with me all this while:                       20
    I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands.
    _Kath._ If that be jest, then all the rest was so.
                                                 [_Strikes her._
_Enter_ BAPTISTA.
    _Bap._ Why, how now, dame! whence grows this insolence?
    Bianca, stand aside. Poor girl! she weeps.
    Go ply thy needle; meddle not with her.                           25
    For shame, thou hilding of a devilish spirit,
    Why dost thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong thee?
    When did she cross thee with a bitter word?
    _Kath._ Her silence flouts me, and I'll be revenged.
                                          [_Flies after Bianca._
    _Bap._ What, in my sight? Bianca, get thee in.                    30
                                                 [_Exit Bianca._
    _Kath._ What, will you not suffer me? Nay, now I see
    She is your treasure, she must have a husband;
    I must dance bare-foot on her wedding day
    And for your love to her lead apes in hell.
    Talk not to me: I will go sit and weep                            35
    Till I can find occasion of revenge.                [_Exit._
    _Bap._ Was ever gentleman thus grieved as I?
    But who comes here?
_Enter_ GREMIO, LUCENTIO _in the habit of a mean man_; PETRUCHIO, _with_
HORTENSIO _as a musician_; _and_ TRANIO, _with_ BIONDELLO _bearing a
lute and books_.
    _Gre._ Good morrow, neighbour Baptista.
    _Bap._ Good morrow, neighbour Gremio. God save you,               40
    gentlemen!
    _Pet._ And you, good sir! Pray, have you not a daughter
    Call'd Katharina, fair and virtuous?
    _Bap._ I have a daughter, sir, called Katharina.
