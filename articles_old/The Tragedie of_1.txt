With Martiall stalke,[1] hath he gone by our Watch.
_Hor_. In what particular thought to work, I know not:
But in the grosse and scope of my Opinion,              [Sidenote: mine]
This boades some strange erruption to our State.
_Mar_. Good now sit downe, and tell me he that knowes
[Sidenote: 16] Why this same strict and most obseruant Watch,[2]
So nightly toyles the subiect of the Land,
And why such dayly Cast of Brazon Cannon
                                    [Sidenote: And with such dayly cost]
And Forraigne Mart for Implements of warre:
Why such impresse of Ship-wrights, whose sore Taske
Do's not diuide the Sunday from the weeke,
What might be toward, that this sweaty hast[3]
Doth make the Night ioynt-Labourer with the day:
Who is't that can informe me?
_Hor._ That can I,
At least the whisper goes so: Our last King,
Whose Image euen but now appear'd to vs,
Was (as you know) by _Fortinbras_ of Norway,
(Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate Pride)[4]
Dar'd to the Combate. In which, our Valiant _Hamlet_,
(For so this side of our knowne world esteem'd him)[5]
[Sidenote: 6] Did slay this _Fortinbras_: who by a Seal'd Compact,
Well ratified by Law, and Heraldrie,                 [Sidenote: heraldy]
Did forfeite (with his life) all those his Lands       [Sidenote: these]
Which he stood seiz'd on,[6] to the Conqueror:    [Sidenote: seaz'd of,]
Against the which, a Moity[7] competent
Was gaged by our King: which had return'd        [Sidenote: had returne]
To the Inheritance of _Fortinbras_,
[Footnote 1: _1st Q_. 'Marshall stalke'.]
[Footnote 2: Here is set up a frame of external relations, to inclose
with fitting contrast, harmony, and suggestion, the coming show of
things. 273]
[Footnote 3: _1st Q_. 'sweaty march'.]
[Footnote 4: Pride that leads to emulate: the ambition to excel--not
oneself, but another.]
[Footnote 5: The whole western hemisphere.]
[Footnote 6: _stood possessed of_.]

Had he bin Vanquisher, as by the same Cou'nant
                                             [Sidenote: the same comart]
And carriage of the Article designe,[1]           [Sidenote: desseigne,]
His fell to _Hamlet_. Now sir, young _Fortinbras_,
Of vnimproued[2] Mettle, hot and full,
Hath in the skirts of Norway, heere and there,
Shark'd[3] vp a List of Landlesse Resolutes,     [Sidenote: of lawlesse]
For Foode and Diet, to some Enterprize
That hath a stomacke in't[4]: which is no other
(And it doth well appeare vnto our State)              [Sidenote: As it]
But to recouer of vs by strong hand
And termes Compulsatiue, those foresaid Lands  [Sidenote: compulsatory,]
So by his Father lost: and this (I take it)
Is the maine Motiue of our Preparations,
The Sourse of this our Watch, and the cheefe head
Of this post-hast, and Romage[5] in the Land.
       [A]_Enter Ghost againe_.
But soft, behold: Loe, where it comes againe:
[Footnote A: _Here in the Quarto_:--
_Bar._ I thinke it be no other, but enso;
Well may it sort[6] that this portentous figure
Comes armed through our watch so like the King
That was and is the question of these warres.
