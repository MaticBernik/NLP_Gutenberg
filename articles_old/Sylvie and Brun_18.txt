Sylvie spent the time, while we were waiting for him, in making
_herself_ visible also. Its rather awkward, you know, she explained
to me, when we meet people, and they can see _one_ of us, and cant
see the _other_!
In a minute or two Bruno returned, looking rather disconsolate. Hed
got friends with him, and he were _cross_! he said. He asked me who I
were. And I said Im Bruno: who is _these_ peoples? And he said Ones
my half-brother, and tothers my half-sister: and I dont want no more
company! Go along with yer! And I said I cant go along _wizout_ mine
self! And I said Oo shouldnt have _bits_ of peoples lying about like
that! Its welly untidy! And he said Oh, dont talk to _me_! And he
pushted me outside! And he shutted the door!
And you never asked where Hunters farm was? queried Sylvie.
Hadnt room for any questions, said Bruno. The room were so crowded.
Three people _couldnt_ crowd a room, said Sylvie.
They _did_, though, Bruno persisted. _He_ crowded it most. Hes such
a welly _thick_ manso as oo couldnt knock him down.
I failed to see the drift of Brunos argument. Surely _anybody_ could
be knocked down, I said: thick or thin wouldnt matter.
Oo couldnt knock _him_ down, said Bruno. Hes more wider than hes
high: so, when hes lying down, hes more higher than when hes
standing: so a-course oo couldnt knock him _down_!
Heres another cottage, I said: _Ill_ ask the way, _this_ time.
There was no need to go in, this time, as the woman was standing in the
doorway, with a baby in her arms, talking to a respectably dressed mana
farmer, as I guessedwho seemed to be on his way to the town.
and when theres _drink_ to be had, he was saying, hes just the
worst o the lot, is your Willie. So they tell me. He gets fairly mad
wi it!
Id have given em the lie to their faces, a twelvemonth back! the
woman said in a broken voice. But a canna noo! A canna noo! She
checked herself, on catching sight of us, and hastily retreated into the
house, shutting the door after her.
Perhaps you can tell me where Hunters farm is? I said to the man, as
he turned away from the house.
I can _that_, Sir! he replied with a smile. Im John Hunter hissel,
at your sarvice. Its nobbut half a mile furtherthe only house in
sight, when you get round bend o the road yonder. Youll find my good
woman within, if so be youve business wi _her_. Or mebbe Ill do as
well?
Thanks, I said. I want to order some milk. Perhaps I had better
arrange it with your wife?
Aye, said the man. _She_ minds all _that_. Good day tye, Masterand
to your bonnie childer, as well! And he trudged on.
He should have said _child_, not _childer_, said Bruno. Sylvies
not a _childer_!
