    O _state of Being!_ where being's the only grief,
  And the _chief torture_'s to be damn'd to life;
  _O life!_ the only thing they have to hate;
  The _finish'd torment_ of a future state,
  Compleat in all the parts of endless misery,
  And worse ten thousand times than _not_ to BE!
  Could but the Damn'd _the immortal law_ repeal,
  And _Devils dye_, there'd be _an end of Hell_;
  Could they that thing call'd _Being_ annihilate,
  There'd be _no sorrows_ in a future state;
  The Wretch, whose crimes had shut him out _on high_,
  Could be reveng'd on God himself _and die_;
  _Job's Wife_ was in the right, and always we
  Might end _by death_ all human misery,              }
  Might have it in our choice, _to be_ or not to be.  }
CHAP. IV.
_Of the name of the Devil, his original, and the nature of his
     circumstances since he has been called by that name._
The Scripture is the first writing on earth where we find the _Devil_
called by his own proper distinguishing denomination, DEVIL, or the [5]
_Destroyer_; nor indeed is there any other author of antiquity or of
sufficient authority which says any thing of that kind about him.
Here he makes his first appearance in the world, and on that occasion he
is called the _Serpent_; but the _Serpent_ however since made to signify
the _Devil_, when spoken of in general terms, was but the Devil's
representative, or the Devil _in quo vis vehiculo_, for that time,
clothed in a bodily shape, acting under cover and in disguise, or if you
will the _Devil_ in _masquerade_: Nay, if we believe Mr. _Milton_, the
_Angel Gabriel_'s spear had such a secret powerful influence, as to make
him strip of a sudden, and with a touch to unmask, and stand upright in
his naked original shape, meer _Devil_, without any disguises
whatsoever.
Now as we go to the Scripture for much of his history, so we must go
there also for some of his names; and he has a great variety of names
indeed, as his several mischievous doings guide us to conceive of him.
The truth is, all the ancient names given him, of which the Scripture is
full, seems to be originals derived from and adapted to the several
steps he has taken, and the several shapes he has appeared in to do
mischief in the world.
