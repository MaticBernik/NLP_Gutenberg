Jack.  Good heavens!  [Motions Algernon away.]
Algernon.  Brother John, I have come down from town to tell you that I am
very sorry for all the trouble I have given you, and that I intend to
lead a better life in the future.  [Jack glares at him and does not take
his hand.]
Cecily.  Uncle Jack, you are not going to refuse your own brother's hand?
Jack.  Nothing will induce me to take his hand.  I think his coming down
here disgraceful.  He knows perfectly well why.
Cecily.  Uncle Jack, do be nice.  There is some good in every one.  Ernest
has just been telling me about his poor invalid friend Mr. Bunbury whom
he goes to visit so often.  And surely there must be much good in one who
is kind to an invalid, and leaves the pleasures of London to sit by a bed
of pain.
Jack.  Oh! he has been talking about Bunbury, has he?
Cecily.  Yes, he has told me all about poor Mr. Bunbury, and his terrible
state of health.
Jack.  Bunbury!  Well, I won't have him talk to you about Bunbury or
about anything else.  It is enough to drive one perfectly frantic.
Algernon.  Of course I admit that the faults were all on my side.  But I
must say that I think that Brother John's coldness to me is peculiarly
painful.  I expected a more enthusiastic welcome, especially considering
it is the first time I have come here.
Cecily.  Uncle Jack, if you don't shake hands with Ernest I will never
forgive you.
Jack.  Never forgive me?
Cecily.  Never, never, never!
Jack.  Well, this is the last time I shall ever do it.  [Shakes with
Algernon and glares.]
Chasuble.  It's pleasant, is it not, to see so perfect a reconciliation?
I think we might leave the two brothers together.
Miss Prism.  Cecily, you will come with us.
Cecily.  Certainly, Miss Prism.  My little task of reconciliation is
over.
Chasuble.  You have done a beautiful action to-day, dear child.
Miss Prism.  We must not be premature in our judgments.
Cecily.  I feel very happy.  [They all go off except Jack and Algernon.]
Jack.  You young scoundrel, Algy, you must get out of this place as soon
as possible.  I don't allow any Bunburying here.
[Enter Merriman.]
Merriman.  I have put Mr. Ernest's things in the room next to yours, sir.
I suppose that is all right?
Jack.  What?
Merriman.  Mr. Ernest's luggage, sir.  I have unpacked it and put it in
the room next to your own.
Jack.  His luggage?
Merriman.  Yes, sir.  Three portmanteaus, a dressing-case, two hat-boxes,
and a large luncheon-basket.
Algernon.  I am afraid I can't stay more than a week this time.
Jack.  Merriman, order the dog-cart at once.  Mr. Ernest has been
suddenly called back to town.
Merriman.  Yes, sir.  [Goes back into the house.]
Algernon.  What a fearful liar you are, Jack.  I have not been called
back to town at all.
Jack.  Yes, you have.
Algernon.  I haven't heard any one call me.
