SOLNESS.
[Looking at him with embarrassment.] Yes, but that is just what makes me
so horribly afraid.
DR. HERDAL.
Afraid? Because you have the luck on your side!
SOLNESS.
It terrifies me--terrifies me every hour of the day. For sooner or later
the luck must turn, you see.
DR. HERDAL.
Oh nonsense! What should make the luck turn?
SOLNESS.
[With firm assurance.] The younger generation!
DR. HERDAL.
Pooh! The younger generation! You are not laid on the shelf yet, I
should hope. Oh no--your position here is probably firmer now than it
has ever been.
SOLNESS.
The luck will turn. I know it--I feel the day approaching. Some one or
other will take it into his head to say: Give me a chance! And then all
the rest will come clamouring after him, and shake their fists at me and
shout: Make room--make room--! Yes, just you see, doctor--presently the
younger generation will come knocking at my door--
DR. HERDAL.
[Laughing.] Well, and what if they do?
SOLNESS.
What if they do? Then there's an end of Halvard Solness.
     [There is a knock at the door on the left.
SOLNESS.
[Starts.] What's that? Did you not hear something?
DR. HERDAL.
Some one is knocking at the door.
SOLNESS.
[Loudly.] Come in.
  HILDA WANGEL enters by the hall door.  She is of middle height,
  supple, and delicately built.  Somewhat sunburnt.  Dressed in
  a tourist costume, with skirt caught up for walking, a sailor's
  collar open at the throat, and a small sailor hat on her head.
  Knapsack on back, plaid in strap, and alpenstock.
HILDA.
[Goes straight up to SOLNESS, her eyes sparkling with happiness.] Good
evening!
SOLNESS.
[Looks doubtfully at her.] Good evening--
HILDA.
[Laughs.] I almost believe you don't recognise me!
SOLNESS.
No--I must admit that--just for the moment--
DR. HERDAL.
[Approaching.] But _I_ recognise you, my dear young lady--
HILDA.
[Pleased.] Oh, is it you that--
DR. HERDAL.
Of course it is. [To SOLNESS.] We met at one of the mountain stations
this summer. [To HILDA.] What became of the other ladies?
HILDA.
Oh, they went westward.
DR. HERDAL.
They didn't much like all the fun we used to have in the evenings.
HILDA.
No, I believe they didn't.
DR. HERDAL.
[Holds up his finger at her.] And I am afraid it can't be denied that
you flirted a little with us.
HILDA.
Well, that was better fun than to sit there knitting stockings with all
those old women.
DR. HERDAL.
[Laughs.] There I entirely agree with you!
SOLNESS.
Have you come to town this evening?
HILDA.
Yes, I have just arrived.
DR. HERDAL.
Quite alone, Miss Wangel?
HILDA.
Oh yes!
SOLNESS.
Wangel? Is your name Wangel?
HILDA.
[Looks in amused surprise at him.] Yes, of course it is.
SOLNESS.
Then you must be a daughter of the district doctor up at Lysanger?
HILDA.
[As before.] Yes, who else's daughter should I be?
SOLNESS.
Oh, then I suppose we met up there, that summer when I was building a
tower on the old church.
