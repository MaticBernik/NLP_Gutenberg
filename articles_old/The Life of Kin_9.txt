NYM.
They say he cried out of sack.
HOSTESS.
Ay, that 'a did.
BARDOLPH.
And of women.
HOSTESS.
Nay, that 'a did not.
BOY.
Yes, that 'a did; and said they were devils incarnate.
HOSTESS.
'A could never abide carnation; 'twas a colour he never liked.
BOY.
'A said once, the devil would have him about women.
HOSTESS.
'A did in some sort, indeed, handle women; but then he was
rheumatic, and talk'd of the whore of Babylon.
BOY.
Do you not remember, 'a saw a flea stick upon Bardolph's nose,
and 'a said it was a black soul burning in hell-fire?
BARDOLPH.
Well, the fuel is gone that maintain'd that fire.  That's all the
riches I got in his service.
NYM.
Shall we shog? The King will be gone from Southampton.
PISTOL.
Come, let's away. My love, give me thy lips.
Look to my chattels and my movables.
Let senses rule; the word is "Pitch and Pay."
Trust none;
For oaths are straws, men's faiths are wafer-cakes
And hold-fast is the only dog, my duck;
Therefore, Caveto be thy counsellor.
Go, clear thy crystals. Yoke-fellows in arms,
Let us to France; like horse-leeches, my boys,
To suck, to suck, the very blood to suck!
BOY.
And that's but unwholesome food, they say.
PISTOL.
Touch her soft mouth, and march.
BARDOLPH.
Farewell, hostess.
[Kissing her.]
NYM.
I cannot kiss; that is the humour of it; but, adieu.
PISTOL.
Let housewifery appear.  Keep close, I thee command.
HOSTESS.
Farewell; adieu.
[Exeunt.]
SCENE IV. France. The King's palace.
[Flourish. Enter the French King, the Dauphin, the Dukes of Berri
and Bretagne [the Constable, and others.]
FRENCH KING.
Thus comes the English with full power upon us,
And more than carefully it us concerns
To answer royally in our defences.
Therefore the Dukes of Berri and of Bretagne,
Of Brabant and of Orleans, shall make forth,
And you, Prince Dauphin, with all swift dispatch,
To line and new repair our towns of war
With men of courage and with means defendant;
For England his approaches makes as fierce
As waters to the sucking of a gulf.
It fits us then to be as provident
As fears may teach us out of late examples
Left by the fatal and neglected English
Upon our fields.
DAUPHIN.
My most redoubted father,
It is most meet we arm us 'gainst the foe;
For peace itself should not so dull a kingdom,
Though war nor no known quarrel were in question,
But that defences, musters, preparations,
Should be maintain'd, assembled, and collected,
As were a war in expectation.
Therefore, I say, 'tis meet we all go forth
To view the sick and feeble parts of France.
And let us do it with no show of fear;
No, with no more than if we heard that England
Were busied with a Whitsun morris-dance;
For, my good liege, she is so idly king'd,
Her sceptre so fantastically borne
By a vain, giddy, shallow, humorous youth,
That fear attends her not.
