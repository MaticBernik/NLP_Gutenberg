I should think any offer we get in answer to that would be a pretty
_un_reasonable one!
Tommy! Youre a genius! Thats ever so much more chic. No unreasonable
offer refused--if pay is good. Hows that?
I shouldnt mention pay again. It looks rather eager.
It couldnt look as eager as I feel! But perhaps you are right. Now
Ill read it straight through. Two young adventurers for hire. Willing
to do anything, go anywhere. Pay must be good. No unreasonable offer
refused. How would that strike you if you read it?
It would strike me as either being a hoax, or else written by a
lunatic.
Its not half so insane as a thing I read this morning beginning
Petunia and signed Best Boy. She tore out the leaf and handed it
to Tommy. There you are. _Times_, I think. Reply to Box so-and-so.
I expect it will be about five shillings. Heres half a crown for my
share.
Tommy was holding the paper thoughtfully. His faced burned a deeper red.
Shall we really try it? he said at last. Shall we, Tuppence? Just for
the fun of the thing?
Tommy, youre a sport! I knew you would be! Lets drink to success.
 She poured some cold dregs of tea into the two cups.
Heres to our joint venture, and may it prosper!
The Young Adventurers, Ltd.! responded Tommy.
They put down the cups and laughed rather uncertainly. Tuppence rose.
I must return to my palatial suite at the hostel.
Perhaps it is time I strolled round to the _Ritz_, agreed Tommy with a
grin. Where shall we meet? And when?
Twelve oclock to-morrow. Piccadilly Tube station. Will that suit you?
My time is my own, replied Mr. Beresford magnificently.
So long, then.
Good-bye, old thing.
The two young people went off in opposite directions. Tuppences hostel
was situated in what was charitably called Southern Belgravia. For
reasons of economy she did not take a bus.
She was half-way across St. Jamess Park, when a mans voice behind her
made her start.
Excuse me, it said. But may I speak to you for a moment?
CHAPTER II. MR. WHITTINGTONS OFFER
TUPPENCE turned sharply, but the words hovering on the tip of her tongue
remained unspoken, for the mans appearance and manner did not bear out
her first and most natural assumption. She hesitated. As if he read her
thoughts, the man said quickly:
I can assure you I mean no disrespect.
Tuppence believed him. Although she disliked and distrusted him
instinctively, she was inclined to acquit him of the particular motive
which she had at first attributed to him. She looked him up and down. He
was a big man, clean shaven, with a heavy jowl. His eyes were small and
cunning, and shifted their glance under her direct gaze.
Well, what is it? she asked.
The man smiled.
I happened to overhear part of your conversation with the young
gentleman in Lyons.
Well--what of it?
Nothing--except that I think I may be of some use to you.
