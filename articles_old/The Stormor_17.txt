'In _November_, 1675, happen'd a Storm at _North-West_, with a
Spring-tide, so violent, as gave apprehensions of some loss
irrecoverable to the Province of _Holland_, and by several breaches in
the great Diques near _Enchusen_, and others between _Amsterdam_ and
_Harlem_, made way for such Inundations as had not been seen before by
any man then alive, and fill'd the Country with many relations of most
deplorable Events. But the incredible Diligence and unanimous Endeavours
of the People upon such occasions, gave a stop to the Fury of that
Element, and made way for recovering next Year all the Lands, though not
the People, Cattel, and Houses that had been lost.'
      _Thus far_ Sir William Temple.
I am also credibly inform'd that the greatest Storm that ever we had in
_England_ before, and which was as universal here as this, did no Damage
in _Holland_ or _France_, comparable to this Tempest: I mean the great
Wind in 1661. An Abstract of which, as it was printed in _Mirabilis
Annis_, an unknown, but unquestion'd Author, take as follows, in his own
Words.
    _A dreadful Storm of Wind, accompanied with Thunder, Lightning, Hail
    and Rain; together with the sad Effects of it in many Parts of the
    Nation._
Upon the 18_th_ of _February_, 1661, being _Tuesday_, very early in the
Morning, there began a very great and dreadful Storm of Wind
(accompanied with Thunder, Lightning, Hail, and Rain, which in many
Places were as salt as Brine) which continued with a strange and unusual
Violence till almost Night: the sad Effects whereof throughout the
Nation are so many, that a very great Volume is not sufficient to
contain the Narrative of them. And indeed some of them are so
stupendious and amazing, that the Report of them, though from never so
authentick Hands, will scarce gain Credit among any but those that have
an affectionate Sense of the unlimited Power of the Almighty, knowing
and believing that there is nothing too hard for Him to do.
Some few of which wonderful Effects we shall give a brief Account of,
as we have received them from Persons of most unquestionable Credit in
the several Parts of the Nation.
In the City of _London_, and in _Covent Garden_ and other Parts about
_London_ and _Westminster_, five or six Persons were killed outright by
the Fall of Houses and Chimneys; especially one Mr. _Luke Blith_ an
Attorney, that lived at or near _Stamford_ in the County of _Lincoln_,
was killed that Day by the fall of a Riding-House not far from
_Pickadilla_: and there are some very remarkable Circumstances in this
Man's Case, which do make his Death to appear at least like a most
eminent Judgment and severe Stroak of the Lord's Hand upon him.
From other Parts likewise we have received certain Information, that
divers Persons were killed by the Effects of this great Wind.
At _Chiltenham_ in _Gloucestershire_, a Maid was killed by the Fall of a
Tree, in or near the Church-Yard.
