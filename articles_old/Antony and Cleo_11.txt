[Enter VENTIDIUS.]
O, come, Ventidius,
You must to Parthia: your commission's ready;
Follow me and receive it.
[Exeunt.]
SCENE IV.  Rome. A street.
[Enter LEPIDUS, MAECENAS, and AGRIPPA.]
LEPIDUS.
Trouble yourselves no further: pray you, hasten
Your generals after.
AGRIPPA.
Sir, Mark Antony
Will e'en but kiss Octavia, and we'll follow.
LEPIDUS.
Till I shall see you in your soldier's dress,
Which will become you both, farewell.
MAECENAS.
We shall,
As I conceive the journey, be at the mount
Before you, Lepidus.
LEPIDUS.
Your way is shorter;
My purposes do draw me much about.
You'll win two days upon me.
BOTH.
Sir, good success!
LEPIDUS.
Farewell.
[Exeunt.]
SCENE V. Alexandria. A Room in the Palace.
[Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, ALEXAS, and Attendants.]
CLEOPATRA.
Give me some music,--music, moody food
Of us that trade in love.
ALL.
The music, ho!
[Enter MARDIAN.]
CLEOPATRA.
Let it alone; let's to billiards:
Come, Charmian.
CHARMIAN.
My arm is sore; best play with Mardian.
CLEOPATRA.
As well a woman with an eunuch play'd
As with a woman.--Come, you'll play with me, sir?
MARDIAN.
As well as I can, madam.
CLEOPATRA.
And when good will is show'd, though't come too short,
The actor may plead pardon. I'll none now:--
Give me mine angle,--we'll to the river. There,
My music playing far off, I will betray
Tawny-finn'd fishes; my bended hook shall pierce
Their slimy jaws; and as I draw them up
I'll think them every one an Antony,
And say 'Ah ha! You're caught.'
CHARMIAN.
'Twas merry when
You wager'd on your angling; when your diver
Did hang a salt fish on his hook, which he
With fervency drew up.
CLEOPATRA.
That time?--O times!--
I laughed him out of patience; and that night
I laugh'd him into patience: and next morn,
Ere the ninth hour, I drunk him to his bed;
Then put my tires and mantles on him, whilst
I wore his sword Philippan.
[Enter a MESSENGER.]
O! from Italy!--
Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears,
That long time have been barren.
MESSENGER.
Madam, madam,--
CLEOPATRA.
Antony's dead!--
If thou say so, villain, thou kill'st thy mistress;
But well and free,
If thou so yield him, there is gold, and here
My bluest veins to kiss,--a hand that kings
Have lipp'd, and trembled kissing.
MESSENGER.
First, madam, he's well.
CLEOPATRA.
Why, there's more gold.
But, sirrah, mark, we use
To say the dead are well: bring it to that,
The gold I give thee will I melt and pour
Down thy ill-uttering throat.
MESSENGER.
Good madam, hear me.
CLEOPATRA.
Well, go to, I will;
But there's no goodness in thy face: if Antony
Be free and healthful,--why so tart a favour
To trumpet such good tidings! If not well,
Thou shouldst come like a fury crown'd with snakes,
Not like a formal man.
MESSENGER.
Will't please you hear me?
CLEOPATRA.
I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st:
Yet, if thou say Antony lives, is well,
Or friends with Caesar, or not captive to him,
I'll set thee in a shower of gold, and hail
Rich pearls upon thee.
