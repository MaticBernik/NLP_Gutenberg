LADY PLYMDALE.  Oh, you mustnt dream of such a thing.  Its most
dangerous nowadays for a husband to pay any attention to his wife in
public.  It always makes people think that he beats her when theyre
alone.  The world has grown so suspicious of anything that looks like a
happy married life.  But Ill tell you what it is at supper.  [_Moves
towards door of ball-room_.]
LORD WINDERMERE.  [_C._]  Margaret!  I _must_ speak to you.
LADY WINDERMERE.  Will you hold my fan for me, Lord Darlington?  Thanks.
[_Comes down to him_.]
LORD WINDERMERE.  [_Crossing to her_.]  Margaret, what you said before
dinner was, of course, impossible?
LADY WINDERMERE.  That woman is not coming here to-night!
LORD WINDERMERE.  [_R.C._]  Mrs. Erlynne is coming here, and if you in
any way annoy or wound her, you will bring shame and sorrow on us both.
Remember that!  Ah, Margaret! only trust me!  A wife should trust her
husband!
LADY WINDERMERE.  [_C._]  London is full of women who trust their
husbands.  One can always recognise them.  They look so thoroughly
unhappy.  I am not going to be one of them.  [_Moves up_.]  Lord
Darlington, will you give me back my fan, please?  Thanks. . . . A useful
thing a fan, isnt it? . . . I want a friend to-night, Lord Darlington: I
didnt know I would want one so soon.
LORD DARLINGTON.  Lady Windermere!  I knew the time would come some day;
but why to-night?
LORD WINDERMERE.  I _will_ tell her.  I must.  It would be terrible if
there were any scene.  Margaret . . .
PARKER.  Mrs. Erlynne!
[LORD WINDERMERE _starts_.  MRS. ERLYNNE _enters_, _very beautifully
dressed and very dignified_.  LADY WINDERMERE _clutches at her fan_,
_then lets it drop on the door_.  _She bows coldly to_ MRS. ERLYNNE, _who
bows to her sweetly in turn_, _and sails into the room_.]
LORD DARLINGTON.  You have dropped your fan, Lady Windermere.  [_Picks it
up and hands it to her_.]
MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_C._]  How do you do, again, Lord Windermere?  How
charming your sweet wife looks!  Quite a picture!
LORD WINDERMERE.  [_In a low voice_.]  It was terribly rash of you to
come!
MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_Smiling_.]  The wisest thing I ever did in my life.
And, by the way, you must pay me a good deal of attention this evening.
I am afraid of the women.  You must introduce me to some of them.  The
men I can always manage.  How do you do, Lord Augustus?  You have quite
neglected me lately.  I have not seen you since yesterday.  I am afraid
youre faithless.  Every one told me so.
LORD AUGUSTUS.  [_R._]  Now really, Mrs. Erlynne, allow me to explain.
MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_R.C._]  No, dear Lord Augustus, you cant explain
anything.  It is your chief charm.
LORD AUGUSTUS.  Ah! if you find charms in me, Mrs. Erlynne
[_They converse together_.  LORD WINDERMERE _moves uneasily about the
room watching_ MRS. ERLYNNE.]
LORD DARLINGTON.  [_To_ LADY WINDERMERE.]  How pale you are!
LADY WINDERMERE.  Cowards are always pale!
