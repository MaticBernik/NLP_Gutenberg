SCENE II. _The same._
  _Enter SIR HUGH EVANS and SIMPLE._
_Evans._ Go your ways, and ask of Doctor Caius' house
which is the way: and there dwells one Mistress Quickly,
which is in the manner of his nurse, or his dry nurse, or his
cook, or his laundry, his washer, and his wringer.
_Sim._ Well, sir.                                                    5
_Evans._ Nay, it is petter yet. Give her this letter; for
it is a 'oman that altogether's acquaintance with Mistress
Anne Page: and the letter is, to desire and require her to
solicit your master's desires to Mistress Anne Page. I
pray you, be gone: I will make an end of my dinner;                 10
there's pippins and cheese to come.    [_Exeunt._

SCENE III. _A room in the Garter Inn._
  _Enter FALSTAFF, Host, BARDOLPH, NYM, PISTOL, and ROBIN._
_Fal._ Mine host of the Garter!
_Host._ What says my bully-rook? speak scholarly and
wisely.
_Fal._ Truly, mine host, I must turn away some of my
followers.                                                           5
_Host._ Discard, bully Hercules; cashier: let them wag;
trot, trot.
_Fal._ I sit at ten pounds a week.
_Host._ Thou'rt an emperor, Caesar, Keisar, and Pheezar.
I will entertain Bardolph; he shall draw, he shall tap: said        10
I well, bully Hector?
_Fal._ Do so, good mine host.
_Host._ I have spoke; let him follow. [_To Bard._] Let
me see thee froth and lime: I am at a word; follow.    [_Exit._
_Fal._ Bardolph, follow him. A tapster is a good trade:             15
an old cloak makes a new jerkin; a withered serving-man
a fresh tapster. Go; adieu.
_Bard._ It is a life that I have desired: I will thrive.
_Pist._ O base Hungarian wight! wilt thou the spigot wield?
    [_Exit Bardolph._                                               20
_Nym._ He was gotten in drink: is not the humour
conceited?
_Fal._ I am glad I am so acquit of this tinder-box: his
thefts were too open; his filching was like an unskilful
singer; he kept not time.                                           25
_Nym._ The good humour is to steal at a minute's rest.
_Pist._ 'Convey,' the wise it call. 'Steal!' foh! a fico
for the phrase!
_Fal._ Well, sirs, I am almost out at heels.
_Pist._ Why, then, let kibes ensue.                                 30
_Fal._ There is no remedy; I must cony-catch; I must
shift.
_Pist._ Young ravens must have food.
_Fal._ Which of you know Ford of this town?
_Pist._ I ken the wight: he is of substance good.                   35
_Fal._ My honest lads, I will tell you what I am about.
_Pist._ Two yards, and more.
_Fal._ No quips now, Pistol! Indeed, I am in the waist
two yards about; but I am now about no waste; I am
about thrift. Briefly, I do mean to make love to Ford's             40
wife: I spy entertainment in her; she discourses, she carves,
she gives the leer of invitation: I can construe the action
of her familiar style; and the hardest voice of her behaviour,
to be Englished rightly, is, 'I am Sir John Falstaff's.'
