Kidderminster, said Mr. Childers, raising his voice, stow that!Sir,
to Mr. Gradgrind, I was addressing myself to you.  You may or you may
not be aware (for perhaps you have not been much in the audience), that
Jupe has missed his tip very often, lately.
Haswhat has he missed? asked Mr. Gradgrind, glancing at the potent
Bounderby for assistance.
Missed his tip.
Offered at the Garters four times last night, and never done em once,
said Master Kidderminster.  Missed his tip at the banners, too, and was
loose in his ponging.
Didnt do what he ought to do.  Was short in his leaps and bad in his
tumbling, Mr. Childers interpreted.
Oh! said Mr. Gradgrind, that is tip, is it?
In a general way thats missing his tip, Mr. E. W. B. Childers
answered.
Nine oils, Merrylegs, missing tips, garters, banners, and Ponging, eh!
ejaculated Bounderby, with his laugh of laughs.  Queer sort of company,
too, for a man who has raised himself!
Lower yourself, then, retorted Cupid.  Oh Lord! if youve raised
yourself so high as all that comes to, let yourself down a bit.
This is a very obtrusive lad! said Mr. Gradgrind, turning, and knitting
his brows on him.
Wed have had a young gentleman to meet you, if we had known you were
coming, retorted Master Kidderminster, nothing abashed.  Its a pity
you dont have a bespeak, being so particular.  Youre on the Tight-Jeff,
aint you?
What does this unmannerly boy mean, asked Mr. Gradgrind, eyeing him in
a sort of desperation, by Tight-Jeff?
There!  Get out, get out! said Mr. Childers, thrusting his young friend
from the room, rather in the prairie manner.  Tight-Jeff or Slack-Jeff,
it dont much signify: its only tight-rope and slack-rope.  You were
going to give me a message for Jupe?
Yes, I was.
Then, continued Mr. Childers, quickly, my opinion is, he will never
receive it.  Do you know much of him?
I never saw the man in my life.
I doubt if you ever _will_ see him now.  Its pretty plain to me, hes
off.
Do you mean that he has deserted his daughter?
Ay!  I mean, said Mr. Childers, with a nod, that he has cut.  He was
goosed last night, he was goosed the night before last, he was goosed
to-day.  He has lately got in the way of being always goosed, and he
cant stand it.
Why has he beenso very muchGoosed? asked Mr. Gradgrind, forcing the
word out of himself, with great solemnity and reluctance.
His joints are turning stiff, and he is getting used up, said Childers.
He has his points as a Cackler still, but he cant get a living out of
_them_.
A Cackler! Bounderby repeated.  Here we go again!
A speaker, if the gentleman likes it better, said Mr. E. W. B.
Childers, superciliously throwing the interpretation over his shoulder,
and accompanying it with a shake of his long hairwhich all shook at
once.  Now, its a remarkable fact, sir, that it cut that man deeper, to
know that his daughter knew of his being goosed, than to go through with
it.
