PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Shakes his head reproachfully.] You would never have been able to,
Irene. You had not the heart to do it.
IRENE.
No, in those days I had not that sort of heart.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
But since then? Afterwards?
IRENE.
Since then I have killed it innumerable times. By daylight and in the
dark. Killed it in hatred--and in revenge--and in anguish.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Goes close up to the table and asks softly.] Irene--tell me now
at last--after all these years--why did you go away from me? You
disappeared so utterly--left not a trace behind--
IRENE.
[Shaking her head slowly.] Oh Arnold--why should I tell you that
now--from the world beyond the grave.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Was there some one else whom you had come to love?
IRENE.
There was one who had no longer any use for my love--any use for my
life.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Changing the subject.] H'm--don't let us talk any more of the past--
IRENE.
No, no--by all means let us not talk of what is beyond the grave--what
is now beyond the grave for me.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Where have you been, Irene? All my inquiries were fruitless--you seemed
to have vanished away.
IRENE.
I went into the darkness--when the child stood transfigured in the
light.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Have you travelled much about the world?
IRENE.
Yes. Travelled in many lands.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Looks compassionately at her.] And what have you found to do, Irene?
IRENE.
[Turning her eyes upon him.] Wait a moment; let me see--. Yes, now I
have it. I have posed on the turntable in variety-shows. Posed as a
naked statue in living pictures. Raked in heaps of money. That was more
than I could do with you; for you had none.--And then I turned the
heads of all sorts of men. That too, was more than I could do with you,
Arnold. You kept yourself better in hand.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
[Hastening to pass the subject by.] And then you have married, too?
IRENE.
Yes; I married one of them.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Who is your husband?
IRENE.
He was a South American. A distinguished diplomatist. [Looks straight
in front of her with a stony smile.] Him I managed to drive quite out of
his mind; mad--incurably mad; inexorably mad.--It was great sport, I can
tell you--while it was in the doing. I could have laughed within me all
the time--if I had anything within me.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
And where is he now?
IRENE.
Oh, in a churchyard somewhere or other. With a fine handsome monument
over him. And with a bullet rattling in his skull.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Did he kill himself?
IRENE.
Yes, he was good enough to take that off my hands.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Do you not lament his loss, Irene?
IRENE.
[Not understanding.] Lament? What loss?
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Why, the loss of Herr von Satow, of course.
IRENE.
His name was not Satow.
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
Was it not?
IRENE.
My second husband is called Satow. He is a Russian--
PROFESSOR RUBEK.
