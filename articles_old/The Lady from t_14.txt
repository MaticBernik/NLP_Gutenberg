Wangel. Were you often together?
Ellida. No; not very often. One day he came out to our place, and looked
over the lighthouse. After that I got to know him, and we met now and
again. But then that happened about the captain, and so he had to go
away.
Wangel. Yes, yes. Tell me more about that.
Ellida. It was just daybreak when I had a note from him. He said in it
I was to go out to him at the Bratthammer. You know the headland there
between the lighthouse and Skjoldviken?
Wangel. I know, I know!
Ellida. I was to go out there at once, he wrote, because he wanted to
speak to me.
Wangel. And you went?
Ellida. Yes. I could not do otherwise. Well, then he told me he had
stabbed the captain in the night.
Wangel. He said that himself! Actually said so!
Ellida. Yes. But he had only acted rightly and justly, he said.
Wangel. Rightly and justly! Why did he stab him then?
Ellida. He wouldn't speak out about that. He said it was not fit for me
to hear.
Wangel. And you believed his naked, bare word?
Ellida. Yes. It never occurred to me to do otherwise. Well, anyhow, he
had to go away. But now, when he was to bid me farewell--. No; you never
could imagine what he thought of--
Wangel. Well? Tell me.
Ellida. He took from his pocket a key-ring--and drew a ring that he
always wore from his finger, and he took a small ring I had. These two
he put on the key-ring. And then he said we should wed ourselves to the
sea.
Wangel. Wed?
Ellida. Yes, so he said. And with that he threw the key-ring, and our
rings, with all his might, as far as he could into the deep.
Wangel. And you, Ellida, you did all this?
Ellida. Yes--only think--it then seemed to me as if it must be so. But,
thank God I--he went away.
Wangel. And when he was gone?
Ellida. Oh! You can surely understand that I soon came to my senses
again--that I saw how absolutely mad and meaningless it had all been.
Wangel. But you spoke just now of letters. So you have heard from him
since?
Ellida. Yes, I have heard from him. First I had a few short lines from
Archangel. He only wrote he was going to America. And then he told me
where to send an answer.
Wangel. And did you?
Ellida. At once. I wrote him, of course, that all must be at an end
between us; and that he must no longer think of me, just as I should no
longer think of him.
Wangel. But did he write again?
Ellida. Yes, he wrote again.
Wangel. And what was his answer to your communication?
Ellida. He took no notice of it. It was exactly as if I had never broken
with him. He wrote quite composedly and calmly that I must wait for him.
When he could have me he would let me know, and then I was to go to him
at once.
