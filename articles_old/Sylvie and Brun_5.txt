The case did not, I assured him, admit of a doubt.
The reason why Sylvies so cross Bruno went on very seriously,
almost sadly.
Sylvies eyes grew large and round with surprise at this new line of
enquiryher rosy face being perfectly radiant with good humour. But she
said nothing.
Wouldnt it be better to tell me after the lessons are over? I
suggested.
Very well, Bruno said with a resigned air: only she wont be cross
then.
Theres only three lessons to do, said Sylvie. Spelling, and
Geography, and Singing.
Not _Arithmetic_? I said.
No, he hasnt a head for Arithmetic
Course I havent! said Bruno. Mine heads for _hair_. I havent got a
_lot_ of heads!
and he cant learn his Multiplication-table
I like _History_ ever so much better, Bruno remarked. Oo has to
_repeat_ that Muddlecome table
Well, and you have to repeat
No, oo hasnt! Bruno interrupted. History repeats itself. The
Professor said so!
Sylvie was arranging some letters on a boardEVIL. Now, Bruno, she
said, what does _that_ spell?
Bruno looked at it, in solemn silence, for a minute. I knows what it
_doosnt_ spell! he said at last.
Thats no good, said Sylvie. What _does_ it spell?
Bruno took another look at the mysterious letters. Why, its LIVE,
backwards! he exclaimed. (I thought it was, indeed.)
How _did_ you manage to see that? said Sylvie.
I just twiddled my eyes, said Bruno, and then I saw it directly. Now
may I sing the King-fisher Song?
Geography next, said Sylvie. Dont you know the Rules?
I thinks there oughtnt to be such a lot of Rules, Sylvie! I thinks
Yes, there _ought_ to be such a lot of Rules, you wicked, wicked boy!
And how dare you _think_ at all about it? And shut up that mouth
directly!
So, as that mouth didnt seem inclined to shut up of itself, Sylvie
shut it for himwith both handsand sealed it with a kiss, just as you
would fasten up a letter.
Now that Bruno is fastened up from talking, she went on, turning to
me, Ill show you the Map he does his lessons on.
And there it was, a large Map of the World, spread out on the ground. It
was so large that Bruno had to crawl about on it, to point out the
places named in the King-fisher Lesson.
When a King-fisher sees a Lady-bird flying away, he says _Ceylon_, if
you _Candia_! And when he catches it, he says Come to _Media_! And if
youre _Hungary_ or thirsty, Ill give you some _Nubia_! When he takes
it in his claws, he says _Europe!_ When he puts it into his beak, he
says _India!_ When hes swallowed it, he says _Eton!_ Thats all.
Thats _quite_ perfect, said Sylvie. Now you may sing the King-fisher
Song.
Will _oo_ sing the chorus? Bruno said to me.
I was just beginning to say Im afraid I dont know the _words_, when
Sylvie silently turned the map over, and I found the words were all
written on the back. In one respect it was a _very_ peculiar song: the
chorus to each verse came in the _middle_, instead of at the _end_ of
it. However, the tune was so easy that I soon picked it up, and managed
the chorus as well, perhaps, as it is possible for _one_ person to
manage such a thing. It was in vain that I signed to Sylvie to help me:
she only smiled sweetly and shook her head.
