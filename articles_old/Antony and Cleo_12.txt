MESSENGER.
Madam, he's well.
CLEOPATRA.
Well said.
MESSENGER.
And friends with Caesar.
CLEOPATRA.
Th'art an honest man.
MESSENGER.
Caesar and he are greater friends than ever.
CLEOPATRA.
Make thee a fortune from me.
MESSENGER.
But yet, madam,--
CLEOPATRA.
I do not like 'but yet', it does allay
The good precedence; fie upon 'but yet'!
'But yet' is as a gaoler to bring forth
Some monstrous malefactor. Pr'ythee, friend,
Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear,
The good and bad together: he's friends with Caesar;
In state of health, thou say'st; and, thou say'st, free.
MESSENGER.
Free, madam! no; I made no such report:
He's bound unto Octavia.
CLEOPATRA.
For what good turn?
MESSENGER.
For the best turn i' the bed.
CLEOPATRA.
I am pale, Charmian.
MESSENGER.
Madam, he's married to Octavia.
CLEOPATRA.
The most infectious pestilence upon thee!
[Strikes him down.]
MESSENGER.
Good madam, patience.
CLEOPATRA.
What say you?--Hence,
[Strikes him again.]
Horrible villain! or I'll spurn thine eyes
Like balls before me; I'll unhair thy head:
[She hales him up and down.]
Thou shalt be whipp'd with wire and stew'd in brine,
Smarting in ling'ring pickle.
MESSENGER.
Gracious madam,
I that do bring the news made not the match.
CLEOPATRA.
Say 'tis not so, a province I will give thee,
And make thy fortunes proud: the blow thou hadst
Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage;
And I will boot thee with what gift beside
Thy modesty can beg.
MESSENGER.
He's married, madam.
CLEOPATRA.
Rogue, thou hast liv'd too long.
[Draws a dagger.]
MESSENGER.
Nay, then I'll run.--
What mean you, madam? I have made no fault.
[Exit.]
CHARMIAN.
Good madam, keep yourself within yourself:
The man is innocent.
CLEOPATRA.
Some innocents scape not the thunderbolt.--
Melt Egypt into Nile! and kindly creatures
Turn all to serpents!--Call the slave again:--
Though I am mad, I will not bite him:--call!
CHARMIAN.
He is afear'd to come.
CLEOPATRA.
I will not hurt him.
[Exit CHARMIAN.]
These hands do lack nobility, that they strike
A meaner than myself; since I myself
Have given myself the cause.
[Re-enter CHARMIAN and Messenger.]
Come hither, sir.
Though it be honest, it is never good
To bring bad news: give to a gracious message
An host of tongues; but let ill tidings tell
Themselves when they be felt.
MESSENGER.
I have done my duty.
CLEOPATRA.
Is he married?
I cannot hate thee worser than I do
If thou again say 'Yes.'
MESSENGER.
He's married, madam.
CLEOPATRA.
The gods confound thee! dost thou hold there still!
MESSENGER.
Should I lie, madam?
CLEOPATRA.
O, I would thou didst,
So half my Egypt were submerg'd, and made
A cistern for scal'd snakes! Go, get thee hence:
Hadst thou Narcissus in thy face, to me
Thou wouldst appear most ugly. He is married?
MESSENGER.
I crave your highness' pardon.
CLEOPATRA.
He is married?
MESSENGER.
Take no offence that I would not offend you:
To punish me for what you make me do
Seems much unequal: he's married to Octavia.
