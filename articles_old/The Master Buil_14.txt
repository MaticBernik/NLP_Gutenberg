HILDA.
Yes, indeed, you sang then. It sounded like harps in the air.
SOLNESS.
[Thoughtfully.] This is very strange--all this.
HILDA.
[Is silent awhile, looks at him and says in a low voice:] But then,--it
was after that--that the real thing happened.
SOLNESS.
The real thing?
HILDA.
[Sparking with vivacity.] Yes, I surely don't need to remind you of
that?
SOLNESS.
Oh yes do remind me a little of that, too.
HILDA.
Don't you remember that a great dinner was given in your honour at the
Club?
SOLNESS.
Yes, to be sure. It must have been the same afternoon, for I left the
place next morning.
HILDA.
And from the Club you were invited to come round to our house to supper.
SOLNESS.
Quite right, Miss Wangel. It is wonderful how all these trifles have
impressed themselves on your mind.
HILDA.
Trifles! I like that! Perhaps it was a trifle, too, that I was alone in
the room when you came in?
SOLNESS.
Were you alone?
HILDA.
[Without answering him.] You didn't call me a little devil then?
SOLNESS.
No, I suppose I did not.
HILDA.
You said I was lovely in my white dress, and that I looked like a little
princess.
SOLNESS.
I have no doubt you did, Miss Wangel.--And besides--I was feeling so
buoyant and free that day--
HILDA.
And then you said that when I grew up I should be your princess.
SOLNESS.
[Laughing a little.] Dear, dear--did I say that too?
HILDA.
Yes, you did. And when I asked how long I should have to wait, you
said that you would come again in ten years--like a troll--and carry me
off--to Spain or some such place. And you promised you would buy me a
kingdom there.
SOLNESS.
[As before.] Yes, after a good dinner one doesn't haggle about the
halfpence. But did I really say all that?
HILDA.
[Laughs to herself.] Yes. And you told me, too, what the kingdom was to
be called.
SOLNESS.
Well, what was it?
HILDA.
It was to be called the kingdom of Orangia,* you said.
  *In the original "Appelsinia," "appelsin" meaning "orange."
SOLNESS.
Well, that was an appetising name.
HILDA.
No, I didn't like it a bit; for it seemed as though you wanted to make
game of me.
SOLNESS.
I am sure that cannot have been my intention.
HILDA.
No, I should hope not--considering what you did next--
SOLNESS.
What in the world did I do next?
HILDA.
Well, that's the finishing touch, if you have forgotten that too. I
should have thought no one could help remembering such a thing as that.
SOLNESS.
Yes, yes, just give me a hint, and then perhaps---- Well?
HILDA.
[Looks fixedly at him.] You came and kissed me, Mr. Solness.
SOLNESS.
[Open-mouthed.] _I_ did!
HILDA.
Yes, indeed you did. You took me in both your arms, and bent my head
back, and kissed me--many times.
SOLNESS.
Now really, my dear Miss Wangel--!
HILDA.
[Rises.] You surely cannot mean to deny it?
