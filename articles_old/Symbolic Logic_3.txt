BOOK I.
THINGS AND THEIR ATTRIBUTES.
CHAPTER I.
_INTRODUCTORY._
The Universe contains '=Things=.'
    [For example, "I," "London," "roses," "redness," "old English
    books," "the letter which I received yesterday."]
Things have '=Attributes=.'
    [For example, "large," "red," "old," "which I received
    yesterday."]
One Thing may have many Attributes; and one Attribute may belong to many
Things.
    [Thus, the Thing "a rose" may have the Attributes "red,"
    "scented," "full-blown," &c.; and the Attribute "red" may belong
    to the Things "a rose," "a brick," "a ribbon," &c.]
