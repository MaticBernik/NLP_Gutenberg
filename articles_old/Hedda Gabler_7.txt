TESMAN.
Oh, scarcely at all. Perhaps a little, just at the moment--
HEDDA.
But what an idea, to pitch her bonnet about in the drawing-room! No one
does that sort of thing.
TESMAN.
Well you may be sure Aunt Julia won't do it again.
HEDDA.
In any case, I shall manage to make my peace with her.
TESMAN.
Yes, my dear, good Hedda, if you only would.
HEDDA.
When you call this afternoon, you might invite her to spend the evening
here.
TESMAN.
Yes, that I will. And there's one thing more you could do that would
delight her heart.
HEDDA.
What is it?
TESMAN.
If you could only prevail on yourself to say _du_(3) to her. For my
sake, Hedda? Eh?
HEDDA.
No, no, Tesman--you really mustn't ask that of me. I have told you so
already. I shall try to call her "Aunt"; and you must be satisfied with
that.
TESMAN.
Well well. Only I think now that you belong to the family, you--
HEDDA.
H'm--I can't in the least see why--
     [She goes up towards the middle doorway.
TESMAN.
[After a pause.] Is there anything the matter with you, Hedda? Eh?
HEDDA.
I'm only looking at my old piano. It doesn't go at all well with all the
other things.
TESMAN.
The first time I draw my salary, we'll see about exchanging it.
HEDDA.
No, no--no exchanging. I don't want to part with it. Suppose we put it
there in the inner room, and then get another here in its place. When
it's convenient, I mean.
TESMAN.
[A little taken aback.] Yes--of course we could do that.
HEDDA.
[Takes up the bouquet from the piano.] These flowers were not here last
night when we arrived.
TESMAN.
Aunt Julia must have brought them for you.
HEDDA.
[Examining the bouquet.] A visiting-card. [Takes it out and reads:]
"Shall return later in the day." Can you guess whose card it is?
TESMAN.
No. Whose? Eh?
HEDDA.
The name is "Mrs. Elvsted."
TESMAN.
Is it really? Sheriff Elvsted's wife? Miss Rysing that was.
HEDDA.
Exactly. The girl with the irritating hair, that she was always showing
off. An old flame of yours I've been told.
TESMAN.
[Laughing.] Oh, that didn't last long; and it was before I met you,
Hedda. But fancy her being in town!
HEDDA.
It's odd that she should call upon us. I have scarcely seen her since we
left school.
TESMAN.
I haven't see her either for--heaven knows how long. I wonder how she
can endure to live in such an out-of-the way hole--eh?
HEDDA.
[After a moment's thought, says suddenly.] Tell me, Tesman--isn't it
somewhere near there that he--that--Eilert Lovborg is living?
TESMAN.
Yes, he is somewhere in that part of the country.
  BERTA enters by the hall door.
BERTA.
That lady, ma'am, that brought some flowers a little while ago, is here
again. [Pointing.] The flowers you have in your hand, ma'am.
HEDDA.
Ah, is she? Well, please show her in.
  BERTA opens the door for MRS. ELVSTED, and goes out herself.
  --MRS. ELVSTED is a woman of fragile figure, with pretty,
  soft features.  Her eyes are light blue, large, round, and
  somewhat prominent, with a startled, inquiring expression.
  Her hair is remarkably light, almost flaxen, and unusually
  abundant and wavy.  She is a couple of years younger than
  HEDDA.  She wears a dark visiting dress, tasteful, but not
  quite in the latest fashion.
